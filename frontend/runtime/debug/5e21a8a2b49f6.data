MOHAPATRA,J This appeal, filed by accused no.1 Babu Kuttan Ramkrishna Pillai and accused no.2 Umesh @ Babu Purshottam Bhatt of TADA ACT Spl.Case No.33 of 1994, is directed against the judgment and order dated 21.8.1998 of the Designated Court at Brihan `Mumbai under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 (for short TADA Act). In the said case seven accused persons faced trial under Section 120-B read with 307 r/w 34, 307 r/w 114, 307 r/w 149, 387 r/w 34, 143, 144, 147, 148 and 506 (ii), 353 r/w 114 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 3(2)(ii), 3(3), 3(5), 5 and 6 of the TADA Act and section r/w 25(IB)\r\n\r\n(a), Section 5 r/w 27 of the Arms Act. The gist of the prosecution case relevant for the purpose of this proceeding may be stated thus: With the growth of industry, commerce and trade in and around the city of Mumbai which generates substantial quantity of wealth, there has been increase of organised activities by gangs of anti-socials to extract money from affluent sections of society like developers, hoteliers and other businessmen by putting them in fear of death and then to demand substantial sums of money commonly known as &quot;Khadani&quot; i.e. protection money. One such gang was operating in the city under Amar Naik @ Bhai, who died a couple of years before the decision in the case at an encounter with the police. The prosecution alleged that in pursuance of a criminal conspiracy between 15.1.1994 to 16.5.1994 the accused persons and others of the gang embarked upon preparatory acts like procuring the information about the names of the builders of M/s Kalpataru Construction Company which was engaged in developing a property at Pali Hill, named Nakshatra Building. PW-7 Sudhir Tambe was the Senior Vice-President of the company with its head office at Nariman Point. He used to sit in the head- office. PW 6 Pachapur, Civil Engineer, was an employee of the company who used to remain at the site to supervise the construction. As the prosecution story runs, on 15.4.1994 between 11.30 a.m. and 12.00 noon while PW 6 was on duty at the construction site, accused no.3, Nitin Vasant Venugurlekar armed with revolver and accused No.4 Rajindera @ Rajan Mahadeo Margaj armed with a chopper and accused no.5 Jayendra @ Jai Anandrao Jadhav also armed with a chopper visited the site of Nakshatra Building; they threatened the workers at the site, forcibly brought PW 6 Pachapur in a room on the ground floor and man-handled him. Accused no.3, pointing a revolver at him demanded the name, address and telephone number of the builders. PW 6 disclosed the name of PW 7 Tambe and gave his telephone number to them. The accused then asked him to go to the office of the builders at Nariman Point and make the arrangement for a telephonic talk with Tambe. PW 6 rushed to the office and told Tambe of what had happened at the construction site. This was followed by telephonic calls from the accused who wanted to speak to Tambe. Attempts were made by PW 6 and PW 7 to avoid any discussion with the gangsters. Two or three days thereafter when the accused got Tambe on the telephone he (Tambe) gave them some other telephone numbers and asked them to contact those persons including one D.N.Ghosh, the Security Contractor. Eight/ten days thereafter again a telephone call was made to the office of Tambe which was received by PW 6 who was informed by the person making the call that they could not get D. N. Ghosh on the telephone numbers furnished by Tambe. Thereafter PW 6 handed over the receiver to Tambe. This incident was followed by several threats given by the gangsters to workers and also repeated telephone calls made to the Head Office of the company to contact Tambe. The staff of the site office absented from work resulting in virtual closure of construction activity. On 11.5.1994 the deceased Sanjay Patil telephoned to Tambe and warned him that he is wasting time and should meet him without further delay. After some days there was one more similar call from Sanjay Patil and he asked Tambe that he should talk to Bhai and saying so he handed over the receiver to another person who gave his identity as Amar Naik (since deceased), who told Tambe that he should pay Rs.10 lacs. The later pleaded his inability to pay such a heavy sum and after some discussion agreed to pay Rs.5 lacs. He was asked to come to Nakshatra Building site on 16.5.1994 along with money. In the meantime Tambe informed all the happenings to the Addl. Commissioner of Police Mr.Sanjeev Dayal and the then Dy. Commissioner of Police of Zone VII Mr. Rajanish Sheth within whose jurisdiction Khar Police Station fell.\r\n\r\nOn 16.5.1994 at about 12.00 noon the deceased Sanjay Patil telephoned Tambe and inquired from him as to what he was going to do about the payment and then Tambe replied that he will be leaving office at about 2.00 p.m. for Pali Hill. Sanjay Patil cautioned him that he should not make any haste and he should wait for his call so that he will take necessary instructions from his boss i.e. Amar Naik. At about 2.00 p.m. on that day there was a telephone call from Sanjay Patil telling that Tambe should not meet him at the Nakshatra Building site but instead he should meet him near the Ceaser Palace Hotel. This telephonic conversation was tape-recorded. Tambe was instructed on telephone that his man shall carry a white plastic bag containing the amount of Rs.5 lacs and shall wait near the entrance gate of Ceaser\r\n Indian Penal Code Section 120-B r/w 307, 34 likewise 307, r/w 114, 149 and 387 r/w 34, 143, 144, 147, 148 and 506(ii), 353 r/w 114 - Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 `TADA Act&#39; 25(IB)(a) - the Arms Act Section 5, 27 - Indian Penal Code, Section 120-B and 395 considered as saw - charged sentenced detainment for a long time - We do not find that the appreciation of evidence made by the learned trial Judge suffers from any illegality nor can findings recorded by him be said to be perverse- Appeal rejected.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n Appeal Dismissed','Shamkant Narayan Despande Vs Maharashtra Industrial CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Special Leave petition (c) No.\n4748 of 1991.\nFrom the Judgment and Order dated 21.1.91 of the Bombay High\nCourt in W.P. No. 3481 of 1990.\nN.B. Shetye,  P.M.  Pradhan  and  A.M.	khanwilkar  for	 the\npetitioner.\nDushyant Dave, Beliram Vakil, Abrar Ali, Ajit Yogi, Gajender\nLal, Mukul Gupta and Ms. Sonia Khan for the Respondents.\nThe Judgment of the court was delivered by\n     SAWANT,  J.   The	petitioner  is	diploma-  holder  in\nEngineering  and holds the post of Executive Engineer in the\nrespondent-Corporation. Till 1974, the promotion post of the\nsuperintending Engineer	 was  available	 both  for  diploma-\nholders and degree-holders according to merit-cum-seniority.\nThis was  so according	to  the	 practice  followed  by	 the\nCorporation without  making any	 rules or regulation in that\nbehalf. In  1974, the corporation made regulation by passing\na resolution  by passing a resolution and continued the same\npractice. Admittedly,  the regulation  were not	 made  under\nsection 64  of the  Maharashtra Industrial  Development Act,\n1961 [hereinafter  referred to as the &apos;Act&apos;] under which the\nrespondent-corporation was  created. Thereafter in 1988, the\ncorporation passed a resolution, for the first time,. making\n75 per	cent of	   the	posts  of  superintending  engineers\navailable to  the executive Engineers holding degrees and 25\nper cent  to  the  Executive  Engineers	 who  were  diploma-\nholders.  This	 resolution  was   also	 admittedly   not  a\nregulation made	 under the   said  section 64.	But for this\nresolution, the	 petitioner who was senior to respondent NO.\n2 would	 have been  promoted to	 the post  of Superintending\nEngineer on  31st October,  1990. However,  since respondent\nNo.2 was a degree holder, he got the said resolution and was\npromoted to the said post on that date. It is this promotion\nwhich was challenged by the petitioner by a writ petition in\nthe High  Court. The  High Court  by the  impugned  judgment\ndismissed the said petition.\n     2.	 Two   contentions  were  raised\n     before us.\n     (i) that no classification could be\n     made among	 the Executive Engineers\n     on the  basis of  their educational\n     qualification for	the  purpose  of\n     promotion	 to    the    post    of\n     superintending Engineer, since they\n     belong  to	  the  same   cadre   of\n     Executive Engineers and do the same\n     work.  There   was	 also  a  common\n     seniority	  of	the    Executive\n     Engineers	maintained.   hence  the\n     classification  was  discriminatory\n     in nature and violative of Articles\n     14 and 16 of the Constitution .\n     (ii)  that	  if  at   all	such   a\n     discrimination was	 permissible, it\n     could be  made only  be a statutory\n     rule  or  regulation  framed  under\n     Section 64	 of the said Act. A mere\n     resolution	   or	 an    executive\n     instruction could	not effect  such\n     discrimination.\n3.   We find  not merit in either of the two contentions. It\nis now	well settled  that for	the purpose  of promotion, a\nvalid classification  can made among the members holding the\nsame post  on the  basis of their qualification. In state of\nJummu &amp;	 Kashmir v.  Triloki Nath Khosa &amp; Ors., [1974] 1 SCR\n771, a Constitution Bench of his court has clearly held that\nsuch a	classification is  permissible and  does not violate\nArticles 14  and  16  of  the  Constitution  the  Court	 has\nobserved there that in state of Mysore &amp; Anr. v. P. Narasing\nRao, [1968]  1 SCR  407 and The Union of India and others v.\nDr.(Mrs.) S.B.	Kholi, AIR  1973 SC 811, it was already held\nthat   classification	 on   the   basis   of	 educational\nqualification was  permissible. The  Court then	 referred to\nRoshan Lal  Tandon v.  Union of India, [1968] 1 SCR  185 and\ndistinguished it  on the facts by pointing out that it was a\ncase of	 the direct  recruits and  promotees integrated into\none cadre.  Once they  were integrated they lost their birth\nbirth-marks, viz.  the different   sources  from which	they\nwere recruited.	 [Emphasis supplied].  The court pointed out\nthat Roshan Lal&apos;s case [supra] was thus no authority for the\nproposition that  if direct  recruits  and    promotees	 are\nintegrated into	 one class  they cannot	 be  classified	 for\npurposed of promotion on a basis other than that in the case\nbefore the them the classified for purpose of promotion on a\nbasis  other  than  that  they	were  drawn  from  different\nsources. The  court also  pointed out  that the	 very  Bench\nwhich decided  Roshan Lal&apos;s    case  [supra]  he Constitution of India, Art.14, Art.16 - Promotion to post of Superintending Engineer - Classification of degree-holder and confirmation holder Executive Engineers - Not violative Arts. 14 and 16. \r\n\r\nMaharashtra Industrial Development Act (3 of 1962), S.64. \r\n\r\nAIR 1983 SC 881, Held per incuriam. \r\n\r\nAIR 1974 SC 1, Foll. \r\n\r\nAdvancement - Classification among same class on premise of capabilities - Permissible. \r\n\r\nMaharashtra Industrial Development Act (3 of 1962), S.63 - Promotion to post of Superintending Engineer - Classification of degree holder and confirmation holder Executive Engineers - Made by Corporation by passing simple determination - Not illicit. \r\n\r\nAuthoritative law - Change in administration condition by passing simple determination - allowable. \r\n\r\nStates of Service - Can be changed by official guidelines.\r\n\r\nheld: The proposition that in the absence of the rules and regulations, the authority can act by executive instruction finds direct support in Mysore state Road Transport Corporation v.

','Shyamcharan Sharma Vs Dharamdas      CIVIL APPELLATE  JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 854, of\n1977.\n     Appeal by	Special Leave  from the	 Judgment and  order\ndated 2-8-1976	of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in S.A. No.\n440/71.\n     S. S. Khanduja and Lalit Kumar Gupta for the Appellant.\n     T. P. Naik and S. K. Gambhir for the Respondent.\n     The Judgment of the Court was delivered by\n     CHINNAPPA	REDDY,	 J.-The	 respondent-landlord  sought\neviction of  the appellant-tenant  from the suit premises an\ntwo grounds:  (i) failure  to pay  arrears of  rent  of	 Rs.\n158.25 despite service of notice of demand and (ii) bonafide\nrequirement of	premises for landlord&apos;s personal occupation.\nThe second  ground was	rejected by  all the  sub-  ordinate\ncourts and  we are  no longer concerned with that ground. In\nregard to  the first  ground, the trial Court found that the\ntenant was\n \nin arrears  of payment	of rent	 but  that  the	 tenant	 was\nentitled to the Protection of s. 12(3) of the Madhya Pradesh\nAccommodation Control Act, 1961, as the tenant had deposited\nthe arrears  of rent within the time allowed by the Court on\nhis application.  When the  appeal preferred by the landlord\nwas pending before the Additional District Judge, Satna, the\ntenant filed  an application  for condonation  of delay R in\ndepositing the	rent,  month  by  month,  which	 had  become\npayable after  the filing  of the  suit, as stipulated by s.\n13(1) of  the Act.  It appears	that, on  several occasions,\nwhen the  suit and  the appeal were pending before the trial\ncourt and  the appellate  court respectively, the tenant had\ndeposited the monthly rent a day or two or three, beyond the\nprescribed date.  The amount  had been received by the court\nand drawn  out	by  the	 landlord,  apparently	without	 any\nprotest. Taking	 advantage of  the filing  of  the  tenant&apos;s\napplication for condonation of delay, the landlord contended\nthat the  court had  no power to extend the time for deposit\nof the monthly rent and that he was entitled to a decree for\neviction  consequent   on  the	 non-compliance	  with	 the\nprovisions  of	 s.  13	  (  1	 )  of	the  Madhya  Pradesh\nAccommodation Control Act. The appellate court negatived the\nlandlord&apos;s contention and dismissed the appeal. The landlord\npreferred a  Second Appeal  to	the  High  Court  of  Madhya\nPradesh. The High Court, holding that the court had no power\nto extend  time, decreed  the suit for eviction. The tenant,\nhaving obtained special leave, has appealed to this Court.\n     Shri  Khanduja,  learned  counsel	for  the  appellant,\nraised two  contentions before	us. The first contention was\nthat the  High Court was wrong in holding that the Court had\nno power to condone the delay in depositing the monthly rent\nfalling due  after the	filing of the suit for eviction. The\nsecond contention  was that,  in the  circumstances  of	 the\ncase. the  respondent must  be considered  to have waived or\nabandoned the right to insist on dis-entitling the tenant of\nthe protection	to which  he was  otherwise  entitled.	Shri\nNaik, learned  counsel for  the respondent, contended to the\ncontrary on both the questions.\n     The Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Control Act, 1961, was\nenacted, as recited in the statement of objects and reasons,\n\"for the  purpose of  controlling, letting  of and  rents of\nresidential  and  nonresidential  accommodation	 and  giving\nadequate protection  to tenants	 of  such  accommodation  in\nareas where there is dearth of accommodation\". Section 12(1)\nof the	Act provides  that no  suit shall  be-filed ill	 any\ncivil court  against a	tenant for  his	 eviction  from	 any\naccommodation except on one or more of the grounds specified\ntherein. Several  grounds are specified, such as, failure to\npay the	 arrears of  rent after	 the service  of  notice  of\ndemand, unlawful sub-letting of the whole or\n \npart of	 the accommodation, creation of a nuisance, bonafide\nrequirement of the accommodation by the landlord for his own\noccupation,   causing	of   substantial   damage   to	 the\naccommodation  etc.  etc.  The	ground	with  which  we	 are\nconcerned is that mentioned in s. 12(1) (a) and-it is: \"that\nthe tenant  has neither	 paid nor  tendered the whole of the\narrears of  rent legally  recoverable from  him	 within	 two\nmonths of  the date  on which  a notice	 of demand  for	 the\narrears of  rent has  been served  on him by the landlord in\nthe prescribed	manner\". Thus,	where a tenant is in arrears\nof rent,  a landlord  is obliged,  before instituting a suit\nfor eviction  on that  ground, to  serve a  notice of demand\ncalling upon  the tenant  to pay  or tender the whole of the\narrears of  rent within two months of the date of service of\nthe notice. S. 12(3) provides that an order for the eviction\nof a  tenant shall not be made on the ground specified in s.\n12(1) (a),  if	the  tenant  makes  payment  or	 deposit  as\nrequired by  s. 13.

On a few events, when the suit and \r\n\r\nthe interest were pending under the watchful eye of the trial court and	 the \r\n\r\ninvestigative court	 separately, the inhabitant had saved the \r\n\r\nmonth to month lease a day or a few past the endorsed \r\n\r\ndate, and the same had been gotten by the court and drawn \r\n\r\nout by	the landowner, with no dissent. The landowner, \r\n\r\nexploiting the documenting of the occupant s application \r\n\r\nfor condonation	 of postponement, fought that the court had no \r\n\r\nenergy to amplify the ideal opportunity for store of the month to month lease and \r\n\r\nthat he	 was qualified for an announcement for expulsion resulting on \r\n\r\nthe resistance with the arrangements of area 13(1) of \r\n\r\nthe Act. The redrafting court negatived this dispute and \r\n\r\nrejected the interest.

The court had the purview to augment time \r\n\r\nfor store or installment of month to month lease falling due after the \r\n\r\nrecording of the suit. [338 G] \r\n\r\n2. Keeping in mind the end goal to qualifies an inhabitant for claim the insurance \r\n\r\nof area 12(3). the inhabitant needed to make installment or store \r\n\r\nas required by section	 13. The unfulfilled obligations of lease ought to be \r\n\r\npaid or	 stored inside one month of the administration of the \r\n\r\nwrit of summons on the inhabitant or inside such further time as \r\n\r\nmay he	allowed by the court, and ought to further store or \r\n\r\npay each month by the fifteenth. a whole identical to the lease. \r\n\r\n[338 A-B]. \r\n\r\n335 \r\n\r\n3. Failure	 to pay	 or store a whole identical to the \r\n\r\nlease by	 the fifteenth of consistently, ensuing to the recording \r\n\r\nof the	suit for removal will	 not entitle the proprietor, \r\n\r\nstraightaway, to a declaration for removal. The results of \r\n\r\nthe store or payment	 and non-installment or non-store are \r\n\r\nrecommended by subsection and (6) of segment 13. [338 B] \r\n\r\n4. A circumspection is vested in the court under segment \r\n\r\n13(6) to arrange the striking out of the, protection against \r\n\r\nexpulsion. [338 D] \r\n\r\n5. In the event that the court has the	discretion not to strike out \r\n\r\nthe protection or an inhabitant submitting default in installment or \r\n\r\nstore of lease as required by segment 13(1), the court \r\n\r\nmost likely has the further tact to approve the default and \r\n\r\namplify the ideal opportunity for installment or store. Such a tact is \r\n\r\na fundamental ramifications of the tact not to strike out \r\n\r\nthe defence.	Any other development may	lead, to a \r\n\r\ncorruption of the question of the Act. to be specific, \'the satisfactory \r\n\r\nsecurity of the occupant.\' [338 F-G] \r\n\r\n6. Section	 12(3) qualifies an inhabitant for claim insurance \r\n\r\nagainst removal on the ground indicated in area 12(1)(a) \r\n\r\nin the event that he makes installment or store as required by area 13. As \r\n\r\nthe court has under area 13, the ability to degree: the \r\n\r\ntime for installment or store, installment or store, inside the \r\n\r\naugmented time	 will entitle	 the inhabitant to claim	 the \r\n\r\ninsurance of segment 12(3).

The watchfulness given to the court under segment 13(6) \r\n\r\nmust suggest a caution to excuse the postponement and broaden the \r\n\r\ntime in	 making deposit	 or installment under area 13(1). \r\n\r\n[339A, E] \r\n\r\nJagdish Kapoor v.

In this case the appellant (hereinafter called\nthe  assessee) was assessed for the assessment year  1956-57\non  a  total income of Rs. 8,400.  The	Income	Tax  Officer\nlater  on came to know that the assessee&apos;s income  from	 the\nsale  of  estates had escaped assessment.  The	Income	Tax\nOfficer	 took action under section 34(1) (a) of	 the  Income\nTax   Act,  1922  (hereinafter	called	the  Act)  for	 the\nassessment year 1956-57 on 13th August, 1959.\nUnder  an  agreement dated 18th May, 1955 a  company  called\nMundakayam  Valley  Rubber Co. Ltd. sold  and  delivered  an\nestate called Kuttikal Estate to one Mr. A. V. George.	 The\narea  of the estate was 477 acres and 71 cents.	 Mr.  A.  V.\nGeorge had entered into the agreement in his own name and on\nbehalf of another company called the Kailas Rubber Co.	Ltd.\nIt  was agreed that the vendor would execute  the  necessary\nconveyance  in favour of Mr. A. V. George or  his  nominees.\nOn 15th August. 1955. the assessee entered into an agreement\nwith  Mr.  A.  V.  George whereby  the	assessee  agreed  to\npurchase  477.71 acres forming part of Kuttikal	 Estate	 for\nRs.  6	lakhs.	An advance of Rs. 1 1,000 was paid  by	the\nassessee.  The balance of Rs. 5,89,000 was to be paid by the\nassessee  on or before 25th September, 1955.  It was  agreed\nthat  Mr. A.  V. George should execute a sale-deed  himself\nor cause it to be executed Kailas Rubber Co. Ltd. on\n \nwhose behalf he was acting in favour of the assessee or	 his\nnominees.   The	 assessee subsequently divided the  area  of\n477.71	acres into 23 plots and found purchasers for  22  of\nthese,	plots.	 The total extent of 22 plots for  which  he\nfound  purchasers was 373.58 acres and the total price	paid\nby  the	 22 purchasers was Rs. 5,18,500.  A  sale  deed	 was\nexecuted  by the Mundakayam Valley Rubber Co. Ltd.  on	31st\nMarch, 1956.  It covered all the 23 plots.  The 22 plots for\nwhich  the  assessee found purchasers were conveyed  to	 the\nrespective purchasers and the 23rd plot was conveyed to	 the\nassesses  himself.  Mr. A. V. George and the  Kailas  Rubber\nCo. Ltd. were parties to this document.	 The plot which	 the\nassessee  had  retained	 for himself  was  104.13  acres  in\nextent.	  Its value was estimated by the Income Tax  Officer\nat  Rs.	 2,08,000.  The Income Tax Officer  worked  out	 the\nprofit from the transaction of purchase and sale of land  as\nfollows\n\"Sale price of 373 acres		Rs.   5,18,500\nValue of 104 acres retained by\nthe assessee at Rs. 2,000 per acre	   Rs. 2,08,000\n				   \n					  Rs. 7,26,500\n Less Cost				  Rs. 6,00,000\n				     \n					  Rs. 1,26,500\nThe  Income Tax Officer held that a sum of Rs.	1,25,000  in\nround  figures	represented the assessee&apos;s  profit  from  an\nadventure in the nature of trade and included this amount in\nhis  total  income under section 34(1)(a) of the  Act.	 The\nassessee  appealed to the Appellate  Assistant	Commissioner\nwho  rejected the appeal.  The assessee took the  matter  in\nfurther appeal to the Appellate Tribunal which also rejected\nthe   appeal  holding  that  the  amount  of  Rs.   1,25,000\nrepresented profit from an adventure in the nature of trade.\nAt  the	 instance  of the assessee  the	 Appellate  Tribunal\nstated a case to the High Court on the following question of\nlaw\n	      \"Whether on the facts and in the circumstances\n	      of  the case, the transactions  constituted  a\n	      venture in the nature of trade and the surplus\n	      of Rs. 1,25,000 was assessable to tax\nBy its. judgment dated 10th October, 1966, the High Court of\nKerala answered the question in the affirmative and  against\nthe assessee.  This appeal is brought by special leave	from\nthe  judgment  of  the	High Court  of	Kerala,	 dated	10th\nOctober, 1966 in Income Tax Reference No, 18 of 1965,\n \nThe  question whether a transaction is an adventure  in	 the\nnature	of trade must be decided on a consideration  of	 all\nthe relevant facts and circumstances which are proved in the\nparticular case.  The answer to the question does not depend\nupon  the application of any abstract rifle or principle  or\nformula but must depend upon the total impression and effect\nof  all the relevant facts and circumstances established  in\nthe  particular	 case.	In. California Copper  Syndicate  v.\nHarris,(1) Lord Justice Clerk, observed\n	      \"It  is  quite  a well  settled  principle  in\n	      dealing with questions of assessment of income\n	      tax  that	 where	the  owner  of	an  ordinary\n	      investment chooses to realise it, and  obtains\n	      a	 greater  price for it	than  he  originally\n	      acquired	it  at	the enhanced  price  is	 not\n	      profit  assessable to income tax.	 But  it  is\n	      equally well established that enhanced  values\n	      obtained	from  realisation or  conversion  of\n	      securities may be so assessable where what  is\n	      done is not merely a realisation or change  of\n	      investment,  but an act done in what is  truly\n	      the  carrying  on,  or  carrying	out,  of   a\n	      business.	  What is the line  which  separates\n	      the  two classes of cases may be difficult  to\n	      define,  and  each  case	must  be  considered\n	      according	 to  its facts; the question  to  be\n	      determined  being-Is the sum of gain that	 has\n	      been  made  a  mere enhancement  of  value  by\n	      realising	 a security or is it a gain made  in\n	      the  operation of business in carrying  out  a\n	      scheme for profit making ?\"\nBut  in judging the character of such  transactions  several\nfactors	 have been treated as significant in decided  cases.\nFor instance, if a transaction related to the business which\nis normally carried on by the assessee, though not  directly\na  part of it, an intention to launch upon an  adventure  in\nthe  nature  of trade may readily be  inferred.	  A  similar\ninference  would  arise where a commodity is  purchased	 and\nsub-divided,  altered,	treated or repaired and sold  or  is\nconverted  into	 a different commodity and then	 sold.	 The\nmagnitude of the transaction of purchase, the nature of	 the\ncommodity,  the	 subsequent dealings of	 the  assessee,	 the\nnature of the Organisation employed by the assessee and	 the\nmanner of disposal may be such that, the transaction may  be\nstamped	 with the character of a trading nature.  In  Martin\nv.  Lowry, (2) the assessee purchased a large  quantity of\naeroplane  linen and sold it in different lots, and for	 the\npurpose of  selling it started	an  advertising	 campaign,\nrented	offices	  engaged an advertising  manager,  a  linen\nexpert	and  a	staff of clerks.  maintained  account  books\nnormally used by a trader, and passed receipts add payment\n(1) [1904] 5 S.T.C. 159,16-66.\n(2) 11 Tax Cases 297.\n \nin  connection	with the linen through	a  separate  banking\naccount.,  It  was  held that the  assessee  carried  on  an\nadventure  in  the  nature of trade and so  the	 profit	 was\nliable to be taxed.  The same view was taken in Rutledge  v.\nCommissioners of Inland Revenue(1) in regard to an  assessee\nwho  purchased very cheaply a vast quantity of toilet  paper\nand   within  a	 short	time  thereafter  sold	 the   whole\nconsignment   at  a  considerable  profit.   Similarly,	  in\nCommissioner of Inland Revenue v. Fraser (2) the assessee, a\nwoodcutter,  bought  for resale, whisky in  bond,  in  three\n&apos;lots.	 He  sold it later on at considerable  profit.	 The\nassessee had never dealt in whisky before, he had no special\nknowledge  of  the  trade he did not take  delivery  of	 the\nwhisky	nor did he have it blended and advertised.  Even  so\nit  was	 held that the transaction was an adventure  in	 the\nnature	of  trade.  Lord President Normand observed  in	 the\ncourse of the judgment :\n	      \"It  is  in general more easy to hold  that  a\n	      single   transaction   entered  into   by	  an\n	      individual  in  the  line	 of  his  own  trade\n	      (although not part and parcel of his  ordinary\n	      business)	 is  an adventure in the  nature  of\n	      trade than to hold that a transaction  entered\n	      into by an individual outside the line of	 his\n	      own trade or occupation is an adventure in the\n	      nature of trade.	But what is a good deal more\n	      important	 is  the nature of  the	 transaction\n	      with reference to the commodity dealt in.	 The\n	      individual  who enters into a purchase  of  an\n	      article  or  commodity may have  in  view	 the\n	      resale  of it at a profit, and yet it  may  be\n	      that  is	not the only purpose  for  which  he\n	      purchased	 the article of the  commodity,	 nor\n	      the only purpose to which he might turn it  if\n	      favourable opportunity of sale does not occur.\n	      In some of the cases the purchase of a picture\n	      has been given as an illustration.  An amateur\n	      may  purchase  a picture with a  view  to	 its\n	      resale  at a profit, and yet he may  recognise\n	      at the time or afterwards that the  possession\n	      of   the	picture	 will  give  him   aesthetic\n	      enjoyment	 if he is unable ultimately,  or  at\n	      his chosen time, to realise it at a profit.  A\n	      man may purchase stocks and shares with a view\n	      to selling them at an early date at a  profit,\n	      but, if he does so, he is purchasing something\n	      which  is	 itself an investment,	a  potential\n	      source of revenue to him while he holds it.  A\n	      man may purchase land with a view to realising\n	      it  at a profit, but it also may yield him  an\n	      income  while he continues to hold it.  If  he\n	      continues	 to  hold it, there may	 be  also  a\n	      certain pride of possession But the  purchaser\n	      of  a  large  quantity  of  a  commodity	like\n	      whisky,  greatly	in excess of what  could  be\n	      used by\n	      (1) 14Tax Cases490.\n	      (2) 24 Tax Cases 498.\n \n	      himself,	his family and friends, a  commodity\n	      which  yields  no pride of  possession,  which\n	      cannot  be  turned  to account  except  by.  a\n	      process	of  realisation,  I   can   scarcely\n	      consider	to be other than an adventure  in  a\n	      transaction  in the nature of a trade;  and  I\n	      can find no single fact among those stated  by\n	      the  Commissioners which in any way  traverses\n	      that  view.  In my opinion, the fact that	 the\n	      transaction  was	not in the way	of  business\n	      (whatever it was) of the respondent in no	 way\n	      alters the character which almost	 necessarily\n	      belongs to a transaction like this\".\nThese are cases of commercial commodities but a	 transaction\nof purchase of land cannot be assumed without more to be  an\nadventure in the nature of trade.  In Leeming v. Jones,(1) a\nsyndicate  was	formed to acquire an option  over  a  rubber\nestate with a view to resell it at a profit, and finding the\nestate	too small the syndicate acquired another estate	 and\nsold  the  two	estates on profit.  It	was  held  that	 the\ntransaction  was not in the nature of trade and	 the  profit\nwas  not  liable to be assessed to tax.	 The same  view	 was\nexpressed in Saroj Kumar Mazumdar v. Commissioner of  Income\nTax  (2)  in which the assessee who carried on	business  of\nengineering   works   purchased	 land,	 which	 was   under\nrequisition by the Government, negotiated a sale before	 the\nland  was  de-requisitioned and sold it after the  land	 was\nreleased.   But the circumstances of a particular  case	 may\nlead to the conclusion that the purchaser resale of land  is\nin  the	 nature of trade.  In Venkataswami Naidu  &amp;  Co.  v.\nCommissioner of Income Tax(3) the appellant firm which acted\nas  managing agents purchas  the appellant was assessed for the assessment year 1956-57 on a total income of Rs. 8,400. The Income Tax Officer later on came to know that the assessee\'s income from the sale of estates had escaped assessment. The Income Tax Officer took action under section 34(1) (a) of the Income Tax Act, 1922 for the assessment year 1956-57 on 13th August, 1959. Under an agreement dated 18th May, 1955 a company called Mundakayam Valley Rubber Co. Ltd. sold and delivered an estate called Kuttikal Estate to one Mr. A. V. George. The area of the estate was 477 acres and 71 cents. Mr. A. V. George had entered into the agreement in his own name and on behalf of another company called the Kailas Rubber Co. Ltd.

The assessee subsequently divided the area of 477.71 acres into 23 plots and found purchasers for 22 of these, plots. The total extent of 22 plots for which he found purchasers was 373.58 acres and the total price paid by the 22 purchasers was Rs. 5,18,500. A sale deed was executed by the Mundakayam Valley Rubber Co. Ltd. on 31st March, 1956. It covered all the 23 plots. The 22 plots for which the assessee found purchasers were conveyed to the respective purchasers and the 23rd plot was conveyed to the assesses himself. Mr. A. V. George and the Kailas Rubber Co. Ltd. were parties to this document. The plot which the assessee had retained for himself was 104.13 acres in extent. Its value was estimated by the Income Tax Officer at Rs. 2,08,000. \r\nheld: he Income-tax authorities have correctly estimated the profit of the assessee by treating the land as stock-in-trade and valuing it according to the normal accountancy practice. \r\nappeal dismissed ','Bakhshish Singh Vs Union Of India (Uoi) And Ors. JUDGMENT\n  \n\nO. Chinnappa Reddy, J.\n \n\n1. Bakhshish Singh, the appellant, was appointed an Assistant in the Punjab Civil Secretariat on December 7, 1948 and was confirmed on September 1, 1956. Manohar Singh, Sardar Singh, D. Justin and Prithipal Singh Chawala, respondents 3 to 6 were also Assistants in &apos;. the Punjab Civil Secretariat, but were junior to the appellant. All of them were working as Assistants on November 1, 1956 when consequent on the State&apos;s Reorganisation Act, the former States of Punjab and PEPSU were merged into one State. On merger the conditions of service of those employed by the former States of Punjab and PEPSU were protected as provided by Sections 115(7) and 117 of the State&apos;s Reorganisation Act. The rules in force at that time, which governed them, were the Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Services Class III) Rules, 1952. Rule 6(1)(b) provided that posts of Superintendents, Records in the service were to be filled by selection among Assistants. Posts of Assistants-in-charge were to be filled (i) by promotion of Assistants; or (ii) by transfer or deputation of an official already in Government service. Rule 6 (1) (c) provided that posts of Assistants-in-charge were to be filled (i) by promotion of Assistants; or (ii) by transfer or deputation of an official already in Government service. Rule 6(I)(d) provided that the post of Superintendent, Military Secretary to Governor&apos;s office was to be filled by selection amongst\n Assistant. In October, 1963, the posts of Superintendents were made class II posts and came to be governed by the Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Service Class II) Rules. Rule 8(1)(a) provided that posts of Superintendents other than the Superintendent in the Press Branch were to be made (i) by promotion from amongst Deputy Superintendents, Assistants-in-charge and Assistants, who are members of the Punjab Civil Secretariat\n (State Service Class III) with minimum experience of one year as Deputy Superintendent or a total experience of 10 years as an Assistant; or (ii) by direct recruitment or by transfer or deputation of an official already in Government service holding a ministerial post. We are not concerned with the proviso to Rule 8(I)(a). Rule 8(I)(b) dealt with the post of Superintendent, Press Branch with which also we are not concerned. While this was so, as an experimental measure some posts of Assistant Section Officers were created which were not posts which belonged either to the Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Services Class III) or Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Services Class II). Appointment\n to these posts were to be made from Assistants belonging to the Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Services Class III) on the basis of an examination to be held by the Public Service Commission. Respondents 3 to 6 were selected and appointed as Assistant Section Officers as they were successful in the examination. The appellant either did not appear at the examination or was not successful at the examination. Therefore, he continued as Assistant in the Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Service Class III). By an order dated March 14, 1961, the Government expressly provided that the seniority of those appointed as Assistant Section Officers in their normal lines as Assistants will remain unchanged and that their promotion as Deputy Superintendents/Superintendents will be governed by their seniority as Assistants. Even so some Assistant Section Officers were promoted as Superintendents without reference to their seniority as Assistants. The promotions were quashed by the Punjab High Court in Roshan Lal Sharma&apos;s 1966 Ct. L J. 848 case. The State of Punjab thereupon thought fit to amend the Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Services Class II) by introducing a new Rule 8(I)(a)(i) in the place of the old Rule 8(I)(a)(i) which was as follows :-\n (i) By promotion from amongst Assistant Section Officers and such Deputy Superintendents, Assistants-in-charge and Assistants as are member of the Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Service Class III) with minimum experience of one year as a Deputy Superintendent or a total experience of ten years as an Assistant. \n \n\nTwo explanations were added and Explanation II provided that the number of posts of Superintendent and Section Officers available for promotion from amongst\n Assistant Section Officers shall bear the some proportion to the total number of such posts as the branch manned by Assistant Section Officers and Section Officers bear to the number of branches manned by Assistants and Superintendents, the method of promotion to vacancies available in such proportion being that persons, other than the Assistant Section Officers shall be promoted first and the Assistant Section Officers shall be promoted thereafter and so on. The Government of Punjab thought it advisable to obtain the approval of the Central Government as the High Court in Roshan Lal Sharma&apos;s case had said that the promotion of Assistant Section Officers to the posts of Superintendents based on their seniority as Assistant Section Officers was violative of the guarantees given by the State&apos;s Reorganisation Act. After seeking some clarification from the State Government, the Government of India wrote to the State Government as follows : -\n \n \n\nNo. 17/57/66-SR (S)\n \n\nGovernment of India/Ministry of Home Affairs.\n \n\nTo \n\nThe Chief Secretary to Government of Punjab, Secretariat Administration, Chandigarh.\n \n\nNew Delhi-1, the 20th May, 1967.\n \n\nSub : Integration of Services in Punjab-Rules for promotion to the post of Superintendent-Provision for promotion of Assistant Section Officers-Approval of the Central Government under the S.R.

In view of the fact that under the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, retrospective approval cann  Service- state of administration - Sections 115 and 117 of States Reorganization Act, 1956 and Rules 6 (I) and 8 (I) of Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Service Class III) Rules,1952 - claim against expulsion of request of testing advancement of respondents - respondents were junior to appellants - litigant fought ensure given to litigant by Sections115 (7) and 117 abused if there should be an occurrence of making of posts of Assistant Section Officers and by arrangement of advancement to posts of Superintendent in Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Service Class II) - making of new posts outside Class III administration and making people holding those posts qualified for advancement decreased odds of advancement of Assistants having a place with Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Service Class III) - there was no repudiation of Section 115 (7) - there was no adjustment in states of administration - respondents were youngsters to appealing party in framework of Assistants - appealing party did not profit himself of chance stood to him to qualify himself as Assistant Section Officer by passing recommended examination - appealing party can\'t be heard to whine that the individuals who were youngsters to him as Assistant have stolen walk over him - offer expelled. ','Priya Vasant Kalgutkar Vs Murad Shaikh &amp; Ors S.B. Sinha, J.\n\n\n1.    Leave granted.\n\n\n2.    Appellant is a young girl. She met with an accident on or about\n\n20.9.1999 while she was aged only 9 years. In the said accident she suffered\n\nthe following injuries, as stated in the application filed on her behalf before\n\nthe Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal :\n\n\n             1.     There is swelling deformity &amp; fracture of\n                    middle 3rd of Lt. thigh (femur shaft).\n             2.     Abrasion over left frontal region.\n \n\n             3.     Abrasion over Rt. Lateral aspect.\"\n\n\n3.    She was treated by two doctors. According to one of them, namely,\n\nDr. Mukund, who examined himself as PW3, she suffered 10% to 15% of\n\ndisability whereas according to the other doctor, Dr. Shivanand, she suffered\n\n20% to 25% of physical disability in her left lower limb.\n\n\n      An amount of Rs.3,00,000/- was claimed by her by way of\n\ncompensation in the claim petition before the Motor Accidents Claims\n\nTribunal under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereinafter\n\ncalled and referred to for the sake of brevity as `the Act&apos;). The Tribunal,\n\nhowever, having regard to the evidences brought on record, opining that\n\npermanent disability suffered by her would be 10%, a sum of Rs.40,000/-\n\nawarded on the said ground. The total amount of compensation determined\n\nwas a sum of Rs.72,785/- details of which are as under :\n\n\n                   \"Rs.18,000/- towards pain and sufferings\n             and agony, Rs. 12,460 towards diet and attendant\n             charges and Rs.323/- were awarded towards\n             medical expenses.\"\n\n\n4.    On an appeal preferred thereagainst, the High Court, without\n\nassigning any reason, enhanced the amount of compensation to\n\nRs.1,12,000/-, stating :\n \n\n            \"Petitioner could be awarded Rs.30,000/- for pain\n            and agony, Rs.10,000/- for medical and incidental\n            expenses relating to treatment, Rs.15,000/- for loss\n            of amenities and discomfort on account of\n            disability, Rs.27,000/- (1500 X 18) for loss of\n            future earnings on account of disability and\n            Rs.20,000/- for loss of marriage prospects on\n            account of disability. In all, the petitioner is\n            entitled to the compensation of Rs.1,12,000/- as\n            against Rs.72,785/- awarded by the Tribunal. On\n            the enhanced compensation, the interest payable\n            shall be 6% p.a. from the date of petition till\n            payment.\"\n\n\n5.    Appellant being aggrieved by and dissatisfied therewith is before us.\n\n\n6.    Mr. P.V.V. Shetty, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\nappellant, would contend that the High Court committed a serious error in\n\nawarding only a sum of Rs.1,12,000/- without taking into consideration her\n\nprospect of marriage. The amount of compensation on the basis of notional\n\nincome should not have been determined, urging that even if she was to\n\nwork as a labourer, she would have earned at Rs.4,000/- per month.\n\n\n7.    Indisputably, she was a child at that time. She had no earning. What\n\namount could be awarded towards future loss of earning or prospective loss\n\nof earning could not have been determined on the basis of any legal\n\nprinciple. Compensation for the injuries suffered by a person in a motor\n\nvehicle accident can be determined either on the basis of the actual damages\n\nsuffered or upon application of the structured formula. Although for the\n \n\npurpose of invoking the provisions of Section 163A of the Act, a legal\n\nprinciple may be found in the Second Schedule thereof.           The Second\n\nSchedule provides that where no income is proved, notional income for the\n\npurpose of payment of compensation to those who had no income prior to\n\naccident, a sum of Rs.15,000/- per annum would be considered as the\n\nmultiplicand. The multiplier which was required to be applied would be 15.\n\nParagraph 4 and 5 of the said Schedule reads as under :\n\n\n            \"4. General damages in case of injuries and\n            disabilities--\n            (i)    Pain and sufferings :\n                   (a) Grievous injuries\n                                                      Rs.5,000\n                   (b) Non-grievous injuries          Rs.1,000\n            (ii)   Medical expenses--actual expenses\n                   Incurred supported by bills/vouchers\n                   But not exceeding as onetime\n                   Payment                            Rs.15,000\n            5.

All the petitioners, in these three Writ Petitions filed under  Article\r\n    32 of the Constitution of India, are similarly situated. After  getting\r\n    the requisite training they have acquired the nomenclature of  \'trained\r\n    teachers\'. They  seek  an  appointments  in  the  schools  run  by  the\r\n    Respondent-State of Jharkhand as assistant teachers. Some IAs filed  by\r\n    several similarly situated teachers for  impleadment  and  seeking  the\r\n    same relief. It is for this reason that these petitions were conjointly\r\n    heard.\r\n 2. The exact prayer, contained in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 173  of  2010,\r\n    would give a glimpse of  the  nature  of  the  case  set  up  by  these\r\n    petitioners and the precise relief which these  petitioners  pray  for.\r\n    This prayer reads as under:\r\n               It is, therefore, respectfully prayed that Your  Lordships  may\r\n            graciously be pleased to:\r\n\r\n\r\n               i) Issue a writ, order or direction directing the respondents\r\n                  more particularly Respondent Nos. 1 to 3  to  appoint  the\r\n                  petitioners and similarly circumstanced  Trained  Teachers\r\n                  in order of seniority.\r\n\r\n\r\n              ii) Issue a writ, order or direction directing the respondents\r\n                  and more particularly the State of  Jharkhand  (Respondent\r\n                  Nos. 1 to 3)  to  protect  fundamental  right  of  Primary\r\n                  Education  to  the  children  of  State  of  Jharkhand  by\r\n                  appointing the Trained Teachers available in the Jharkhand\r\n                  State  on  the  sanctioned  vacant  posts   of   Assistant\r\n                  Teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n             iii) Pass such other or orders as this Honourable Court  may  deem\r\n                  fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of the  case\r\n                  and in the interests of justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  The background in which these petitions have come  to  be\r\n     filed is somewhat detailed one with chequered  history,  riddled  with\r\n     previous litigation  benefit  whereof  the  petitioners  are  seeking.\r\n     However, we would endeavour to traverse through  these  events  in  as\r\n     simple a manner as possible.\r\n     3.     As is well known, the State of Jharkhand  was  created  in  the\r\n     year 2000. Before that it was a part of the State of Bihar. All  these\r\n     petitioners belong to undivided Bihar vintage. They  claim  that  they\r\n     are  qualified   and   trained   teachers   who   acquired   requisite\r\n     qualification  and  underwent  necessary  training  and  thus   became\r\n     eligible to be considered for appointment as primary teachers  in  the\r\n     schools run by the State Government  as  per  the  provisions  of  the\r\n     Extant Rules on the subject. However, even  when  the  Government  was\r\n     legally bound to appoint only the trained teachers, on the basis of an\r\n     advertisement issued on 6.10.1991  by  the  Government  of  Bihar  for\r\n     filling up of 25,000 posts of Assistant Teachers, the State  recruited\r\n     17,281  untrained  teachers  out  of  total  appointments  of   19,272\r\n     Assistant  Teachers  made  in  the  said  recruitment  process.   This\r\n     selection was challenged by some persons by filing  writ  petition  in\r\n     the High Court of Judicature at Patna which was decided on  26.9.1996.\r\n     The High Court did not quash the appointments already made, though  at\r\n     the same time it held that the State  would  not  force  a  person  to\r\n     confine his application to a particular district. Against this  order,\r\n     Special Leave Petition No. 23187 of 1996  was  preferred  before  this\r\n     Court. In those proceedings an affidavit dated 14.8.1997 was filed  by\r\n     the Deputy Superintendent of Education, Bihar Government  agreeing  to\r\n     appoint trained teacher against existing vacancies. Having  regard  to\r\n     the averments made in the said affidavit, SLP  was  disposed  of  vide\r\n     order dated 5.9.1997. This case is known as Ram Vinay Kumar &amp; Ors.  v.\r\n     State of Bihar and  Ors.  (1998)  9  SCC  227.  The  exact  directions\r\n     regarding appointment to the post of  Assistant  Teachers  which  were\r\n     given by this Court are the following:\r\n              (i)  The Commission shall conduct a special selection  for  the\r\n           purpose of appointment of  these  unfilled  posts  from  amongst\r\n           applicants who had submitted their applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n           (ii)  The selection shall be confined to  applicants  possessing\r\n           teacher\'s  training/  qualification  obtained  from  government/\r\n           private teacher\'s training institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n           (iii) The selection shall be made by holding a preliminary  test\r\n           and a written examination of the candidates who qualify  in  the\r\n           preliminary test.\r\n\r\n\r\n       iv) In case the number of persons found suitable for appointment  in\r\n           such special selection exceeds the number  of  posts  for  which\r\n           recruitment was to be made on the basis of  advertisement  dated\r\n           6.10.1991, the surplus number of candidates who have been  found\r\n           suitable for the appointment would be justified against posts to\r\n           be filled on the basis of subsequent selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        v) The special selection which is to be conducted in  pursuance  of\r\n           these  directions  shall  be  completed  by  the  Commission  by\r\n           31.1.1997.   \r\n\r\n\r\n  4. In nut-shell, the direction was to conduct  a  special  selection  for\r\n     filling up of the unfilled posts from amongst the applicants  who  had\r\n     already submitted their applications  pursuant  to  the  advertisement\r\n     issued and it  was  to  be  confined  to  those  applicants  who  were\r\n     possessing teachers training/ qualification obtained from  Government/\r\n     private teachers\' training institution i.e. from amongst  the  trained\r\n     teachers. As per the petitioners as  on  30.9.1993  there  were  about\r\n     45,000 vacancies in as much as against total post of 2,09,981,  number\r\n     of teachers working were 1,54,751. Furthermore, in  next  three  years\r\n     about 18,431 teachers were expected to  retire.  Therefore,  projected\r\n     vacancies were approximately 63,000. On the creation of the  State  of\r\n     Jharkhand in terms of Bihar  Reorganisation  Act,  2000  proportionate\r\n     vacancies i.e. one-third came to the share of State of Jharkhand which\r\n     would mean that 21,000 vacancies were available on the date  on  which\r\n     this State was created.\r\n     5.     It is stated by the petitioners that for almost  7  years  from\r\n     the date of directions given in Ram Vinay Kumar\'s Case, no action  was\r\n     taken. It forced certain sections of trained teachers to approach  the\r\n     Patna High Court by way of several  Writ  Petitions.  All  these  Writ\r\n     Petitions were heard together with leading case known as Nand  Kishore\r\n     Ojha &amp; Ors. v. State of Bihar and Ors. (CWJC 13246/2003).  These  Writ\r\n     Petitions were allowed by the Patna High  Court  vide  judgment  dated\r\n     1.7.2004. In the said judgment it was inter alia noted that there were\r\n     number of unfilled vacancies because of  which  primary  schools  were\r\n     lying empty. The High Court deprecated the inaction on the part of the\r\n     Government of Bihar in not implementing the judgment of this Court  in\r\n     Ram Vinay Kumar\'s Case, on one pretext or the other, thereby  creating\r\n     a human rights problem in denying a  young  generation  its  right  to\r\n     basic education. According to the High Court, the solution was  simple\r\n     viz. to follow the judgment of this Court in Ram  Vinay  Kumar\'s  case\r\n     from where the circumstances has been left out. The  High  Court  also\r\n     calculated the number of existing  vacancies  in  the  manner  already\r\n     pointed out above.  On this basis direction was given to carry out the\r\n     selection process as per the mandate of this Court  contained  in  the\r\n     case of Ram Vinay Kumar.\r\n     6.     The State of Bihar challenged the aforesaid  judgment  of  High\r\n     Court by filing  Special  Leave  Petitions  in  this  Court.  However,\r\n     thereafter affidavit dated 18.1.2006 was filed by the Commissioner-cum-\r\n     Secretary, Education Department,  Government  of  Bihar  alongwith  an\r\n     application for withdrawal of those Special Leave  Petitions.  In  the\r\n     affidavit an undertaking was given that  only  trained  teachers  were\r\n     appointed as Assistant teachers in the State of Bihar.  Further  owing\r\n     to the reason that the number of available teachers in  the  State  of\r\n     Bihar were less than the available sanctioned post  and  no  test  for\r\n     selection was required. On the basis of this affidavit,  orders  dated\r\n     23.1.2006 were  passed  permitting  the  Government  to  withdraw  the\r\n     Special Leave Petitions.\r\n     7.     When the undertaking  given  in  the  said  affidavit  was  not\r\n     implemented  immediately  thereafter,  some  persons  filed   Contempt\r\n     Petition No. 207 of 2006 in this Court which was disposed of by orders\r\n     dated 19.3.2007 with a direction to the State of  Bihar  to  implement\r\n     its undertaking.\r\n            Operative part of the said order reads as under:\r\n              In paragraph 17 of the said affidavit in reply dated  7.2.2007,\r\n           it is stated that priority has been given to trained teachers in\r\n           appointment and only if trained teachers are  not  available  in\r\n           sufficient  numbers,  the  case  of   untrained   teachers   are\r\n           considered by the concerned  by  the  Panchayati  Raj  Institute\r\n           (PRI) to achieve the constitutional goal of free and  compulsory\r\n           education for children from age 6-14, and  in  this  regard  the\r\n           State of Bihar and other  answering  respondents  are  complying\r\n           with the orders of the High Court and  also  of  this  Court.  A\r\n           rejoinder has also been filed by the  petitioner  disputing  the\r\n           statements made by the State of Bihar  in  the  affidavit  dated\r\n           7.2.2007.\r\n                 In view of the categorical statement  now  made  that  the\r\n           priority will be given to the trained  teachers  in  appointment\r\n           and also the clarification made  in  paragraphs  19  to  222  of\r\n           aforesaid affidavit dated 7.2.2007, we direct the State of Bihar\r\n           to implement the undertaking given by the State of Bihar earlier\r\n           and also now by the present affidavit dated 7.2.2007  in  letter\r\n           and spirit by appointing the trained teachers on priority basis.\r\n                 The Contempt Petition is disposed of accordingly.   \r\n\r\n\r\n     8.     Still this undertaking was  not  complied  with  which  led  to\r\n     filing of another Contempt  Petition  No.  297  of  2007  titled  Nand\r\n     Kishore Ojha v. Anjani Kumar Singh  in which following interim  orders\r\n     dated 9.12.2009 were passed.\r\n              Accordingly, without issuing a Rule of Contempt, we direct that\r\n           the 34,540 vacancies shown as  available  in  the  advertisement\r\n           published in December, 2003,  be  filled  up  from  amongst  the\r\n           trained teachers who are available, in order  of  seniority.  As\r\n           indicated above, this is to be done on a one-time basis and must\r\n           not be taken as the regular practice to be followed.\r\n           Let the Contempt Petition be adjourned for a further  period  of\r\n           six weeks to enable the State Government to implement this order\r\n           and to submit a report on the next date as to the result of  the\r\n           discussions  held  between  the  petitioner  and  the  concerned\r\n           authorities.   \r\n\r\n\r\n     9.     Thereafter, the State of Bihar filled up  the  vacant  post  of\r\n     Assistant Teachers in terms of its undertaking thereby recruiting from\r\n     amongst the trained teachers who had applied earlier, pursuant to  the\r\n     advertisement given in the year 1991. Many had become over aged in the\r\n     meantime, and age relaxation was given in their cases.\r\n     10.    What is narrated above is the  history  of  litigation  in  the\r\n     State of  Bihar.  In  so  far  as  State  of  Jharkhand  is  concerned\r\n     (respondent herein),  as  already  pointed  out  above,  approximately\r\n     21,000 vacant post were transferred  to  this  State.  The  respondent\r\n     advertised these vacancies in the year 2002 by  giving  relaxation  in\r\n     age by 5 years only. Because of this reason many trained teachers,  in\r\n     which category of the petitioners include, could not be  appointed  as\r\n     Assistant Teachers, being overage. The petitioners, in this  backdrop,\r\n     contend that they are entitled to the benefit  of  Ram  Vinay  Kumar\'s\r\n     judgment of this Court  rendered  much  before  the  creation  of  the\r\n     Jharkhand State and applied to the erstwhile  unified  Bihar  and  the\r\n     judgment be implemented in their case as well as it has  happened  qua\r\n     the trained teachers in State of Bihar in the manner explained  above.\r\n     We may point out  at  this  stage  that  respondent  State  is  making\r\n     appointment only from amongst trained teachers. The problem,  however,\r\n     has arisen because fo the reason that these  petitioners  have  become\r\n     over aged and wanted total age relaxation. To put it, succinctly  they\r\n     are claiming parity with their counterparts in the State of Bihar  and\r\n     submitting that when those  teachers  were  appointed  by  giving  age\r\n     relaxation, there is no reason to deprive  the  petitioners  from  the\r\n     same treatment which would, otherwise, be discriminatory and violative\r\n     of Article 14 of the Constitution.\r\n     11.    The petitioners have pointed out that the respondent-State  had\r\n     set up a Committee in the year 2001 for implementation of the judgment\r\n     and even the said Committee in its report dated 31.5.2001  recommended\r\n     that all vacancies in the State of Jharkhand be  filled  with  trained\r\n     teachers  within  two  months.  The  operative  portion  of  the  said\r\n     recommendation reads as under:\r\n              Since the Government at its own  level  have  imparted  teacher\r\n           training to the thousands and the trained teachers were  in  the\r\n           hope for the two decades  that  they  will  be  appointed  as  a\r\n           teacher.  It  is  totally  unjustified  and  in-human  that  the\r\n           Government appoints untrained persons  and  thereby  ruined  the\r\n           future of trained teachers. Therefore,  the  committee  here  by\r\n           recommends that all the vacancies in the State of  Jharkhand  be\r\n           fulfill with trained teachers within  2  months.  If  number  of\r\n           trained teachers exceeds  the  number  of  vacancies,  then  the\r\n           vacancies be fulfilled on the basis of seniority of the  trained\r\n           teachers  i.e.  in  the  order  of   their   getting   training.\r\n           Thereafter,  the  trained  teachers   remained   unemployed   be\r\n           appointed  against  subsequent  vacancies.  In  the  appointment\r\n           process the  All the petitioners, in the Writ Petitions filed under&nbsp;Article 32&nbsp;of the Constitution of India, are similarly situated. After getting the requisite training they have acquired the nomenclature of \'trained teachers\'. They seek an appointments in the schools run by the Respondent-State of Jharkhand as assistant teachers. Some IAs filed by several similarly situated teachers for impleadment and seeking the same relief. It is for this reason that these petitions were conjointly heard.The direction was to conduct a special selection for filling up of the unfilled posts from amongst the applicants who had already submitted their applications pursuant to the advertisement issued and it was to be confined to those applicants who were possessing teachers training/ qualification obtained from Government/ private teachers\' training institution i.e. from amongst the trained teachers.&nbsp;The High Court deprecated the inaction on the part of the Government of Bihar in not implementing the judgment of this Court .The High Court also calculated the number of existing vacancies .The State of Bihar challenged the aforesaid judgment of High Court by filing Special Leave Petitions in this Court.Thereafter, the State of Bihar filled up the vacant post of Assistant Teachers in terms of its undertaking thereby recruiting from amongst the trained teachers who had applied earlier, pursuant to the advertisement given in the year 1991. Many had become over aged in the meantime, and age relaxation was given in their cases.Having regard to the above it would not be permissible to the petitioners to compare their case with their counterparts in Bihar. As far as the counterparts in the State of Bihar are concerned they had filed writ petitions well in time i.e. way back in the year 2003 in Patna High Court wherein those persons succeeded. The Patna High Court allowed those writ petitions vide judgment dated 1.7.2004 directing the State of Bihar to implement the judgment in Ram Vinay Kumar\'s Case. In such circumstances this Court would not be inclined to grant any relief to the petitioners in these petitions filed under&nbsp;Article 32&nbsp;of the Constitution, more so when it is found that the respondent/ State of Jharkhand has taken steps in conformity with the statutory recruitment rules framed under proviso to&nbsp;Article 309&nbsp;of the Constitution.Finding no merits in these writ petitions, same were dismissed. All pending I.As also stand dismissed. I.As Disposed','Punjab State Warehousing Corp Vs Bhushan Chander & Anr Dipak Misra, J.\r\n\r\n\r\n      The singular question that has emanated in  this  appeal,  by  special\r\nleave, is whether the High  Court  has  correctly  accepted  the  submission\r\nadvanced on behalf of the first respondent, who was convicted  for  offences\r\npunishable under Section 409/467/468/471 of  the  Indian  Penal  Code,  1860\r\n(for short,    IPC   ) and had been awarded sentence for each  of  the  offences\r\nwith the stipulation that they would run  concurrently,  that  he  being  an\r\nemployee of the appellant Corporation is a public servant and the trial  had\r\ncommenced without obtaining sanction  under  Section  197  of  the  Code  of\r\nCriminal Procedure, 1973  (CrPC)  and  hence,  the  trial  in  entirety  was\r\ninvalid and as a result the conviction  and  sentence  deserved  to  be  set\r\naside.\r\n2.    As far as the factual narration is  concerned,  suffice  it  to  state\r\nthat the Managing Director of  the  Corporation  had  written  a  letter  on\r\n28.6.1989 to the concerned police authority to register a case  against  the\r\nfirst respondent for offences punishable under Sections 409/467/468 and  471\r\nof  the  IPC  or  any  other   appropriate   provision   of   law.    During\r\ninvestigation, the investigating agency  found  that  the  accused  who  was\r\nworking as a Godown Assistant in  the  Corporation  had  misappropriated  11\r\ngunny bales value of which was Rs.38,841/-; that he had  tampered  with  the\r\nrecord of the department; and accordingly the police authorities  filed  the\r\ncharge-sheet for the  aforesaid  offences  before  the  court  of  competent\r\nJudicial Magistrate.  The  learned  Magistrate  on  the  basis  of  evidence\r\nbrought on record, found that the prosecution had been able  to  bring  home\r\nthe guilt against the  accused  and  accordingly  sentenced  him  to  suffer\r\nrigorous imprisonment for three years under Section 467 and 409 IPC and  two\r\nyears under Section 468/471 IPC with separate default clauses. The  judgment\r\nof conviction and order of  sentence  was  assailed  in  appeal  before  the\r\nlearned Session Judge, Firozpur and the matter  was  finally  heard  by  the\r\nlearned Additional Session Judge, who appreciating the evidence  on  record,\r\nconcurred with the conviction but  modified  the  sentence  of  three  years\r\nimposed under Section 409 and 467 IPC to two years.\r\n3.    Being dissatisfied, the first respondent preferred  Criminal  Revision\r\nNo. 359/2001 in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh.   Before\r\nthe revisional court, the only contention that was raised pertained to  non-\r\nobtaining of sanction under Section 197 CrPC.   It  was  argued  before  the\r\nlearned Single Judge that in view of the decisions in State  of  Maharashtra\r\nv. Dr. Budhikota Subbarao[1], Rakesh Kumar Mishra  v.  State  of  Bihar  and\r\nothers[2], Sankaran Moitra v. Sadhna Das and another[3],  Om  Kumar  Dhankar\r\nv. State of Haryana[4], the requisite sanction  having  not  been  obtained,\r\nthe trial was vitiated.  On behalf of the Corporation as well as  the  State\r\nof Punjab, it was argued that the sanction under Section 197  CrPC  was  not\r\nnecessary to prosecute the first respondent and  to  substantiate  the  said\r\nstand, reliance was  placed  on  Dr.  Lakshmansingh  Himatsingh  Vaghela  v.\r\nNaresh Kumar Chadrrashanker Jah[5], N. Bhargavan Pillai (dead) by  Lrs.  and\r\nanother v. State of Kerala[6],   State  of  U.P.  v.  Paras  Nath  Singh[7],\r\nRaghunath Anant Govilkar v. State of Maharashtra[8]  and  Choudhury  Parveen\r\nSultana v. State of West Bengal[9].\r\n4.    The learned Single Judge referred to the charges framed under  Section\r\n409 and 467 IPC.  He also referred  to  the  authorities  in  Prakash  Singh\r\nBadal v. State of Punjab[10], Nirmal Singh Kahlon v.  State  of  Punjab[11],\r\nOm Kumar Dhankar (supra) and Bakshish Singh  Brar  v.  Gurmel  Kaur[12]  and\r\nanalyzing Section 197 CrPC observed that the  said  provision  is  meant  to\r\nprotect responsible public servants against  the  institution  of  vexatious\r\ncriminal proceedings for offences alleged to have been  committed  by  them.\r\nThe learned Single Judge referred to P. Arulswami v.  State  of  Madras[13],\r\nMatajog Dube v.  H.C.  Bahri[14],  P.K.  Pradhan  v.  State  of  Sikkim[15],\r\nreproduced a passage from B. Saha v. M.S. Kochar[16], and came  to  hold  as\r\nfollows:-\r\n   So far as the commission of offence in this case  is  concerned,  the  very\r\nallegation would clearly reveal that it is not a case where the  allegations\r\nare in any other capacity than a public  servant.   The  allegation  against\r\nthe petitioner is that while being a public  servant,  he  had  committed  a\r\ncriminal breach of trust.  It is only in the  performance  of  the  official\r\nduty that the  petitioner  is  alleged  to  have  been  found  with  certain\r\ndeficiencies for which allegation of criminal breach of trust  as  well  has\r\nbeen made against him.  Certainly the facts in this  case  are  inextricably\r\nmingled with the official duty of the petitioner to be considered  severable\r\nto call for dispensing with the requirement of sanction   .\r\n\r\n5.    After so stating, the revisional court distinguished the  decision  in\r\nParas Nath Singh (supra)  which  was  relied  upon  by  the  prosecution  by\r\nstating thus:-\r\n   The aggrieved  person  in  the  said  case  has  faced  trial  for  alleged\r\ncommission of the offences punishable under Section 409, 420,  461  and  468\r\nIPC.  The Supreme Court in  this  case  has  drawn  difference  between  the\r\nofficial duty and doing something by public servant in  the  course  of  his\r\nservice.  It is observed that the section does  not  extend  its  protective\r\ncover to act or omission done by a public servant in service, but  restricts\r\nits scope of operation to only those acts or omissions, which are done by  a\r\npublic servant in discharge of official duty.  Even this observation of  the\r\nHon   ble Supreme Court would fully apply to the facts of  the  present  case.\r\nHere, the petitioner is alleged to have committed this offence not  only  as\r\na public servant but is stated to have done so in discharge of his  official\r\nduty.   In discharge of his official duty, the petitioner  was  required  to\r\nprotect stock, which he failed to do so and so he is asked  to  account  for\r\nthe same   .\r\n\r\n6.    The eventual conclusion recorded by the learned  Single  Judge  is  to\r\nthe following effect:-\r\n   Under normal circumstances, the offence under Sections 467/468/471 IPC  may\r\nbe of such a nature that requirement of  obtaining  sanction  under  Section\r\n197 CrPC may not be called for.  The offences in this case have been  inter-\r\nconnected with  the  main  offence  alleged  against  the  petitioner  under\r\nSection 409 IPC and it would clearly indicate that these offences could  not\r\nbe separately treated or dealt  with.   Requirement  of  obtaining  sanction\r\nwould be needed for an offence under Section 409 IPC and the  same  may  not\r\nbe separated from the remaining offences   .\r\n\r\n7.    After so stating, the learned Single Judge ruled that the  Corporation\r\nis a fully government-owned  and  financed  by  the  State  Government  and,\r\ntherefore, he is a public servant as per the definition  of  Section  21  of\r\nIPC and, therefore, his employment in the Corporation would confer  him  the\r\nstatus of public servant for which sanction is  necessary.   The  revisional\r\ncourt has not adverted to any of the aspects touching  merits  of  the  case\r\nand, therefore, we refrain from entering into the said arena.\r\n8.    Section 197(1) and  (2)  CrPC  which  are  relevant  for  the  present\r\npurpose are reproduced below:-\r\n   197. Prosecution of Judges and public servants.   (1) When any person who  is\r\nor was a Judge or Magistrate or a public  servant  not  removable  from  his\r\noffice save by or with the sanction of the  Government  is  accused  of  any\r\noffence alleged to have been committed by him while acting or purporting  to\r\nact in the discharge of his official duty, no court  shall  take  cognizance\r\nof such  offence  except  with  the  previous  sanction  save  as  otherwise\r\nprovided in the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013   \r\n\r\n(a) in the case of a person who is employed or, as the case may be,  was  at\r\nthe time of commission of the alleged offence employed, in  connection  with\r\nthe affairs of the Union, of the Central Government;\r\n\r\n(b) in the case of a person who is employed or, as the case may be,  was  at\r\nthe time of commission of the alleged offence employed, in  connection  with\r\nthe affairs of a State, of the State Government:\r\n\r\nProvided that where the alleged offence was committed by a  person  referred\r\nto in clause (b) during the period while a proclamation issued under  clause\r\n(1) of Article 356 of the Constitution was in force in a State,  clause  (b)\r\nwill apply as if for the expression    State  Government     occurring  therein,\r\nthe expression    Central Government    were substituted.\r\n\r\nExplanation.   For the removal  of  doubts  it  is  hereby  declared  that  no\r\nsanction shall be required in case  of  a  public  servant  accused  of  any\r\noffence alleged to have been committed under Section 166-A,  Section  166-B,\r\nSection 354, Section 354-A, Section 354-B,  Section  354-C,  Section  354-D,\r\nSection 370,  Section  375,  Section  376,  Section  376-A,  Section  376-C,\r\nSection 376-D or Section 509 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860).\r\n\r\n(2)   No Court shall take cognizance of any offence  alleged  to  have  been\r\ncommitted by any member of the Armed Forces of the  Union  while  acting  or\r\npurporting to act in the discharge of his official  duty,  except  with  the\r\nprevious sanction of the Central Government.   \r\n\r\n9.    In Matajog Dube (supra), certain complaints were alleged  against  the\r\nauthorized  officials  on  the  ground  that  the  officials  had  committed\r\noffences  punishable  under  Sections  323,  341,  342  and  109  IPC.   The\r\nofficials were arrayed as accused persons who were authorized to search  two\r\npremises in question.  The trial Magistrate discharged the  accused  persons\r\nfor want of sanction under Section 197 CrPC.  Similar order  was  passed  by\r\nanother trial Magistrate.  Both the orders were concurred with by  the  High\r\nCourt.  Be it noted two cases had arisen as two complaints were  filed.   It\r\nwas contended before  this  Court  that  the  act  of  criminal  assault  or\r\nwrongful confinement can never be regarded  as  act  done  while  acting  or\r\npurporting to act in the  discharge  of  official  duty  and  that  duty  is\r\nclearly defined in the statute.  The  Constitution  Bench  referred  to  two\r\ndecisions  of  the  Federal  Court  and  the  decisions  of  this  Court  in\r\nShreekantiah Ramayya Munipalli v. State of Bombay[17]  and  Amrik  Singh  v.\r\nState of Pepsu[18] and analyzing the earlier authorities opined that:-\r\n   The result of foregoing discussion is this:  There  must  be  a  reasonable\r\nconnection between the act and the discharge of official duty; the act  must\r\nbear such relation to the duty that the accused could lay a  reasonable  but\r\nnot a pretended or fanciful claim, that he did  it  in  the  course  of  the\r\nperformance of his duty   .\r\n\r\n10.   Thereafter, the  Court  adverted  to  the  determination  of  need  of\r\nsanction and the relevant  stage.   We  are  not  concerned  with  the  said\r\naspects in the present case.\r\n11.    In  Arulswami  (supra),  the  President  of  a  Panchayat  Board  was\r\nconvicted under Section 409 IPC by the High Court which had  overturned  the\r\ndecision of the lower court.  It was argued before the High Court  that  the\r\nprosecution  was  not  maintainable  for  want  of  sanction  by  the  State\r\nGovernment under Section 106 of the Madras Village Panchayats  Act   (Madras\r\nAct X of 1950).  The High Court held that no sanction of the Government  was\r\nnecessary as the appellant had ceased to hold the office of  the  President,\r\nwhen the prosecution was launched and  further  that  the  sanction  of  the\r\nCollector was sufficient in law.  That apart, this Court posed the  question\r\nwhether the sanction of the Government under Section 106 of the  Madras  Act\r\nwas necessary for the prosecution of the appellant  for  the  offence  under\r\nSection 409 IPC.  To appreciate the contention raised,  the  Court  referred\r\nto Section 197 CrPC.  The three-Judge Bench referred  to  the  decisions  in\r\nHori Ram Singh v. Emperor[19] and H.H.B. Gill v. The King[20].   The  three-\r\nJudge Bench quoted the observations of Lord  Simonds  made  in  H.H.B.  Gill\r\n(supra) in approving the statement of law made in Hori Ram  Singh   (supra).\r\nThe Court also took note of the  fact  that  the  decision  in  H.H.B.  Gill\r\n(supra) had been approved in Albert West Meads v.  The  King[21],  Phanindra\r\nChandra v. The King[22] and R. W. Mathams v. State of  West  Bengal[23]  and\r\neventually held:-\r\n   It is not therefore every  offence  committed  by  a  public  servant  that\r\nrequires sanction for prosecution under S. 197(1) of the Criminal  Procedure\r\nCode; nor even every act done by him while he is  actually  engaged  in  the\r\nperformance of his  official  duties;  but  if  the  act  complained  of  is\r\ndirectly concerned with his official  duties  so  that,  if  questioned,  it\r\ncould be claimed to have been done by virtue of the  office,  then  sanction\r\nwould be necessary.  It is the quality of the act that is important  and  if\r\nit falls within the scope and range of his official  duties  the  protection\r\ncontemplated by S. 197 of the Criminal Procedure  Code  will  be  attracted.\r\nAn office may be entirely unconnected with the official duty as such  or  it\r\nmay be committed within the  scope  of  the  official  duty.   Where  it  is\r\nunconnected with the official duty there can be no protection   .\r\n12.   The Court while arriving at the said conclusion also  placed  reliance\r\non Om Prakash Gupta v. State of U.P.[24] and ultimately came  to  hold  that\r\nthe sanction of the Government is  not  necessary  for  prosecution  of  the\r\naccused under Section 409 IPC.\r\n13.   The aforesaid two authorities  make  it  clear  that  no  sanction  is\r\nneeded to launch the prosecution for the offence  punishable  under  Section\r\n409 IPC.  As we notice from the impugned judgment, the learned Single  Judge\r\nhas been swayed away by what has been stated in B.  Saha  (supra).   In  the\r\nsaid  case,  the  appellants  had  sought  discharge  on  the  ground   that\r\ncognizance of the complaint had been taken without obtaining sanction  under\r\nSection 197 CrPC and Section 155 of the Customs Act, 1962.   The  Magistrate\r\nhad accepted the objection relying on the decision in  Shreekantiah  Ramayya\r\nMunipalli (supra).  The said order was challenged by the complainant  before\r\nthe High Court and the learned  Single  Judge,  after  elaborate  discussion\r\nopined that no sanction was required for the  prosecution  of  the  accused-\r\nappellants for the offence under Sections 120-B/409 IPC  because  they  were\r\ncertainly not acting in the discharge of their official  duties,  when  they\r\nmisappropriated the goods.  The three-Judge Bench analyzing  the  ambit  and\r\nscope of Section 197 CrPC opined that the  words     any  offence  alleged  to\r\nhave been committed by  him  while  acting  or  purporting  to  act  in  the\r\ndischarge of his official duty    employed in Section 197(1) of the Code,  are\r\ncapable of a narrow as well as a wide interpretation.   If  the  said  words\r\nare  construed  too  narrowly,  the  section  will  be  rendered  altogether\r\nsterile, for,    it is no part of an official duty to commit an  offence,  and\r\nnever can be   . The Court proceeded to observe that in the wider  sense,  the\r\nsaid words  will  take  under  their  umbrella  every  act  constituting  an\r\noffence, committed in the course  of  the  same  transaction  in  which  the\r\nofficial duty is performed  or  purports  to  be  performed  and  the  right\r\napproach to the import of these  words  lies  between  these  two  extremes.\r\nWhile on the one hand, it  is  not  every  offence  committed  by  a  public\r\nservant while engaged in the performance of  his  official  duty,  which  is\r\nentitled to the  protection  of  Section  197(1),  an  act  constituting  an\r\noffence, directly and reasonably  connected  with  his  official  duty  will\r\nrequire sanction for  prosecution  under  the  said  provision.   The  Court\r\nreferred to the observations of Ramaswami,  J.,  in  Baijnath  v.  State  of\r\nM.P.[25], which is to the following effect:-\r\n   it is the quality of the act that is important, and if it falls within  the\r\nscope and range of his  official  duties,  the  protection  contemplated  by\r\nSection 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code will be attracted   .\r\n\r\n      After  The Managing Director of the Corporation had written a letter on 28.6.1989 to the concerned police authority to register a case against the first respondent for offences punishable under&nbsp;Sections 409/467/468&nbsp;and&nbsp;471&nbsp;of the IPC or any other appropriate provision of law. During investigation, the investigating agency found that the accused who was working as a Godown Assistant in the Corporation had misappropriated 11 gunny bales value of which was Rs.38,841/-; that he had tampered with the record of the department; and accordingly the police authorities filed the charge-sheet for the aforesaid offences before the court of competent Judicial Magistrate. The learned Magistrate on the basis of evidence brought on record, found that the prosecution had been able to bring home the guilt against the accused and accordingly sentenced him to suffer rigorous imprisonment for three years under&nbsp;Section 467&nbsp;and&nbsp;409&nbsp;IPC and two years under&nbsp;Section 468/471&nbsp;IPC with separate default clauses. The judgment of conviction and order of sentence was assailed in appeal before the learned Session Judge, Firozpur and the matter was finally heard by the learned Additional Session Judge, who appreciating the evidence on record, concurred with the conviction but modified the sentence of three years imposed under&nbsp;Section 409&nbsp;and&nbsp;467&nbsp;IPC to two years.Being dissatisfied, the first respondent preferred Criminal Revision No. 359/2001 in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh. Before the revisional court, the only contention that was raised pertained to non- obtaining of sanction under&nbsp;Section 197&nbsp;CrPC.The Supreme Court in the case had drawn difference between the official duty and doing something by public servant in the course of his service.&nbsp;Here, the petitioner was alleged to have committed the offence not only as a public servant but was stated to have done so in discharge of his official duty. In discharge of his official duty, the petitioner was required to protect stock, which he failed to do so and so he was asked to account for the sameâ€.In view of the aforesaid analysis, the irresistible conclusion was that the respondents were not entitled to have the protective umbrella of&nbsp;Section 197&nbsp;CrPC and, therefore, the High Court has erred in setting aside the conviction and sentence on the ground that the trial is vitiated in the absence of sanction.

In this batch of cases the question which arises for\r\n\r\ndetermination       is:   whether    BSE    Membership           Card   can   be\r\n\r\nconsidered     an    intangible         asset   for        the    purpose      of\r\n\r\ndepreciation    under      Section      32(1)(ii)     of    the    Income     Tax\r\n\r\nAct, 1961 (for short \"the 1961 Act\")?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFacts in M/s Techno Shares &amp; Stocks Ltd. [Lead matter]\r\n\r\n3.    In this case, we are concerned with the Assessment\r\n\r\nYears 1999-2000, 2000-2001, 2001-2002 and 2002-2003. The\r\n\r\nassessee   company        filed   its    Return     of     income       for   the\r\n \r\n\r\nAssessment      Year    1999-2000         disclosing     a    loss      of    Rs.\r\n\r\n10,77,276/-. The return was processed under Section 143(1)\r\n\r\non November 8, 2000. The case stood reopened under Section\r\n\r\n147 and Notice u/s 148 stood issued to the assessee on\r\n\r\n16.7.2002. The assessee filed its return of income under\r\n\r\nprotest. The assessee filed its return of income pursuant\r\n\r\nto the Notice u/s 148 once again declaring loss of Rs.\r\n\r\n10,77,276/-, the same as was in the original return of\r\n\r\nincome. The main reason for reopening of assessment under\r\n\r\nSection 147 was the claim of depreciation by the assessee\r\n\r\non BSE membership card amounting to Rs. 23,65,000/-. The\r\n\r\nclaim of depreciation of the assessee was based on Section\r\n\r\n32(1)(ii) which stood inserted by Finance (No. 2) Act,\r\n\r\n1998 w.e.f. 1.4.1999. However, the said Section deals with\r\n\r\nclaim    for   depreciation          of   items   acquired    on       or    after\r\n\r\n1.4.1998.      The assessee claimed before the A.O. that the\r\n\r\nBSE     membership     card    is     a    \"licence\"     or   \"business         or\r\n\r\ncommercial right of similar nature\" u/s 32(1)(ii) and is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, an intangible asset eligible for depreciation\r\n\r\nu/s 32(1)(ii) which submission was not accepted by the\r\n\r\nA.O.      It   was   held     that    membership    is   only      a   personal\r\n\r\npermission which is non-transferable and which does not\r\n\r\ndevolve automatically on legal heirs and, therefore, it is\r\n \r\n\r\nnot a privately owned asset.               That, there is no ownership\r\n\r\nof an asset and that what ultimately can be sold is only a\r\n\r\nRight to Nomination.           Further, according to the A.O., in\r\n\r\nthe case of BSE membership, there is no obsolescence, wear\r\n\r\nand tear or diminution in value by its use, hence, the\r\n\r\nassessee     was   not     entitled        to    claim     depreciation            u/s\r\n\r\n32(1)(ii).     This decision of the A.O. stood affirmed by\r\n\r\nC.I.T. (A) in the appeal filed by the assessee.\r\n\r\n4.    Aggrieved      by    the      said    decision       of    CIT    (A),       the\r\n\r\nassessee   carried       the   matter      in    appeal    to    the        Tribunal\r\n\r\nwhich took the view that since the assessee had acquired a\r\n\r\nright to trade on the floor of BSE through the membership\r\n\r\ncard, it was not entitled to depreciation u/s 32(1)(ii) of\r\n\r\nthe 1961 Act.        That, the said Card is a capital asset\r\n\r\nthrough    which   right       to   trade       on   the   floor       of    BSE    is\r\n\r\nacquired     and   since       it   is     intangible       asset       the     said\r\n\r\nassessee was entitled to depreciation u/s 32(1)(ii).\r\n\r\n5.    Against the said decision, the Department carried\r\n\r\nthe matter in appeal to the High Court which came to the\r\n\r\nconclusion,    following        certain     decisions       of     this       Court,\r\n\r\nthat the BSE membership card is only a personal privilege\r\n\r\ngranted to a member to trade in shares on the floor of the\r\n\r\nStock Exchange; that, such a privilege cannot be equated\r\n \r\n\r\nwith the expression \"licence\" or \"any other business or\r\n\r\ncommercial rights of similar nature\" u/s 32(1)(ii); that,\r\n\r\nthere     is    a   difference       between    acquiring       a    know-how,\r\n\r\npatent, copyright or trademark and acquiring a licence to\r\n\r\nuse     such     know-how,     patent,     copyright,       trademark         or\r\n\r\nfranchise;       that   the   expression       \"business    or      commercial\r\n\r\nrights of similar nature\" in Section 32(1)(ii) of the 1961\r\n\r\nAct   would      take   its    colour    from    the    preceding         words,\r\n\r\nnamely,        know-how,      patent,    copyright,        trademark         and\r\n\r\nfranchise which belong to a class of intellectual property\r\n\r\nrights and applying the rule of ejusdem generis, the High\r\n\r\nCourt held that the expression \"licence\" as well as the\r\n\r\nexpression       \"business     and    commercial       rights       of   similar\r\n\r\nnature\" in Section 32(1)(ii) of the 1961 Act are referable\r\n\r\nto IPRs such as know-how, patent, copyright, trademark and\r\n\r\nfranchise and since the BSE membership card does not fall\r\n\r\nin any of the above categories, the claim for depreciation\r\n\r\nwas not admissible on the BSE membership card acquired by\r\n\r\nthe   assessee      u/s    32(1)(ii).     Consequently,         the      appeals\r\n\r\nfiled by the Department stood allowed, hence, these civil\r\n\r\nappeals.\r\n\r\nImportance of BSE:\r\n\r\n6.       BSE is recognized by the Government of India under\r\n \r\n\r\nSecurities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956. Approximately\r\n\r\n70000 deals are executed on a daily basis. There are about\r\n\r\n3500     companies    which     are    listed    on   BSE.     The     market\r\n\r\ncapitalization of the BSE is Rs. 5 trillion. The main aim\r\n\r\nand object of the BSE is to provide a market place for the\r\n\r\npurchase    and   sale     of   securities.      It   aims     to    promote,\r\n\r\ndevelop and maintain a well regulated market for dealing\r\n\r\nin   securities      and   to   safeguard       the   interests       of    the\r\n\r\nmembers and the investing public having dealings in the\r\n\r\nExchange. It helps industrial development of the country\r\n\r\nthrough resources mobilization. It is set up to establish\r\n\r\nand promote \"just practices\" in securities transactions.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1996, the BSE constituted a Trade Guarantee\r\n\r\nScheme    under    which    all    trades    carried     out    on     online\r\n\r\ntrading    are    guaranteed      by   the   clearing    house       of    BSE.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, a depository has been set up as a joint venture\r\n\r\nbetween BSE and Bank of India etc. BSE has introduced\r\n\r\ntrading also in fixed income securities to give impetus to\r\n\r\ntrading in debentures and corporate debt instruments to\r\n\r\nincrease trading in Government owned securities.\r\n\r\nQuestion arising in the Present Matters:\r\n\r\n7.     Is depreciation allowable on the cost of a Stock\r\n\r\n       Exchange Membership Card under Section 32(1)(ii)\r\n \r\n\r\n     of the Income Tax Act, 1961, which was enacted and\r\n\r\n     inserted by Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnswer to the above Question:\r\n\r\n8.     To   answer   the    above    question,   we   need   to   quote\r\n\r\nhereinbelow certain relevant provisions of the 1961 Act:\r\n\r\n     2. In this      Act,   unless    the   context    otherwise\r\n     requires,--\r\n\r\n     (14)\"capital asset\" means property of any kind\r\n     held by an assessee, whether or not connected with\r\n     his business or profession, but does not include--\r\n\r\n            (i)      any   stock-in-trade,   consumable\r\n        stores   or   raw   materials  held   for   the\r\n        purposes of his business or profession ;\r\n\r\n                (ii) personal effects, that is to say,\r\n        movable property (including wearing apparel and\r\n        furniture, but excluding jewellery) held for\r\n        personal use by the assessee or any member of\r\n        his family dependent on him.\r\n\r\n     Depreciation.\r\n\r\n     32.

We also quote hereinbelow relevant Rules of Bombay\r\n\r\nStock Exchange Limited as they stood at the relevant time:\r\n\r\n                \"Membership a Personal Privilege\r\n\r\n         5.

Upon   receipt   of   proposal   from   the   Development   Authority   for \r\n\r\n\r\nacquisition of 205.0288 hectares land of village Makora, Pargana Dankaur, \r\n\r\n\r\nTehsil and District Gautam Budh Nagar, which was approved by the State \r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment,   notification   dated   12.3.2008   was   issued   under   Section   4(1) \r\n\r\n\r\nread with Section 17(1) and 17(4) of the Act.   The relevant portions of the \r\n\r\n\r\nnotification are extracted below:\r\n\r\n\r\n              \"Under   Sub-Section   (1)   of   Section   4   of   the   Land \r\n\r\n              Acquisition Act 1894 (Act no.1 of 1894), the Governor is \r\n\r\n              pleased   to   notify   for   general   information   that   the   land \r\n\r\n              mentioned  in the scheduled  below, is  needed for  public \r\n\r\n              purpose,   namely   planned   industrial   development   in \r\n\r\n              District   Gautam   Budh   Nagar   through   Greater   Noida \r\n\r\n              Industrial Development Authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n              2.

Since the appellants\' land was also included in the notification, they \r\n\r\n\r\nmade a representation to the Chairman-cum-Chief Executive Officer of the \r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment   Authority   (Respondent   No.4)   with   copies   to   the   Chief \r\n\r\n\r\nMinister,   Principal   Secretary,   Housing   and   Urban   Development,   U.P.,   the \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDistrict   Magistrate   and   the   Special   Officer,   Land   Acquisition,   Gautam \r\n\r\n\r\nBuddh Nagar with the request that their land comprised   in Khasra No.394 \r\n\r\n\r\nmay not be acquired because they had raised construction 30-35 years ago \r\n\r\n\r\nand   were   using   the   property   for   abadi/habitation.   The   concerned \r\n\r\n\r\nfunctionaries/authorities did not pay heed to the request of the appellants and \r\n\r\n\r\nthe State Government issued notification dated 19.11.2008 under Section 6 \r\n\r\n\r\nread with Section 9 of the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.     The   appellants   challenged   the   acquisition   of   their   land   on   several \r\n\r\n\r\ngrounds including the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n       (i)      That the land cannot be used for industrial purposes because in \r\n\r\n\r\n       the draft Master Plan of Greater NOIDA (2021), the same is shown as \r\n\r\n\r\n       part of residential zone.  \r\n\r\n\r\n       (ii)     That they had already constructed dwelling  houses and as per \r\n\r\n\r\n       the   policy   of   the   State   Government,   the   residential   structures   are \r\n\r\n\r\n       exempted from acquisition.\r\n\r\n\r\n       (iii)    That   the   State   Government   arbitrarily   invoked   Section   17(1) \r\n\r\n\r\n       read with Section 17(4) of the Act and deprived them of their valuable \r\n\r\n\r\n       right to raise objections  under Section 5-A.\r\n\r\n\r\n       (iv)  The acquisition of land is vitiated by arbitrariness, mala fides and \r\n\r\n\r\n       violation  of  Article  14  of  the  Constitution   inasmuch  as   lands   of the \r\n\r\n\r\n       Member of Legislative  Assembly  and other influential persons were \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      left out from acquisition  despite the fact that they were not in abadi, \r\n\r\n\r\n      but   they   were   not   given   similar   treatment   despite   the   fact   that   their \r\n\r\n\r\n      land was part of abadi and they had constructed dwelling units.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6.    In support of their challenge to the invoking of Section 17(1) and (4), \r\n\r\n\r\nthe appellants made detailed averments in paragraphs 11 and 16 and raised \r\n\r\n\r\nspecific grounds A and F, which are extracted below:\r\n\r\n\r\n              \"11.   That   as   per   the   scheme   of   the   said   Act,   each   and \r\n\r\n              every  section  from sections  4  to 17  has  an independent \r\n\r\n              role   to   play   though   there   is   an   element   of   interaction \r\n\r\n              between them.  Section 5-A, has a very important role to \r\n\r\n              play in the acquisition proceedings and it is mandatory of \r\n\r\n              the part of the government to give hearing to the person \r\n\r\n              interested   in   the   land   whose   land   is   sought   to   be \r\n\r\n              acquired.    It is relevant  to point out that the acquisition \r\n\r\n              proceedings under the Act, are based on the principal of \r\n\r\n              eminent   domain   and   the   only   protection   given   to   the \r\n\r\n              person   whose   land   is   sought   to   be   acquired   is   an \r\n\r\n              opportunity under Section 5-A of the Act to convince the \r\n\r\n              enquiring authority that the purpose for which the land is \r\n\r\n              sought   to   be  acquired   is   in  fact   is   not   a  public   purpose \r\n\r\n              and is only purported to be one in the guise of a public \r\n\r\n              purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      It   is   relevant   to   mention   here   that   excluding   the \r\n\r\n              enquiry   under   Section   5-A   can   only   be   an   exception \r\n\r\n              where the urgency cannot brook any delay.  The enquiry \r\n\r\n              provides an opportunity to the owner of land to convince \r\n\r\n              the authorities concerned that the land in question is not \r\n\r\n              suitable for purpose for which it is sought to be acquired \r\n\r\n              or   the   same   sought   to   be   acquired   for   the   collateral \r\n\r\n              purposes.    It   is   pertinent   to   mention   here   that   the \r\n\r\n              respondents  No.  1  &amp;  2  without   the  application  of  mind \r\n\r\n              dispensed   with   the   enquiry   on   the   ground   of   urgency \r\n\r\n              invoking the power conferred by Section 17 (1) or (2) of \r\n\r\n              the   Act.     Further,   the   respondent   No.   1   &amp;   2   without \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplication of mind did not considered the survey report \r\n\r\nof the abadi of the village Makaura where the entire land \r\n\r\nis being used for the purpose of residence and grazing of \r\n\r\ncattle\'s in Khasra No. 394.  Further, the petitioners were \r\n\r\nsurprised to find that their land have not been included in \r\n\r\nthe   Abadi   irrespective   the   same   is   in   use   for   habitable \r\n\r\nand   keeping   the   cattle   and   other   uses.     The   petitioners \r\n\r\nhave   constructed   their   houses   and   using   the   same   for \r\n\r\ntheir   residence   and   keep   their   cattle\'s   and   agricultural \r\n\r\nproduce.    The   survey   report   clearly   shows   that   the \r\n\r\nimpugned Khasra  No. 394 is in use  for residence.    The \r\n\r\nreport in respect of the land in question falling in Khasra \r\n\r\nNo.   394   given   by   the   respondent   No.   4   vide \r\n\r\ncommunication   dated   26th  March,   2007   is   annexed   as \r\n\r\nAnnexure 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n16.     That   the   said   notification   under   Section   4   of   the \r\n\r\nAct   issued   by   the   respondent   No.   1   and   2   is   without \r\n\r\napplication   of   mind   and   there   was   no   urgency   in   the \r\n\r\nacquisition   of   land,   for   the   planned   industrial \r\n\r\ndevelopment, as the land, as per the master plan - 2021 \r\n\r\nthe   land   of   the   village   Makaura   is   reserved   for \r\n\r\n\"residential\"   of   which   the   respondent   No.   2   invoked \r\n\r\nSection 17 (1) and subsection 4 of the Act by dispensing \r\n\r\nwith an enquiry under Section 5A of the Act.   The said \r\n\r\naction   on   the   part   of   the   respondents   are   un-warranted \r\n\r\nand is in gross violation of Article 14,19, 21 and 300A of \r\n\r\nthe constitution.   The such illegal  act on the part of the \r\n\r\nrespondents show mala fide and their oblique motive to \r\n\r\ndeprive   the   owners   from  their   houses   in   order   to   fulfill \r\n\r\ntheir political obligations/promise to the private builders \r\n\r\nby   taking   the   shelter   of   section   17   of   the   Act   by \r\n\r\ndispensing with the enquiry under Section 5-A of the Act \r\n\r\nas well as overlooked purpose as stipulated in the Master \r\n\r\nPlan   2021   which   is   any   way   do   not   require   any   urgent \r\n\r\nattention. \r\n\r\n\r\nA.      That the whole acquisition proceedings   are void, \r\n\r\nunconstitutional,   tainted   with   mala   fide,   abuse   of \r\n\r\nauthority   and   power,   non-application   of   mind,   and   as \r\n\r\nsuch, liable to be quashed as violative of Articles 14,19 \r\n\r\nand 300-A of the Constitution of India. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            F.      That   the   purpose   stated   in   the   notification   under \r\n\r\n            Section   4   and   declaration   under   section   6   by   invoking \r\n\r\n            section   17   is   presently   non-existent   and   thus   the \r\n\r\n            notification   is   bad   in   law.   There   is   no   urgency   for   the \r\n\r\n            invocation   when   the   land   is   to   be   acquired   for   planned \r\n\r\n            development for the purpose of setting residential colony. \r\n\r\n            The impugned             notification   is   without   any   authority \r\n\r\n            of law and volatile of Article 300-A of the Constitution \r\n\r\n            of   India,   which   limits   the   power   to   acquire   land   to   the \r\n\r\n            authority under the Land Acquisition Act.  Therefore, the \r\n\r\n            notification in question is bad in law.\"\r\n\r\n                                                              (emphasis supplied)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7.    The  High  Court negatived  the  appellants\'   challenge  at the  threshold \r\n\r\n\r\nmainly on the ground that the averments contained in the petition were not \r\n\r\n\r\nsupported by a proper affidavit.  This is evident from the following portions \r\n\r\n\r\nof the impugned order:\r\n\r\n\r\n            \"Here the petitioners neither have pleaded that there exist \r\n\r\n            no material before  the State Government to come to the \r\n\r\n            conclusion that the enquiry under Section 5-A should be \r\n\r\n            dispensed with by invoking Section 17(4) of the Act nor \r\n\r\n            the learned counsel for the petitioners could place before \r\n\r\n            us   any   such   averment   in   the   writ   petition.   Though,   in \r\n\r\n            para-11 of the writ petition, an averment has been made \r\n\r\n            that the respondents no. 1 and 2 without the application \r\n\r\n            of   mind   dispensed   with   the   enquiry   on   the   ground   of \r\n\r\n            urgency  invoking the power conferred by Section  17(1) \r\n\r\n            or (2) of the Act, but in the affidavit, the said paragraph \r\n\r\n            has   been   sworn   on   the   basis   of   perusal   of   record. \r\n\r\n            Similarly   in   para   16   of   the   writ   petition,   the   only \r\n\r\n            averment contained therein is as under:\r\n\r\n\r\n            \"16. That the said notification under Section 4 of the \r\n\r\n            Act   issued   by   the   respondent   No.1   and   2   is   without \r\n\r\n            application of mind and there was no urgency in the \r\n\r\n            acquisition   of   land,   for   the   planned   industrial \r\n\r\n            development, as the land, as per the master plan-2021 \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               the   land   of   the   village   Makaura   is   reserved   for \r\n\r\n               \"residential\"   of   which   the   respondent   No.2   invoked \r\n\r\n               Section   17(1)   and   sub-section   4   of   the   Act   by \r\n\r\n               dispensing with an enquiry under Section 5-A of the \r\n\r\n               Act. The said action on the part of the respondents are \r\n\r\n               un-warranted   and   is   in   gross   violation   of   Article \r\n\r\n               14,19,21   and   300A   of   the   Constitution.     The   such \r\n\r\n               illegal   act   on  the   part   of  the  respondents   show   mala \r\n\r\n               fide   and   their   oblique   motive   to   deprive   the   owners \r\n\r\n               from   their   houses   in   order   to   fulfill   their   political \r\n\r\n               obligations/ promise to the private builders by taking \r\n\r\n               the shelter of Section 17 of the Act by dispensing with \r\n\r\n               the  enquiry  under Section   5-A  of the  Act as  well  as \r\n\r\n               overlooked   purpose   as   stipulated   in   the   Master   Plan \r\n\r\n               2021   which   is   any   way   do   not   require   any   urgent \r\n\r\n               attention.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n               However, in the affidavit, this para has not been sworn at \r\n\r\n               all   and   in   any   case   with   respect   to   dispensation   of \r\n\r\n               enquiry under Section 5-A by invoking  Section 17(4) of \r\n\r\n               the Act nothing has been said except that the exercise of \r\n\r\n               power is violative of Articles 14,19, 21 and 300-A of the \r\n\r\n               Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n               We, therefore, do not find any occasion even to call upon \r\n\r\n               the   respondents   to   file   a   counter   affidavit   placing   on \r\n\r\n               record,   the   material   if   any   for   exercising   power   under \r\n\r\n               Section   17(1)   and   (4)   of   the   Act   in   the   absence   of   any \r\n\r\n               relevant   pleading   or   material   and   the   question   of \r\n\r\n               requiring the respondents to produce the original record \r\n\r\n               in this regard also does not arise.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8.     The   High   Court   distinguished   the   judgment   of   this   Court   in  Om \r\n\r\n\r\nPrakash   v.   State   of   U.P.  (1998)   6   SCC   1,   albeit   without   assigning   any \r\n\r\n\r\ncogent   reason,   relied   upon   the   judgments   of   the   Division   Benches   in \r\n\r\n\r\nKshama Sahkari Avas Samiti Ltd. v. State of U.P.  2007 (1) AWC 327, \r\n\r\n\r\nJasraj Singh v. State of U.P. 2008 (8) ADJ 329 and Jagriti Sahkari Avas \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSamiti Ltd. Ghaziabad v. State of U.P. 2008 (9) ADJ 43 and held that the \r\n\r\n\r\ndecision of the Government to invoke Section 17(1) cannot be subjected to \r\n\r\n\r\njudicial   review.   The   High   Court   also   rejected   the   appellants\'   plea   that   in \r\n\r\n\r\nterms  of  the  policy  framed by  the   State   Government, the  land   covered   by \r\n\r\n\r\nabadi cannot be acquired by observing that no material has been placed on \r\n\r\n\r\nrecord   to   show   that   the   policy   framed   in   1991   was   still   continuing.     To \r\n\r\n\r\nbuttress   this   conclusion,   the   High   Court   relied   upon   the   judgment   of   this \r\n\r\n\r\nCourt in Anand Buttons Limited v. State of Haryana (2005) 9 SCC 164.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9.      By an order dated 29.10.2010, this Court, after taking cognizance of \r\n\r\n\r\nthe fact that the respondents did not get opportunity to file reply to the writ \r\n\r\n\r\npetition, directed them to do so. Thereupon, Shri Harnam Singh, Additional \r\n\r\n\r\nDistrict   Magistrate   (Land   Acquisition)/Officer   on   Special   Duty   (Land \r\n\r\n\r\nAcquisition) NOIDA, District Gautam Budh Nagar filed counter affidavit on \r\n\r\n\r\nbehalf   of   respondent   Nos.1   to   3.     In   paragraph   10   of   his   affidavit,   Shri \r\n\r\n\r\nHarnam  Singh   has   attempted   to   justify   invoking   of   the   urgency   clause   by \r\n\r\n\r\nmaking the following assertions:\r\n\r\n\r\n                \"That   in   invoking   the   urgency   clause   the   State \r\n\r\n                Government   has   taken   into   consideration   the   following \r\n\r\n                factors:-\r\n\r\n\r\n                i)      Greater   Noida   Industrial   Development   Authority \r\n\r\n                was   constituted   under   the   U.P.   Industrial   Area \r\n\r\n                Development Act, 1976 to promote Industrial and Urban \r\n\r\n                Development   in   the   Area.     The   acquired   land   was \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             urgently   required   by   the   Development   Authority   for \r\n\r\n             planned Industrial Development of the area.\r\n\r\n\r\n             ii)     That the land in the adjoining villages were already \r\n\r\n             acquired   by   the   Greater   Noida   Industrial   Development \r\n\r\n             Authority.  Thus, the acquired land was urgently required \r\n\r\n             for   continuity   of   infrastructure   services   and   planned \r\n\r\n             Industrial   Development   of   the   Area.     If,   the   proposed \r\n\r\n             land   was   not   acquired   immediately   and   delay   in   this \r\n\r\n             regard would lead to encroachments and would adversely \r\n\r\n             affect the Planned Industrial Development of the Area.\r\n\r\n\r\n             iii)    That   the   acquired   land   was   required   for   overall \r\n\r\n             development   i.e.   construction   of   roads,   laying   of \r\n\r\n             sewerages,   providing   electricity   etc.   in   the   area   and  the \r\n\r\n             said   scheme   has   been   duly   approved   by   the   state \r\n\r\n             government.\r\n\r\n\r\n             iv)     That   the   acquired   land   consists   of   246   plots \r\n\r\n             numbers with 392 recorded tenure holders.  If objections \r\n\r\n             are   to   be   invited   and   hearing   be   given   to   such   large \r\n\r\n             number   of   tenure   holders,   it   would   take   long   time   to \r\n\r\n             dispose of the objections thereof and would hamper the \r\n\r\n             planned development of the area.\r\n\r\n\r\n             v)      That   reputed   industrial   houses   who   are   interested \r\n\r\n                     in investing in the State and in case the land is not \r\n\r\n                     readily available, they might move to other states \r\n\r\n                     and   such   a   move   would   adversely   affect   the \r\n\r\n                     employment opportunities in the State.\"                  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Shri   Harnam   Singh   also   controverted   the   appellants\'   plea   for \r\n\r\n\r\nexemption by stating that the constructions made by them on land of Khasra \r\n\r\n\r\nNos.101 and 399 were insignificant  and the construction raised on Khasra \r\n\r\n\r\nNo.394 is not part of village Abadi.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10.     Shri   Manoj   Kumar   Singh,   Tehsildar   filed   a   separate   affidavit   on \r\n\r\n\r\nbehalf of Respondent No.4 and justified the invoking of urgency clause by \r\n\r\n\r\nasserting that large tracts of land were acquired for industrial development \r\n\r\n\r\nof the district.  According to him, as per the policy of industrial development \r\n\r\n\r\nof   the   State   Government,   the   land   is   required   to   be   allotted   to   industrial \r\n\r\n\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\n\r\n11.     On   8.11.2010,  Shri   Dinesh   Dwivedi  learned   senior   counsel   for   the \r\n\r\n\r\nState   made   a   request   for   permission   to   file   additional   affidavit   with   some \r\n\r\n\r\ndocuments. His request was accepted.   Thereafter, the respondents filed an \r\n\r\n\r\naffidavit   of   Shri   Sushil   Kumar   Chaubey,   Tehsildar,   Land   Acquisition, \r\n\r\n\r\nGautam Budh Nagar along with eight documents of which seven have been \r\n\r\n\r\ncollectively marked as Annexure A-1.     The first of the documents marked \r\n\r\n\r\nAnnexure A-1 is copy of letter dated 25.2.2008 sent by the Commissioner \r\n\r\n\r\nand Director, Directorate of Land Acquisition, Revenue Board, U.P. to the \r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial   Secretary,   Industrial   Development   on   the   subject   of   issuance   of \r\n\r\n\r\nnotification   under   Sections   4   and   17   of   the   Act   for   acquisition   of   lands \r\n\r\n\r\nmeasuring 205.0288 hectares of village Makora.  The second document is an \r\n\r\n\r\nundated   letter   signed   by   Deputy   Chief   Executive   Officer,   Greater   Noida, \r\n\r\n\r\nCollector,  Gautam Budh Nagar and four other  officers/officials.    The  next \r\n\r\n\r\ndocument has been  described as comments/certificate on the issues raised in \r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment Order No.5261/77-4-06-251N/06 dated 21.12.2006 with regard \r\n\r\n\r\nto   proposal   for   acquisition   of   205.0288   hectares   lands   in   village   Makora. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis   document   is   accompanied   by   seven   forms   containing   various \r\n\r\n\r\nparticulars.  The third document is communication dated 29.10.2007 sent by \r\n\r\n\r\nthe   Commissioner,   Meerut   Division,   Meerut   to   the   District   Magistrate, \r\n\r\n\r\nGautam Budh Nagar conveying  the consent  of the Divisional Land Utility \r\n\r\n\r\nCommittee  for the acquisition of   lands of five villages including Makora. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter is accompanied by minutes of the meeting of the Divisional Land \r\n\r\n\r\nUtility Committee held on 29.10.2007.  The fifth document is form No.43A-\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  The sixth document is communication dated 22.2.2008 sent by Collector, \r\n\r\n\r\nLand Acquisition/Special Land Acquisition Officer, Greater Noida.  The last \r\n\r\n\r\ndocument which forms part of Annexure A-1 is form No.16 showing the list \r\n\r\n\r\nof properties having constructions etc.  Annexure A-2 is copy of letter dated \r\n\r\n\r\n31.10.2008   sent   by   the   Director,   Directorate   of   Land   Acquisition   to   the \r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial Secretary, Industrial Development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12.     Shri   N.P.Singh,   learned   counsel   for   the   appellants   argued   that   the \r\n\r\n\r\nimpugned   order   is   liable   to   be   set   aside   because   the   High   Court   failed   to \r\n\r\n\r\nconsider   the   issues   raised   in   the   writ   petition   in   a   correct   perspective. \r\n\r\n\r\nLearned counsel submitted that the appellants had specifically pleaded that \r\n\r\n\r\nthere was no valid ground to invoke the urgency clause contained in Section \r\n\r\n\r\n17(1) and to dispense with the application of Section 5-A but the High Court \r\n\r\n\r\ndid not even call upon the respondents to file counter affidavit and brushed \r\n\r\n\r\naside   the   challenge   to   the   acquisition   proceeding   on   a   wholly   untenable \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npremise  that  the  affidavit filed in support of the writ  petition was laconic. \r\n\r\n\r\nLearned counsel further argued that the purpose for which land was acquired \r\n\r\n\r\ni.e. planned industrial development of the district did not justify invoking of \r\n\r\n\r\nthe urgency provisions and denial of opportunity to the appellants and other \r\n\r\n\r\nland owners to file objections under Section 5-A (1) and to be heard by the \r\n\r\n\r\nCollector   in   terms   of   the   mandate   of   Section   5-A   (2).   In   support   of   his \r\n\r\n\r\nargument,  learned  counsel   relied   upon  the   judgments  in  Narayan   Govind \r\n\r\n\r\nGavate v. State of Maharashtra (1977) 1 SCC 133 and Esso Fabs Private \r\n\r\n\r\nLimited v. State of Haryana  (2009) 2 SCC 377. Another argument of the \r\n\r\n\r\nlearned   counsel   is   that   the   High   Court   misdirected   itself   in   summarily \r\n\r\n\r\ndismissing the writ petition ignoring the substantive plea of discrimination \r\n\r\n\r\nraised by the appellants. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13.     Shri   Dinesh   Dwivedi,   learned   senior   counsel   appearing   for   the \r\n\r\n\r\nrespondents urged that this Court should   not nullify the acquisition at the \r\n\r\n\r\ninstance of the appellants because the pleadings filed before the High Court \r\n\r\n\r\nwere not supported by proper affidavit. Shri Dwivedi argued that the High \r\n\r\n\r\nCourt   was   justified   in   non-suiting   the   appellants   because   they   did   not \r\n\r\n\r\nproduce   any   evidence   to   effectively   challenge   the   invoking   of   urgency \r\n\r\n\r\nprovision   contained   in   Section   17(1).   Learned   senior   counsel   emphasized \r\n\r\n\r\nthat the satisfaction envisaged in Section 17(1) is purely subjective and the \r\n\r\n\r\nCourt cannot review the decision taken by the State Government to invoke \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   urgency   clause.   He   submitted   that   planned   industrial   development   of \r\n\r\n\r\nDistrict   Gautam   Budh   Nagar   is   being   undertaken   in   consonance   with   the \r\n\r\n\r\npolicy decision taken by the State Government and the appellants cannot be \r\n\r\n\r\nheard to make a grievance against the acquisition of their land because they \r\n\r\n\r\nwill be duly compensated. In support of his argument, Shri Dwivedi relied \r\n\r\n\r\nupon the judgment of this Court in State of U.P. v. Pista Devi (1986) 4 SCC \r\n\r\n\r\n251 and Chameli Singh v. State of U.P. (1996) 2 SCC 549.  Learned senior \r\n\r\n\r\ncounsel further submitted that the appellants\' land cannot be released from \r\n\r\n\r\nacquisition   because   that   will   result   in   frustrating   the   objective   of   planned \r\n\r\n\r\nindustrial   development  of  the  district.   On the  issue of discrimination,  Shri \r\n\r\n\r\nDwivedi argued that even  if the land belonging to some persons has been \r\n\r\n\r\nillegally   left   out   from   acquisition,   the   appellants   are   not   entitled   to   a \r\n\r\n\r\ndirection that their land should also be released.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14.     The first issue which needs to be addressed is whether the High Court \r\n\r\n\r\nwas justified in non-suiting  the appellants on the ground that they had not \r\n\r\n\r\nraised a specific plea supported by a proper affidavit to question the decision \r\n\r\n\r\ntaken by the State Government to invoke Section 17(1) and 17(4) of the Act. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall also consider an ancillary issue   as to whether the appellants had \r\n\r\n\r\nsucceeded   in prima facie proving   that there was no justification to invoke \r\n\r\n\r\nthe urgency clause and to dispense with the inquiry envisaged under Section \r\n\r\n\r\n5-A.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15.           At   the   outset,   we   record   our   disapproval   of   the   casual   manner   in \r\n\r\n\r\nwhich the High Court disposed of the writ petition without even calling upon \r\n\r\n\r\nthe respondents to file counter affidavit and produce the relevant records. A \r\n\r\n\r\nreading of the averments contained in paragraphs 11 and 16 and grounds A \r\n\r\n\r\nand F of the writ petition, which have been extracted hereinabove   coupled \r\n\r\n\r\nwith the appellants\' assertion that the acquisition of their land was vitiated \r\n\r\n\r\ndue to discrimination inasmuch as  land belonging to influential persons had \r\n\r\n\r\nbeen left out from acquisition, but their land was acquired in total disregard \r\n\r\n\r\nof the policy of the State Government to leave out  land on which dwelling \r\n\r\n\r\nunits had already been constructed, show that they had succeeded in making \r\n\r\n\r\nout   a   strong   case   for   deeper   examination   of   the   issues   raised   in   the   writ \r\n\r\n\r\npetition     and   the  High   Court    committed   serious   error   by   summarily   non-\r\n\r\n\r\nsuiting them. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16.     The history of land acquisition legislations shows that in Eighteenth \r\n\r\n\r\nCentury, Bengal Regulation I of 1824, Act I of 1850, Act VI of 1857, Act \r\n\r\n\r\nXXII of 1863, Act X of 1870, Bombay Act No. XXVIII of 1839, Bombay \r\n\r\n\r\nAct No. XVII of 1850, Madras Act No. XX of 1852 and Madras Act No.1 of \r\n\r\n\r\n1854 were enacted to facilitate the acquisition of land and other immovable \r\n\r\n\r\nproperties for roads, canals, and other public purposes by paying the amount \r\n\r\n\r\nto be determined by the arbitrators.  In 1870, the Land Acquisition Act was \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenacted   to   provide   for   proper   valuation   of   the   acquired   land.     That   Act \r\n\r\n\r\nenvisaged that if the person having interest in   land is not agreeable to part \r\n\r\n\r\nwith possession by accepting the amount offered to him, then the Collector \r\n\r\n\r\nmay   make   a   reference   to   the   Civil   Court.   The   1870   Act   also   envisaged \r\n\r\n\r\nappointment   of   assessors   to   assist   the   Civil   Court.     If   the   Court   and   the \r\n\r\n\r\nassessor   did not  agree  on  the amount  then an  appeal  could be  filed  in  the \r\n\r\n\r\nHigh   Court.     This   mechanism   proved   ineffective   because   lot   of   time   was \r\n\r\n\r\nconsumed   in   litigation.     With   a   view   to   overcome   this   problem,   the \r\n\r\n\r\nlegislature   enacted   the   Act   on   the   line   of   the   English   Lands   Clauses \r\n\r\n\r\nConsolidation   Act,   1845.     However,   the   land   owners   or   persons   having \r\n\r\n\r\ninterest in land did not have any say in the acquisition process either under \r\n\r\n\r\npre-1984   legislations   or   the   1984   Act   (un-amended).   They   could   raise \r\n\r\n\r\nobjection   only   qua   the   amount   of   compensation   and   matters   connected \r\n\r\n\r\ntherewith.     The   absence   of   opportunity   to   raise   objection   against   the \r\n\r\n\r\nacquisition of land was resented by those who were deprived of their land. \r\n\r\n\r\nTo redress this grievance, Section 5A was inserted in the Act by amending \r\n\r\n\r\nAct No.38 of 1923.  The statement of Objects and Reasons contained in Bill \r\n\r\n\r\nNo.29 of 1923, which led to enactment of the amending Act read as under:\r\n\r\n\r\n                \"The   Land   Acquisition   Act   I   of   1894   does   not   provide \r\n\r\n                that   persons   having   an   interest   in   land   which   it   is \r\n\r\n                proposed to acquire, shall have the right of objecting to \r\n\r\n                such   acquisition;   nor   is   Government   bound   to   enquire \r\n\r\n                into   and   consider   any   objections   that   may   reach   them. \r\n\r\n                The   object   of   this   Bill   is   to   provide   that   a   Local \r\n\r\n                Government shall not declare, under Section 6 of the Act, \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            that any land is needed for a public purpose unless time \r\n\r\n            has   been   allowed   after   the   notification   under   Section   4 \r\n\r\n            for persons interested in the land to put in objections and \r\n\r\n            for   such   objections   to   be   considered   by   the   Local \r\n\r\n            Government.\"   \r\n\r\n\r\n17.             The   Act,   which   was   enacted   more   than   116   years   ago   for \r\n\r\n\r\nfacilitating   the   acquisition   of   land   and   other   immovable   properties   for \r\n\r\n\r\nconstruction of roads, canals, railways etc., has been frequently used in \r\n\r\n\r\nthe   post   independence   era   for   different   public   purposes   like   laying   of \r\n\r\n\r\nroads,     construction   of   bridges,   dams   and   buildings   of   various   public \r\n\r\n\r\nestablishments/institutions,   planned   development   of   urban   areas, \r\n\r\n\r\nproviding   of   houses   to   different   sections   of   the   society   and   for \r\n\r\n\r\ndeveloping residential colonies/sectors.  However, in the recent years, the \r\n\r\n\r\ncountry has witnessed a new phenomena.  Large tracts of land have been \r\n\r\n\r\nacquired in   rural parts of the country in the name of development and \r\n\r\n\r\ntransferred   to   private   entrepreneurs,   who   have   utilized   the   same   for \r\n\r\n\r\nconstruction   of   multi-storied   complexes,   commercial   centers   and   for \r\n\r\n\r\nsetting up industrial units.   Similarly, large scale acquisitions have been \r\n\r\n\r\nmade on behalf of the companies by invoking the provisions contained in \r\n\r\n\r\nPart VII of the Act. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18.       The resultant effect of these acquisitions is that the land owners, \r\n\r\n\r\nwho  were doing  agricultural   operations  and  other  ancillary   activities   in \r\n\r\n\r\nrural   areas,   have   been   deprived   of   the   only   source   of   their   livelihood. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMajority of them do not have any idea about their constitutional and legal \r\n\r\n\r\nrights,   which   can   be   enforced   by   availing   the   constitutional   remedies \r\n\r\n\r\nunder   Articles   32   and   226   of   the   Constitution.     They   reconcile   with \r\n\r\n\r\ndeprivation of land by accepting the amount of compensation offered by \r\n\r\n\r\nthe   Government   and   by   thinking   that   it   is   their   fate   and   destiny \r\n\r\n\r\ndetermined   by   God.     Even   those   who   get   semblance   of   education   are \r\n\r\n\r\nneither   conversant   with   the   functioning   of  the  State   apparatus   nor   they \r\n\r\n\r\ncan access the records prepared by the concerned authorities as a prelude \r\n\r\n\r\nto the acquisition of   land by invoking Section 4 with or without the aid \r\n\r\n\r\nof   Section   17(1)   and/or   17(4).       Therefore,   while   examining   the   land \r\n\r\n\r\nowner\'s   challenge   to   the   acquisition   of   land   in   a   petition   filed   under \r\n\r\n\r\nArticle   226   of   the   Constitution,     the   High   Court   should   not   adopt   a \r\n\r\n\r\npedantic approach, as has been done in the present case, and decide the \r\n\r\n\r\nmatter  keeping  in  view the  constitutional   goals  of  social  and  economic \r\n\r\n\r\njustice and the fact that even though the right to property is no longer a \r\n\r\n\r\nfundamental right, the same continues to be an important constitutional \r\n\r\n\r\nright   and   in   terms   of   Article   300-A,   no   person   can   be   deprived   of   his \r\n\r\n\r\nproperty   except   by   authority   of   law.     In   cases   where   the   acquisition   is \r\n\r\n\r\nmade   by   invoking   Section   4   read   with   Section   17(1)   and/or   17(4),   the \r\n\r\n\r\nHigh Court should insist upon filing of reply affidavit by the respondents \r\n\r\n\r\nand production of the relevant records and carefully scrutinize the same \r\n\r\n\r\nbefore   pronouncing   upon   legality   of   the   impugned   notification/action \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause a negative result without examining the relevant records to find \r\n\r\n\r\nout whether the competent authority had formed a bona fide opinion on \r\n\r\n\r\nthe issue of invoking the urgency provision and excluding the application \r\n\r\n\r\nof Section 5-A is likely to make the land owner a landless poor and force \r\n\r\n\r\nhim to migrate to the nearby city only to live in a slum.  A departure from \r\n\r\n\r\nthis   rule   should   be   made   only   when   land   is   required   to   meet   really \r\n\r\n\r\nemergent   situations   like   those   enumerated   in   Section   17(2).     If   the \r\n\r\n\r\nacquisition   is   intended   to   benefit   private   person(s)   and   the   provisions \r\n\r\n\r\ncontained in Section 17(1) and/or 17(4) are invoked, then scrutiny of the \r\n\r\n\r\njustification   put forward  by  the  State  should  be  more  rigorous  in cases \r\n\r\n\r\ninvolving the challenge to the acquisition of land, the pleadings should be \r\n\r\n\r\nliberally   construed   and   relief   should   not   be   denied   to   the   petitioner   by \r\n\r\n\r\napplying the technical rules of procedure embodied in the Code of Civil \r\n\r\n\r\nProcedure and other procedural laws. In this context it will be profitable \r\n\r\n\r\nto   notice   the   observations   made   by   this   Court   in  Authorised   Officer, \r\n\r\n\r\nThanjavur   v.   S   Naganatha   Ayyar  (1979)   3   SCC   466,   which   are     as \r\n\r\n\r\nunder:\r\n\r\n\r\n            \"It is true that Judges are constitutional invigilators \r\n\r\n            and   statutory   interpreters;   but   they   are   also   responsive \r\n\r\n            and responsible to Part IV of the Constitution being one \r\n\r\n            of  the   trinity   of  the  nation\'s   appointed   instrumentalities \r\n\r\n            in   the   transformation   of   the   socio-economic   order.   The \r\n\r\n            judiciary, in its sphere, shares the revolutionary purpose \r\n\r\n            of   the   constitutional   order,   and   when   called   upon   to \r\n\r\n            decode   social   legislation   must   be   animated   by   a   goal-\r\n\r\n            oriented   approach.   This   is   part   of   the   dynamics   of \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                statutory   interpretation   in   the   developing   countries   so \r\n\r\n                that courts are not converted into rescue shelters for those \r\n\r\n                who  seek  to  defeat  agrarian  justice  by  cute  transactions \r\n\r\n                of   many   manifestations   now   so   familiar   in   the   country \r\n\r\n                and   illustrated   by   the   several   cases   under   appeal.   This \r\n\r\n                caveat has become necessary because the judiciary is not \r\n\r\n                a mere umpire, as some assume, but an activist catalyst in \r\n\r\n                the constitutional scheme.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19.     We may now advert to the ancillary question whether the High Court \r\n\r\n\r\nwas justified in non suiting the appellants on the ground that they failed to \r\n\r\n\r\ndischarge   the   primary   burden   of   proving   that   the   State   Government   had \r\n\r\n\r\ninvoked Section 17(1) and 17(4) without application of mind to the relevant \r\n\r\n\r\nconsiderations.   In this context, it is apposite to observe that while dealing \r\n\r\n\r\nwith challenge to the acquisition  of land belonging to those who suffer from \r\n\r\n\r\nhandicaps of poverty, illiteracy and ignorance and do not have the resources \r\n\r\n\r\nto access the material relied upon by the functionaries of the   State and its \r\n\r\n\r\nagencies for forming an opinion or recording a satisfaction that the urgency \r\n\r\n\r\nprovisions   contained   in   Section   17(1)   should   be   resorted   to   and/or   the \r\n\r\n\r\nenquiry   envisaged   under   Section   5A   should     be   dispensed   with,   the   High \r\n\r\n\r\nCourt   should   not   literally   apply   the   abstract   rules   of   burden   of   proof \r\n\r\n\r\nenshrined   in   the   Evidence   Act.     It   is   too   much   to   expect   from   the   rustic \r\n\r\n\r\nvillagers, who are not conversant with the intricacies of law and functioning \r\n\r\n\r\nof the judicial system in our country to first obtain relevant information and \r\n\r\n\r\nrecords   from   the   concerned   State   authorities   and   then   present   skillfully \r\n\r\n\r\ndrafted petition for enforcement of his legal and/or constitutional rights. The \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCourt should also bear in mind that the relevant records are always  in the \r\n\r\n\r\nexclusive   possession/domain   of   the   authorities   of   the   State   and/or   its \r\n\r\n\r\nagencies.     Therefore,   an   assertion   by   the   appellants   that   there   was   no \r\n\r\n\r\nurgency   in   the   acquisition   of   land;   that   the   concerned   authorities   did   not \r\n\r\n\r\napply  mind  to  the  relevant  factors  and  records  and  arbitrarily  invoked  the \r\n\r\n\r\nurgency   provisions   and   thereby   denied   him   the   minimum   opportunity   of \r\n\r\n\r\nhearing in terms of Section 5-A(1) and (2), should be treated as sufficient \r\n\r\n\r\nfor   calling   upon   the   respondents   to   file   their   response   and   produce   the \r\n\r\n\r\nrelevant records to justify the invoking of urgency provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n20.     In  Narayan   Govind   Gavate   v.   State   of   Maharashtra  (supra),   the \r\n\r\n\r\nthree-Judge Bench of this Court examined the correctness of the judgment \r\n\r\n\r\nof   the   Bombay   High   Court   whereby   the   acquisition   of   land   by   the   State \r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment by issuing notification under Section 4 read with Section 17(1) \r\n\r\n\r\nand 17(4) for development and utilisation as residential and industrial area \r\n\r\n\r\nwas  quashed.   The   High Court held  that  the  purpose  of  acquisition  was a \r\n\r\n\r\ngenuine public purpose but quashed the notifications by observing that the \r\n\r\n\r\nburden   of   proving   the   existence   of   circumstances   which   could   justify \r\n\r\n\r\ninvoking   of   urgency   clause   was   on   the   State,   which   it   had   failed   to \r\n\r\n\r\ndischarge. Some of the observations made by the High Court, which have \r\n\r\n\r\nbeen extracted in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the judgment of this Court, are \r\n\r\n\r\nreproduced below.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When the formation of an opinion or the satisfaction of \r\n\r\nan authority is subjective but is a condition precedent to \r\n\r\nthe exercise of a power, the challenge to the formation of \r\n\r\nsuch opinion or to such satisfaction is limited, in law, to \r\n\r\nthree   points   only.   It   can   be   challenged,   firstly,   on   the \r\n\r\nground   of   mala   fides;   secondly,   on   the   ground   that   the \r\n\r\nauthority which formed that opinion or which arrived at \r\n\r\nsuch satisfaction did not apply its mind to the material on \r\n\r\nwhich it formed the opinion or arrived at the satisfaction, \r\n\r\nand,   thirdly,   that   the   material   on   which   it   formed   its \r\n\r\nopinion   or   reached   the   satisfaction   was   so   insufficient \r\n\r\nthat no man  could reasonably  reach that conclusion.  So \r\n\r\nfar as the third point is concerned, no court of law can, as \r\n\r\nin an appeal, consider that, on the material placed before \r\n\r\nthe   authority,   the   authority   was   justified   in   reaching   its \r\n\r\nconclusion.   The   court   can   interfere   only   in   such   cases \r\n\r\nwhere there was no material at all or the material was so \r\n\r\ninsufficient   that   no   man   could   have   reasonably   reached \r\n\r\nthat conclusion. \r\n\r\nIn   the   case   before   us   the   petitioner   has   stated   in   the \r\n\r\npetition more than once that the urgency clause had been \r\n\r\napplied without any valid reason. The urgency clause in \r\n\r\nrespect of each of the said two notifications  concerning \r\n\r\nthe lands in Groups 1 and 2 is contained in the relative \r\n\r\nSection 4 notification itself. The public purpose stated in \r\n\r\nthe notification is `for development and utilization of the \r\n\r\nsaid lands as an industrial and residential area\'. To start \r\n\r\nwith, this statement itself is vague, in the sense that it is \r\n\r\nnot clear whether the development and utilization of the \r\n\r\nlands   referred   to   in   that   statement   was   confined   to   the \r\n\r\nlands mentioned in the schedule to the notification or it \r\n\r\napplied to a wider area of which such lands formed only \r\n\r\na   part.   So   far   as   the   affidavit   in   reply   is   concerned,   no \r\n\r\nfacts   whatever   are   stated.   The   affidavit   only   states   that \r\n\r\nthe   authority   i.e.   the   Commissioner   of   the   Bombay \r\n\r\nDivision   was   satisfied   that   the   possession   of   the   said \r\n\r\nlands  was  urgently   required   for the  purpose   of  carrying \r\n\r\nout   the   said   development.   Even   Mr   Setalvad   conceded \r\n\r\nthat the affidavit does not contain a statement of facts on \r\n\r\nwhich the authority was satisfied or on which it formed \r\n\r\nits   opinion.  It   is,   therefore,   quite   clear   that   the \r\n\r\nrespondents  have failed  to bring on record any material \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                whatever   on   which   the   respondents   formed   the   opinion \r\n\r\n                mentioned   in   the   two   notifications.  The   notifications \r\n\r\n                themselves show that they concern many lands other than \r\n\r\n                those   falling   in   the   said   first   and   third   groups.   It   is   not \r\n\r\n                possible   to   know   what   was   the   development   for   which \r\n\r\n                the lands were being acquired, much less is it possible to \r\n\r\n                know   what   were   the   circumstances   which   caused \r\n\r\n                urgency   in   the   taking   of   possession   of   such   lands.  We \r\n\r\n                have held that the burden of proving such circumstances, \r\n\r\n                at   least   prima   facie   is   on   the   respondents.   As   the \r\n\r\n                respondents   have   brought   no   relevant   material   on   the \r\n\r\n                record,   the   respondents   have   failed   to   discharge   that \r\n\r\n                burden.  We   must,   in   conclusion,   hold   that   the   urgency \r\n\r\n                provision   under   Section   17(4)   was   not   validly   resorted \r\n\r\n                to.\"\r\n\r\n                                                                     (emphasis supplied)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        While   dealing   with   the   argument   of   the   State   that   it   was   for   the \r\n\r\n\r\npetitioner   to   prove   that   there   was   no   material   to   justify   invoking   of   the \r\n\r\n\r\nurgency clause, this Court observed:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"We do not think that a question relating to burden of proof is \r\n\r\n        always free from difficulty or is quite so simple as it is sought \r\n\r\n        to   be   made   out   here.   Indeed,   the   apparent   simplicity   of   a \r\n\r\n        question relating to presumptions and burdens of proof, which \r\n\r\n        have   to   be   always   viewed   together   is   often   deceptive.   Over \r\n\r\n        simplification  of  such  questions  leads  to  erroneous  statements \r\n\r\n        and misapplications of the law.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        The Court then referred to the judgment in Woolmington v. Director \r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Prosecutions,  1935 AC 462, extensively quoted from     Phipson on \r\n\r\n\r\nEvidence (11th Edn),  noticed Sections 101 to 106 of the Evidence Act and \r\n\r\n\r\nobserved:\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Coming   back   to   the   cases   before   us,   we   find   that   the \r\n\r\nHigh   Court   had   correctly   stated   the   grounds   on   which \r\n\r\neven a subjective opinion as to the existence of the need \r\n\r\nto   take   action   under   Section   17(4)   of   the   Act   can   be \r\n\r\nchallenged on certain limited grounds. But, as soon as we \r\n\r\nspeak of a challenge we have to bear in mind the general \r\n\r\nburdens   laid   down   by   Sections   101   and   102   of   the \r\n\r\nEvidence  Act.  It   is  for  the   petitioner  to  substantiate  the \r\n\r\ngrounds of his challenge. This means  that the petitioner \r\n\r\nhas  to either  lead evidence or show  that some  evidence \r\n\r\nhas come from the side of the respondents to indicate that \r\n\r\nhis challenge to a notification or order is made good. If \r\n\r\nhe does not succeed in discharging that duty his petition \r\n\r\nwill fail. But, is that the position in the cases before us? \r\n\r\nWe   find   that,   although   the   High   Court   had   stated   the \r\n\r\nquestion before it to be one which \"narrows down to the \r\n\r\npoint as to the burden of proof\" yet, it had analysed the \r\n\r\nevidence   sufficiently   before   it   to   reach   the   conclusion \r\n\r\nthat   the   urgency   provision   under   Section   17(4)   had   not \r\n\r\nbeen validly resorted to.\r\n\r\n                                              \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n We think that the original or stable onus laid down by \r\n\r\nSection 101 and Section 102 of the Evidence Act cannot \r\n\r\nbe shifted by the use of Section 106 of the Evidence Act, \r\n\r\nalthough   the   particular   onus   of   providing   facts   and \r\n\r\ncircumstances   lying   especially   within   the   knowledge   of \r\n\r\nthe official who formed the opinion which resulted in the \r\n\r\nnotification   under   Section   17   (4)   of   the   Act   rests   upon \r\n\r\nthat   official.   The   recital,   if   it   is   not   defective,   may \r\n\r\nobviate   the   need   to   look   further.   But,   there   may   be \r\n\r\ncircumstances in the case which impel the court to look \r\n\r\nbeyond it. And, at that stage, Section 106 Evidence Act \r\n\r\ncan   be   invoked   by   the   party   assailing   an   order   or \r\n\r\nnotification.   It   is   most   unsafe   in   such   cases   for   the \r\n\r\nofficial or authority concerned to rest content which non-\r\n\r\ndisclosure of facts especially within his or its knowledge \r\n\r\nby relying on the sufficiency of a recital. Such an attitude \r\n\r\nmay itself justify further judicial scrutiny.\r\n\r\n                                              \r\n\r\nIn   the   cases   before   us,   if   the   total   evidence   from \r\n\r\nwhichever side any of it may have come, was insufficient \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            to   enable   the   petitioners   to   discharge   their   general   or \r\n\r\n            stable   onus,   their   petitions   could   not   succeed.   On   the \r\n\r\n            other hand, if, in addition to the bare assertions made by \r\n\r\n            the petitioners, that the urgency contemplated by Section \r\n\r\n            17(4)   did   not   exist,   there   were   other   facts   and \r\n\r\n            circumstances,   including   the   failure   of   the   State   to \r\n\r\n            indicate   facts   and   circumstances   which   it   could   have \r\n\r\n            easily  disclosed  if  they  existed, the petitioners  could be \r\n\r\n            held to have discharged their general onus.\r\n\r\n                                                            \r\n\r\n            It is also clear that, even a technically correct recital in an \r\n\r\n            order or notification stating that the conditions precedent \r\n\r\n            to   the   exercise   of   a   power   have   been   fulfilled   may   not \r\n\r\n            debar   the   court   in   a   given   case   from   considering   the \r\n\r\n            question   whether,   in   fact,   those   conditions   have   been \r\n\r\n            fulfilled.     And,   a   fortiori,   the   court   may   consider   and \r\n\r\n            decide   whether   the   authority   concerned   has   applied   its \r\n\r\n            mind   to   really   relevant   facts   of   a   case   with   a   view   to \r\n\r\n            determining that a condition precedent to the exercise of \r\n\r\n            a   power   has   been   fulfilled.     If   it   appears,   upon   an \r\n\r\n            examination  of  the  totality   of facts   in  the  case,   that  the \r\n\r\n            power conferred has been exercised for an extraneous or \r\n\r\n            irrelevant purpose or that the mind has not been applied \r\n\r\n            at all to the real object or purpose of a power, so that the \r\n\r\n            result is that the exercise of power could only serve some \r\n\r\n            other or collateral object, the court will interfere.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court finally held as under:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            \"There is no indication whatsoever in the \r\n\r\n            affidavit   filed   on   behalf   of   the   State   the   mind   of   the \r\n\r\n            Commissioner was applied at all to the question whether \r\n\r\n            it was a case necessitating the elimination of the enquiry \r\n\r\n            under   Section5A   of   the   Act.   The   recitals   in   the \r\n\r\n            notifications, on the other hand, indicate that elimination \r\n\r\n            of the enquiry under Section 5A of the Act was treated as \r\n\r\n            an automatic consequence of the opinion formed on other \r\n\r\n            matters.  The  recital does not say  at all that any opinion \r\n\r\n            was   formed   on   the   need   to   dispense   with   the   enquiry \r\n\r\n            under   Section   5A   of   the   Act.   It   is   certainly   a   case   in \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               which   the   recital   was   at   least   defective.   The   burden, \r\n\r\n               therefore, rested upon the State to remove the defect, if \r\n\r\n               possible,   by   evidence   to   show   that   some   exceptional \r\n\r\n               circumstances   which   necessitated   the   elimination   of   an \r\n\r\n               enquiry under Section 5A of the Act and that the mind of \r\n\r\n               the Commissioner was applied to this essential question. \r\n\r\n               It seems to us that the High Court correctly   applied the \r\n\r\n               provisions   of  Section   106  of  the   Evidence   Act   to  place \r\n\r\n               the   burden   upon   the   State     to   prove   those   special \r\n\r\n               circumstances,   although   it   also   appears   to   us   that   the \r\n\r\n               High Court was quite correct in stating its view in such a \r\n\r\n               manner as to make it appear that some part of the initial \r\n\r\n               burden of the petitioners  under Sections 101 and 102 of \r\n\r\n               the Evidence Act had been displaced by the failure of the \r\n\r\n               State to discharge  its duty under Section 106 of the Act. \r\n\r\n               The correct way of putting it would have been to say that \r\n\r\n               the failure of the State  to produce the evidence of facts \r\n\r\n               especially   within   the   knowledge   of   its   officials,   which \r\n\r\n               rested   upon   it   under   Section   106   of   the   Evidence   Act, \r\n\r\n               taken together with the attendant facts and circumstances \r\n\r\n               including   the   contents   of   recitals,   had   enabled   the \r\n\r\n               petitioners to discharge  their burden under Sections 101 \r\n\r\n               and 102 of the Evidence Act.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                              (emphasis supplied)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21.     The ratio of the aforesaid judgment was recently followed by the two-\r\n\r\n\r\nJudge  Bench   in  Anand  Singh  v. State  of Uttar  Pradesh  (2010)  11 SCC \r\n\r\n\r\n242.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n22.     We   shall   now   consider   whether   there   was   any   valid   ground   or \r\n\r\n\r\njustification for invoking the urgency provision contained in Section 17(1) \r\n\r\n\r\nand to exclude the application of Section 5A for the acquisition of land for \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplanned   industrial   development   of   the   district.   Sections   4,   5-A   (as \r\n\r\n\r\namended), 6 and 17 of the Act which have bearing on this question read as \r\n\r\n\r\nunder:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               \"4.

Special powers in case of urgency. - (1) In cases of \r\n\r\nurgency   whenever   the   appropriate   Government,   so \r\n\r\ndirects,   the   Collector,   though   no   such   award   has   been \r\n\r\nmade,   may,   on   the   expiration   of   fifteen   days   from   the \r\n\r\npublication   of   the   notice   mentioned   in   section   9,   sub-\r\n\r\nsection   (1)   take   possession   of   any   land   needed   for   a \r\n\r\npublic purpose. Such land shall thereupon vest absolutely \r\n\r\nin the Government, free from all encumbrances.\r\n\r\n\r\n(2)   Whenever,   owing   to   any   sudden   change   in   the \r\n\r\nchannel   of   any   navigable   river   or   other   unforeseen \r\n\r\nemergency,   it   becomes   necessary   for   any   Railway \r\n\r\nAdministration   to   acquire   the   immediate   possession   of \r\n\r\nany   land   for   the   maintenance   of   their   traffic   or   for   the \r\n\r\npurpose of making thereon a river-side or ghat station, or \r\n\r\nof providing convenient connection with or access to any \r\n\r\nsuch station, or the appropriate Government considers it \r\n\r\nnecessary   to   acquire   the   immediate   possession   of   any \r\n\r\nland   for   the   purpose   of   maintaining   any   structure   or \r\n\r\nsystem   pertaining   to   irrigation,   water   supply,   drainage, \r\n\r\nroad   communication   or   electricity,   the   Collector   may, \r\n\r\nimmediately after the publication of the notice mentioned \r\n\r\nin sub-section (1) and with the previous sanction  of the \r\n\r\nappropriate Government, enter upon and take possession \r\n\r\nof such land, which shall thereupon vest absolutely in the \r\n\r\nGovernment free from all encumbrances:\r\n\r\n\r\nProvided   that   the  Collector   shall   not  take   possession   of \r\n\r\nany building or part of a building under this sub-section \r\n\r\nwithout giving to the occupier thereof at least forty-eight \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhours\'   notice   of   his   intention   so   to   do,   or   such   longer \r\n\r\nnotice   as   may   be   reasonably   sufficient   to   enable   such \r\n\r\noccupier   to   remove   his   movable   property   from   such \r\n\r\nbuilding   without   unnecessary   inconvenience.                          \r\n\r\n\r\n(3)   In   every   case   under   either   of   the   preceding   sub-\r\n\r\nsections   the   Collector   shall   at   that   time   of   taking \r\n\r\npossession   offer   to   the   persons   interested   compensation \r\n\r\nfor the standing crops and trees (if any) on such land and \r\n\r\nfrom any other damage sustained by them caused by such \r\n\r\nsudden   dispossession   and   not   excepted   in   section   24; \r\n\r\nand, in case such offer is not accepted, the value of such \r\n\r\ncrops   and   trees   and   the   amount   of   such   other   damage \r\n\r\nshall   be   allowed   for   in   awarding   compensation   for   the \r\n\r\nland under the provisions herein contained. \r\n\r\n\r\n(3A)   Before   taking   possession   of   any   land   under   sub-\r\n\r\nsection (1) or sub-section (2), the Collector shall, without \r\n\r\nprejudice to the provisions of sub-section (3)-\r\n\r\n\r\n(a)     tender   payment   of   eighty   per   centum   of   the \r\n\r\ncompensation   for   such   land   as   estimated   by   him   to   the \r\n\r\npersons interested entitled thereto, and \r\n\r\n\r\n(b)     pay   it   to   them,   unless   prevented   by   some   one   or \r\n\r\nmore of the contingencies mentioned in section 31, sub-\r\n\r\nsection (2), \r\n\r\n\r\nand where the Collector is so prevented, the provisions of \r\n\r\nsection   31,   sub-section   (2),   (except   the   second   proviso \r\n\r\nthereto),   shall   apply   as   they   apply   to   the   payment   of \r\n\r\ncompensation under that section. \r\n\r\n\r\n(3B)   The   amount   paid   or   deposited   under   sub-section \r\n\r\n(3A),   shall   be   taken   into   account   for   determining   the \r\n\r\namount   of   compensation   required   to   be   tendered   under \r\n\r\nsection   31,   and   where   the   amount   so   paid   or   deposited \r\n\r\nexceeds   the   compensation   awarded   by   the   Collector \r\n\r\nunder section 11, the excess may, unless refunded within \r\n\r\nthree   months   from   the   date   of   Collector\'s   award,   be \r\n\r\nrecovered as an arrear of land revenue. \r\n\r\n\r\n(4) In the case of any land to which, in the opinion of the \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                appropriate   Government,   the   provisions   of   sub-section \r\n\r\n                (1)   or   sub-section   (2)   are   applicable,   the   appropriate \r\n\r\n                Government may direct that the provisions of section 5A \r\n\r\n                shall not apply, and, if it does so direct, a declaration may \r\n\r\n                be made under section 6 in respect of the land at any time \r\n\r\n                after the date of the publication of the notification under \r\n\r\n                section 4, sub-section (1).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        Section   17   has   been   amended   five   times   by   the   Uttar   Pradesh \r\n\r\n\r\nlegislature.     However,  the   only   amendment   which   is  relevant   for   deciding \r\n\r\n\r\nthis case is the insertion of proviso to Section 17(4) vide Uttar Pradesh Act \r\n\r\n\r\nNo.8 of 1974.  That proviso reads as under:\r\n\r\n\r\n                \"Provided that where in the case of any land, notification \r\n\r\n                under section 4, sub-section (1) has been published in the \r\n\r\n                Official   Gazette   on   or   after   September   24,   1984   but \r\n\r\n                before   January   11,   1989,   and   the   appropriate \r\n\r\n                Government has under this sub-section directed that the \r\n\r\n                provisions   of   section   5A   shall   not   apply,   a   declaration \r\n\r\n                under section 6 in respect of the land may be made either \r\n\r\n                simultaneously with, or at any time after, the publication \r\n\r\n                in the Official Gazette of the notification under section 4, \r\n\r\n                sub-section (1).\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23.     ANALYSIS OF THE PROVISIONS:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Section   4(1)   lays   down   that   whenever   it   appears   to   the   appropriate \r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment that land in any locality is needed or is likely to be needed for \r\n\r\n\r\nany   public   purpose   or   for   a   company,   then   a   notification   to   that   effect   is \r\n\r\n\r\nrequired to be published in the Official Gazette and two daily newspapers \r\n\r\n\r\nhaving   circulation   in   the   locality.     Of   these,   one   paper   has   to   be   in   the \r\n\r\n\r\nregional language.  A duty is also cast on the Collector, as defined in Section \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3(c), to cause public notice of the substance of such notification to be given \r\n\r\n\r\nat convenient places in the locality.  The last date of publication and giving \r\n\r\n\r\nof   public   notice   is   treated   as   the   date   of   publication   of   the   notification. \r\n\r\n\r\nSection   4(2)   lays   down   that   after   publication   of   the   notification   under \r\n\r\n\r\nSection   4(1),   any   officer   authorised   by   the  Government  in  this   behalf,   his \r\n\r\n\r\nservants or workmen can enter upon and survey and take levels of any land \r\n\r\n\r\nin   the   locality   or to   dig   or   bore   into   the   sub-soil   and   to   do   all   other   acts \r\n\r\n\r\nnecessary for ascertaining that land is suitable for the purpose of acquisition. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe   concerned  officer,  his   servants  or  workmen   can  fix   the  boundaries  of \r\n\r\n\r\nland   proposed   to   be   acquired   and   the   intended   line   of   the   work,   if   any, \r\n\r\n\r\nproposed to be made on it.  They can also mark such levels and boundaries \r\n\r\n\r\nby   marks   and   cutting   trenches   and   cut   down   and   clear   any   part   of   any \r\n\r\n\r\nstanding crops, fence or jungle for the purpose of completing the survey and \r\n\r\n\r\ntaking level, marking of boundaries and line.   However, neither the officer \r\n\r\n\r\nnor his servants or workmen can, without the consent of the occupier, enter \r\n\r\n\r\ninto   any   building   or   upon   any   enclosed   court   or   garden   attached   to   a \r\n\r\n\r\ndwelling house without giving seven days\' notice to the occupier.     Section \r\n\r\n\r\n5A,  which   embodies  the  most   important  dimension  of  the  rules  of  natural \r\n\r\n\r\njustice,   lays   down   that   any   person   interested   in   any   land   notified   under \r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4(1) may, within 30 days of publication of the notification, submit \r\n\r\n\r\nobjection in writing against the proposed acquisition of land or of any land \r\n\r\n\r\nin the locality to the Collector.  The Collector is required to give the objector \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan opportunity of being heard either in person or by any person authorized \r\n\r\n\r\nby him or by pleader.  After hearing the objector (s) and making such further \r\n\r\n\r\ninquiry,   as   he   may   think   necessary,   the   Collector   has   to   make   a   report   in \r\n\r\n\r\nrespect of land notified under Section 4(1) with his recommendations on the \r\n\r\n\r\nobjections and forward the same to the Government along with the record of \r\n\r\n\r\nthe proceedings held by him.   The Collector can make  different reports in \r\n\r\n\r\nrespect of different parcels of land proposed to be acquired.  Upon receipt of \r\n\r\n\r\nthe Collector\'s report, the appropriate Government is required to take action \r\n\r\n\r\nunder Section 6(1) which lays down that after considering the report, if any, \r\n\r\n\r\nmade   under   Section   5-A   (2),   the   appropriate   Government   is   satisfied   that \r\n\r\n\r\nany particular land is needed for a public purpose, then a declaration to that \r\n\r\n\r\neffect   is   required   to   be   made   under   the   signatures   of   a   Secretary   to   the \r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment   or   of   some   officer   duly   authorised   to   certify   its   orders.   This \r\n\r\n\r\nsection also envisages making of different declarations from time to time in \r\n\r\n\r\nrespect of different parcels of land covered by the same notification issued \r\n\r\n\r\nunder   Section   5(1).     In   terms   of  clause   (ii)   of   proviso   to   Section   6(1),   no \r\n\r\n\r\ndeclaration in respect of any particular land covered by a notification issued \r\n\r\n\r\nunder   Section   4(1),   which   is   published   after   24.9.1989   can   be   made   after \r\n\r\n\r\nexpiry of one year from the date of publication of the notification.  To put it \r\n\r\n\r\ndifferently,  a declaration  is required  to be made  under Section  6(1) within \r\n\r\n\r\none year from the date of publication of the notification under Section 4(1). \r\n\r\n\r\nIn   terms   of   Section   6(2),   every   declaration   made   under   Section   6(1)   is \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrequired to be published in the official gazette and in two daily newspapers \r\n\r\n\r\nhaving circulation in the locality in which land proposed to be acquired is \r\n\r\n\r\nsituated.     Of   these,   at   least   one   must   be   in   the   regional   language.     The \r\n\r\n\r\nCollector   is   also   required   to   cause   public   notice   of   the   substance   of   such \r\n\r\n\r\ndeclaration to be given at convenient places in the locality.  The declaration \r\n\r\n\r\nto   be   published   under   Section   6(2)   must   contain   the   district   or   other \r\n\r\n\r\nterritorial   division   in   which   land   is   situate,   the   purpose   for   which   it   is \r\n\r\n\r\nneeded,   its   approximate   area   or  a   plan  is   made   in  respect   of   land  and   the \r\n\r\n\r\nplace where such plan can be inspected.   Section 6 (3) lays down that the \r\n\r\n\r\ndeclaration made under Section 6(1) shall be conclusive evidence of the fact \r\n\r\n\r\nthat land is needed for a public purpose. After publication of the declaration \r\n\r\n\r\nunder   Section   6,   the   Collector   is   required   to   take   order   from   the   State \r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment for the acquisition of land to be carved out and measured and \r\n\r\n\r\nplanned (Sections 7 and 8). The next stage as envisaged is issue of public \r\n\r\n\r\nnotice   and   individual   notice   to   the   persons   interested   in   land   to   file   their \r\n\r\n\r\nclaim for compensation. Section 11 envisages holding of an enquiry into the \r\n\r\n\r\nclaim and passing of an award by the Collector who is required to take into \r\n\r\n\r\nconsideration the provisions contained in Section 23. Section 16 lays down \r\n\r\n\r\nthat after making an award the Collector can take possession of land which \r\n\r\n\r\nshall thereafter  vest in the Government. Section  17(1) postulates taking of \r\n\r\n\r\npossession of land without making an award.  If the appropriate Government \r\n\r\n\r\ndecides   that   land   proposed   to   be   acquired   is   urgently   needed   for   a   public \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npurpose   then   it   can   authorise   the   competent   authority   to   take   possession. \r\n\r\n\r\nSection 17(2) contemplates a different type of urgency in which, the State \r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment   can   authorise   taking   of   possession   even   before   expiry   of   15 \r\n\r\n\r\ndays period specified in Section 9 (1).  Section 17(4) lays down that in cases \r\n\r\n\r\nwhere   appropriate   Government   comes   to   the   conclusion   that   there   is \r\n\r\n\r\nexistence   of   an   urgency   or   unforeseen   emergency,   it   can   direct   that \r\n\r\n\r\nprovisions of Section 5-A shall not apply.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n24.      Before   adverting   to   the   precedents   in   which   Section   5A   has   been \r\n\r\n\r\ninterpreted by this Court, it will be useful to notice development of the law \r\n\r\n\r\nrelating   to   the   rule   of   hearing.   In   the   celebrated   case   of  Cooper   v. \r\n\r\n\r\nWandsworth Board of Works (1863) 143 ER 414, the principle was stated \r\n\r\n\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n\r\n         \"Even God did not pass a sentence upon Adam, before he was \r\n\r\n         called upon to make his defence.  \"Adam\" says God, \"where art \r\n\r\n         thou?     hast   thou   not   eaten   of   the   tree   whereof   I   commanded \r\n\r\n         thee that thou shouldest not eat\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTherein   the   District   Board   had   brought   down   the   house   of   the   plaintiff\'s \r\n\r\n\r\n(Cooper),   because   he   had   failed   to   comply   with   The   Metropolis   Local \r\n\r\n\r\nManagement Act.   The Act required the plaintiff to notify the board seven \r\n\r\n\r\ndays before starting to build the house.  Cooper argued that even though the \r\n\r\n\r\nboard had the legal authority to tear his house down, no person should be \r\n\r\n\r\ndeprived of their property without notice.  In spite of no express words in the \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstatute the court recognized the right of hearing before the plaintiff\'s house \r\n\r\n\r\nbuilt without permission was demolished in the exercise of statutory powers. \r\n\r\n\r\nByles J stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               `Although there are not positive words in a statute \r\n\r\n               requiring   that   the   party   shall   be   heard,   yet   the \r\n\r\n               justice   of   the   common   law   shall   supply   the \r\n\r\n               omission of the legislature\'.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n25.    Perhaps the best known statement on the right to be heard has come \r\n\r\n\r\nfrom Lord Loreburn, L.C. in Board of Education v. Rice (1911 AC 179 at \r\n\r\n\r\n182), where he observed: \r\n\r\n\r\n       \"Comparatively   recent   statutes   have   extended,   if   they   have \r\n\r\n       originated, the practice of imposing upon departments or offices \r\n\r\n       of   State   the   duty   of   deciding   or   determining   questions   of \r\n\r\n       various kindsIn such cases they must act in good faith and \r\n\r\n       fairly listen to both sides, for that is a duty lying upon everyone \r\n\r\n       who   decides   anything.     But   I   do   not   think   they   are   bound   to \r\n\r\n       treat such questions as though it were a trial they can obtain \r\n\r\n       information   in   any   way   they   think   best,   always   giving   a   fair \r\n\r\n       opportunity   to   those   who   are   parties   in   the   controversy   for \r\n\r\n       correcting or contradicting any relevant statement prejudicial in \r\n\r\n       their view.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n26.    In  Ridge   v.   Baldwin  1964   AC   40   Lord   Reid   emphasized   on   the \r\n\r\n\r\nuniversality of the right to a fair hearing whether it concerns the property or \r\n\r\n\r\ntenure   of   an   office   or   membership   of   an   institution.     In  O\'Reilly   v. \r\n\r\n\r\nMackman 1983 2 AC 237, Lord Diplock said that the right of a man to be \r\n\r\n\r\ngiven   a   fair   opportunity   of   hearing,   what   is   alleged   against   him   and   of \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npresenting his own case is so fundamental to any civilized legal system that \r\n\r\n\r\nit is to be presumed that Parliament intended that failure to observe the same \r\n\r\n\r\nshould   render   null   and   void   any   decision   reached   in   breach   of   this \r\n\r\n\r\nrequirement.  In Lloyd v. Mcmahon 1987 AC 625 Lord Bridge said:\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"My   Lords,   the   so-called   rules   of   natural   justice   are   not \r\n\r\n        engraved  on tablets  of  stone.   To  use  the  phrase   which better \r\n\r\n        expresses   the   underlying   concept,   what   the   requirements   of \r\n\r\n        fairness   demand   when   any   body,   domestic,   administrative   or \r\n\r\n        judicial, has to make a decision which will affect the rights of \r\n\r\n        individuals   depends   on   the   character   of   the   decision-making \r\n\r\n        body, the kind of decision it has to make and the statutory or \r\n\r\n        other framework in which it operates. In particular, it is well-\r\n\r\n        established  that when a statute has conferred on any body the \r\n\r\n        power  to make   decisions  affecting  individuals,  the  courts  will \r\n\r\n        not  only  require   the   procedure  prescribed  by  the  statute  to  be \r\n\r\n        followed,   but   will   readily   imply   so   much   and   no   more   to   be \r\n\r\n        introduced  by way of additional procedural  safeguards  as will \r\n\r\n        ensure the attainment of fairness.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n27.     In the United States, principles of natural justice usually find support \r\n\r\n\r\nfrom the Due Process clause of the Constitution.  The extent of due process \r\n\r\n\r\nprotection   required   is   determined   by   a   number   of   factors;   first   the   private \r\n\r\n\r\ninterest   that   will   be   affected   by   the   official   action;   second,   the   risk   of   an \r\n\r\n\r\nerroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the \r\n\r\n\r\nprobable   value,   if   any,   of   additional   or   substitute   procedural   requirement \r\n\r\n\r\nwould entail.  \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n28.    The   amplitude,   ambit   and   width  of   the   rule   of  audi  alteram   partem \r\n\r\n\r\nwas lucidly stated by the three-Judge bench in  Sayeedur Rehman v. State \r\n\r\n\r\nof Bihar (1973) 3 SCC 333 in the following words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               \"11This   unwritten   right   of   hearing   is \r\n\r\n               fundamental   to   a   just   decision   by   any   authority   which \r\n\r\n               decides   a   controversial   issue   affecting   the   rights   of   the \r\n\r\n               rival contestants. This right has its roots in the notion of \r\n\r\n               fair   procedure.   It   draws   the   attention   of   the   party \r\n\r\n               concerned to the imperative necessity of not overlooking \r\n\r\n               the other side of the case before coming to its decision, \r\n\r\n               for   nothing   is   more   likely   to   conduce   to   just   and   right \r\n\r\n               decision   than   the   practice   of   giving   hearing   to   the \r\n\r\n               affected parties.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n29.    In  Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner  (1978) 1 \r\n\r\n\r\nSCC   405,   Krishna   Iyer   J.   speaking   for   himself,   Beg   CJ   and   Bhagwati   J. \r\n\r\n\r\nhighlighted the importance of rule of hearing in the following words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               \"43. Indeed, natural justice is a pervasive facet of secular \r\n\r\n               law   where   a   spiritual   touch   enlivens   legislation, \r\n\r\n               administration and adjudication, to make fairness a creed \r\n\r\n               of life. It has, many colours and shades, many forms and \r\n\r\n               shapes   and,   save   where   valid   law   excludes   it,   applies \r\n\r\n               when   people   are   affected   by   acts   of   authority.   It   is   the \r\n\r\n               hone   of   healthy   government,   recognised   from   earliest \r\n\r\n               times   and   not   a   mystic   testament   of   Judge-made   law. \r\n\r\n               Indeed,   from   the   legendary   days   of   Adam   --   and   of \r\n\r\n               Kautilya\'s  Arthasastra  --   the   rule   of   law   has   had   this \r\n\r\n               stamp of natural justice which makes it social justice. We \r\n\r\n               need   not   go   into   these   deeps   for   the   present   except   to \r\n\r\n               indicate that the roots of natural justice and its foliage are \r\n\r\n               noble and not new-fangled. Today its application must be \r\n\r\n               sustained by current legislation, case-law or other extant \r\n\r\n               principle, not the hoary chords of legend and history. Our \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               jurisprudence has sanctioned its prevalence even like the \r\n\r\n               Anglo-American system.\r\n\r\n                                                                  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n               48.  Once we understand the soul of the rule as fair play \r\n\r\n               in action -- and it is so -- we must hold that it extends to \r\n\r\n               both   the   fields.   After   all,   administrative   power   in   a \r\n\r\n               democratic set-up is not allergic to fairness in action and \r\n\r\n               discretionary   executive   justice   cannot   degenerate   into \r\n\r\n          The High Court was justified in non-suiting the appellants on the ground that they had not raised a specific plea supported by a proper affidavit to question the decision taken by the State Government to invoke Section 17(1) and 17(4) of the Act. There was not any valid ground or justification for invoking the urgency provision contained in Section 17(1) and to exclude the application of Section 5A for the acquisition of land for planned industrial development of the district. The acquisition is primarily meant to cater private interest in the name of industrial development of the district. No evidence has been produced before the Court to show that the State Government and/or agencies/instrumentalities of the State are intending to establish industrial units on the acquired land either by itself or through its agencies/instrumentalities. The Supreme Court observed that even if planned industrial development of the district is treated as public purpose within the meaning of Section 4, there was no urgency which could justify the exercise of power by the State Government under Section 17(1) and 17(4). The private entrepreneurs, who are desirous of making investment in the State, take their own time in setting up the industrial units. Therefore, time required for ensuring compliance of the provisions contained in Section 5-A cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be portrayed as delay which will frustrate the purpose of acquisition and it was held that there was no real and substantive urgency to justify invoking of the urgency provision under Section 17(1) and to exclude the application of Section 5-A. The order of the High Court set aside. The respondents are directed to proceed from the stage of Section 4 notification and take appropriate action after complying with Section 5-A(1) and (2) of the Act. The appeal was allowed. Appeals Allowed','Daya Shankar Vs State Of M.P Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.\n\n\n\n1.    Leave granted.\n\n\n\n2.    Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a Division Bench of the\n\nMadhya Pradesh High Court upholding the conviction of the appellant for\n\noffence punishable under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the Indian\n\nPenal Code, 1860 (in short the `IPC&apos;) as was awarded by learned Additional\n\nSessions Judge, Panna, in Sessions Trial No.15/1992.\n3.    Prosecution version as unfolded during trial is as follows:\n\n\n\n      On 30th November, 1991 at about 5.00 p.m. Ram Kishore (hereinafter\n\nreferred to as the `deceased&apos;) was murdered in an agricultural field. First\n\nInformation Report was lodged by Manik Lal at Police Station, Pawal in the\n\nevening at about 7.00 p.m. Offence was registered as Crime No.124/91\n\nunder Section 302/34 IPC. Deceased had eloped with Lalli, sister of\n\nRamcharan (A-2) and both of them had performed court marriage. The court\n\nmarriage was registered and Lalli was living with Ramkishore. The\n\nappellant was having enmity with deceased on account of aforesaid\n\nincident. Deceased after eloping with Lalli was living in some other village\n\nand returned to his village a month before the incident. Ramkishore had\n\ngone to answer the call of nature in the evening on 30.11.1991 at about 4.30\n\np.m. towards the agricultural field of Gadka. Around 5 p.m. Phulla (A-3)\n\narmed with axe, Ramcharan (A-2) armed with sword alongwith\n\nDayashankar (A-1) and Munni Lal (A-4) went to the field of Gadaka. Munni\n\nLal and Dayashankar were barehanded. Phulla gave axe blow on the head of\n\ndeceased. Thereafter, Dayashankar and Munnilal, the co-accused pulled the\n\nlegs of deceased and threw him on the ground. Ram Kishore fell on the\n\n\n\n \ncrops in the field. Ramcharan assaulted the deceased by sword on the chest.\n\nThen he placed his sword on the chest of the deceased. On account of\n\nbeating he died. Police after receiving information of the commission of\n\ncrime carried out the investigation, arrested the accused persons and filed\n\nthe challan on 3.1.1992 before the Court of Judicial Magistrate. Case was\n\ncommitted to the Court of Sessions Judge. Trial Court framed charges under\n\nSection 302/34 IPC against the accused persons. After recording the\n\nevidence the trial Court convicted the accused persons for offence under\n\nSections 302 read with Section 34 IPC and sentenced them as afore-noted.\n\n\n\n      Before the High Court the basic stand was that the prosecution failed\n\nto prove common intention on the part of the appellants and, therefore,\n\nSection 34 had no application. The individual act of the appellant should\n\nhave been considered. Merely because the appellant had accompanied other\n\naccused persons, that cannot be sufficient to warrant presumption of\n\ncommon intention.\n\n\n\n4.    Learned counsel for the State submitted that the eye witnesses PWs 2\n\nand 3 had described the act of each of the appellants and the role ascribed to\n\nthe appellant was that he pulled the leg of the deceased as a result of which\n\n\n\n \ndeceased fell in the field of Masur crop and thereafter he was assaulted by\n\nother accused persons. The appeal was dismissed accepting the stand of the\n\nState.\n\n\n\n5.       Learned counsel for the appellant re-iterated the stand taken before\n\nthe High Court and submitted that Section 34 IPC has no application.\n\n\n\n6.       Learned counsel for the State on the other hand supported the\n\njudgment.\n\n\n\n7.       Section 34 has been enacted on the principle of joint liability in the\n\ndoing of a criminal act. The Section is only a rule of evidence and does not\n\ncreate a substantive offence. The distinctive feature of the Section is the\n\neleme Indian Penal Code, 1860 - Section 302/34 - Murder- - Conviction and sentence- - Whether calls for obstruction?- - Held, \"yes\"- - Evidence of observers did not credit any clear demonstration to litigant - Mere truth that he was in organization of blamed who were equipped - Not adequate to draw in Section 34- - Appellant not outfitted - He had no ill will with expired - Stand that he pulled leg of perished - Not built up - Not suitable to hold appealing party blameworthy by utilization of Section 34- - His conviction put aside.

Krishnamurthy and R. Gopdlakrishnan, for the appellant.\nH.   R.	 Gokhale,  B.  Subbiah	and  R.	 Thiagaraian,	for,\nrespondents Nos. 2 and 4.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRamaswami,  J. The plaintiff G. Narayana Raju filed O.S.  34\nof  1951-52  in	 the Court of  District	 Judge,	 Mysore	 for\npartition   and	 separate  possession  of  suit	  properties\nmentioned in the various schedules of the plaint.  The first\ndefendant is the brother\n \nof  the	 plaintiff.  The second defendant is  the  widow  of\nMuniswami  Raju, the eldest brother of the  plaintiff.	 The\nthird	defendant  is  the  legal  representative   of	 the\nplaintiffs  mother.  She is now the, appellant	having	been\nbrought	 on  record  as	 the  legal  representative  of	 the\ndeceased  plaintiff. The case of the original plaintiff	 was\nthat he, the first defendant and Muniswami Raju (husband  of\nthe  second defendant) were the sons of one Gopala Raju	 and\nwere all members of the joint family Gopalaraju died in	 May\n1931  and  after his death the plaintiff  and  his  brothers\ncontinued  to  be members of the joint	family.	  The  joint\nstatus	of  the,  family  was severed  by  the	issue  of  a\nregistered notice by the first defendant to the plaintiff in\nJuly 1951.  An ancestral house in Nazar bad belonging to the\nfamily was acquired by the City IuprovementTrust Board in or\nabout the year 1909.  Out of the compensation paid for	that\nhouse and supplemented by the earnings of the members of the\njoint  family, the house item No. I of Schedule &apos;A&apos;  to	 the\nplaint	was  purchased by Gopalaraju in or  about  the	year\n1910.	Subsequently  item No. 2 of Schedule  &apos;A&apos;  was	also\npurchased by Gopalaraju from the income of item No. I supple\nmented	by the earnings of the members of the  family.	 All\nthe other items of properties mentioned in Schedule &apos;A&apos;	 and\nother Schedules attached to the plaint were acquired out  of\nthe  income  from  items 1 and 2 of  Schedule  &apos;A&apos;,  It	 was\nfurther	 alleged that the business known as \"Ambika  Stores\"\nwas  also the joint family business and all  the  properties\nmentioned in the Schedules except items I and 2 of  Schedule\n&apos;A&apos;  were acquired out of the income of the members  of	 the\nfamily	including  the income from the	business  of  Ambika\nStores.	  The plaintiff accordingly claimed that he and	 the\nfirst defendant would each be entitled to get 5/14ths  share\nand  the second and third defendants would each be  entitled\nto  get	 2/14ths. share.  In the alternative  the  plaintiff\npleaded	 that  if  for any reason the Court  held  that	 the\nproperties stand in the name of Muniswami Raju and were	 not\nacquired with the aidof the joint familv nucleus, he and the\nsecond defendant were entitled to equal shares as  co-owners\nof the joint family business.  The suit was mainly contested\nby  the	 second defendant who asserted that  the  properties\nmentioned  in  all the Schedules of the	 plaint	 were  self-\nacquisitions of Miiniswami Raju and constituted his separate\nproperties.  It was alleged that Muniswami Raju was the only\ncarniiig member of the family at the time of the acquisition\nof items 1 and 2 of Schedule operties and the plaintiff	 and\nthe  first defendant were emploved,in petty jobs  in  Wesley\nPress.	 Muniswami Raju later on employed the  plaintiff  in\nhis  -shop  as	a salaried servant and	the  latter  had  no\nproprietary  right in the business of Ambika Stores.   After\nconsideration  of  the	oral and  documentary  evidence	 the\nDistrict Judge held that the plaintiff, first defendant	 and\nMuniswami  Raju were not divided and that the only  property\nwhich was divisible was item No. I of Schedule\n \n&apos;A&apos;  and  there	 was not sufficient  ancestral	nucleus	 for\nacquisition of the other properties and that all  properties\nexcept item No. 1 of Schedule &apos;A were the self	acquisitions\nof  Muniswami Raju, that Muniswami I Raju never blended	 his\nproperties with that of the joint family that the  plaintiff\nwas  only an employee under Muniswami Raju and therefore  he\nwas not entitled to the alternativ &apos; relief claimed by	him.\nAccordingly, the District Judge granted a preliminary decree\nholding	 that the plaintiff was entitled to 2/7ths share  in\nitem  No. I of Schedule &apos;A&apos;.  The plaintiff took the  matter\nin  appeal to the Mysore High Court.  By its judgment  dated\nMarch  25,  1960 the High Court affirmed the decree  of	 the\ntrial court with the modification that besides item No. I of\nSchedule  &apos;A&apos;  item No. 2 also should be hold  to  be  joint\nfamily property and the plaintiff was entitled to  partition\nof  his share in this item also.  The High  Court  cancelled\nthe  I	direction of the District Judge that  the  plaintiff\nshould	account for the moneys and properties  of  Muniswami\nRaju  -in  his hands before he is given	 possession  of	 his\nshare.\nThis  appeal  is  brought by certificate on  behalf  of	 the\nplaintiff  from the judgment of the Mysore High Court  dated\nMarch 25, 1960 in R.A. No. 155 of 1953.\nThe  first  question  to be considered	in  this  appeal  is\nwhether	 the  business	of  Ambika  Stores  was	 really	 the\nbusiness  of the joint family and whether the plaintiff	 was\nentitled. to a partition of his share in the assets of	that\nbusiness.: It was contended on behalf of the appellant	that\nthe  business of Ambika Stores grew out of a nucleus of	 the\njoint family funds of at least by the efforts of the members\nof  the joint family include the appellant.  The  contention\nof the appellant has been negatived by both the lower courts\nand there is a concurrent finding that the Ambika Stores was\nthe  separate business of Muniswami Raju and it was  neither\nthe  joint  family  business nor  treated  as  joint  family\nbusiness, It is wellestablished that there is no presumption\nunder Hindu law that a business standing in the name of	 any\nmember	of the joint family is a joint family business	even\nif that member is the manager, of the joint family.  Unless,\nit  could  be shown that the business in the  hands  of	 the\ncoparcener  grew up with the assistance of the joint  family\nproperty  or joint family funds or that the earnings of	 the\nbusiness  were	blended with the joint	family	estate,	 the\nbusiness remains free and separate.  The question  therefore\nwhether	 the  business	was begun or  carried  on  with	 the\nassistance of joint family property or joint family funds or\nas  a  -family	business is a  question	 of  fact.-(See	 the\ndecisions of the Judicial Committee in Bhwu Mal v. Jagannath\n(1)  and in Pearey Lal v. Nanak Chand (1) and of this  Court\nin Chattahatha Karayalar v. Ramachandra\n(1)   A.T.R 1943 P.C 40.\n(2)   A.T.R. 1948 P.C  108.\n \nlyer)  (1).   In  the present, case there  is  a  concurrent\nfinding of both the lower courts that the business of Ambika\nStores	was a separate, business of Muniswami Raju  and	 it,\nwas  neither  a joint family business nor treated  as  joint\nfamily business.  The concurrent finding of the lower courts\non  this issue is upon a finding of fact and  following	 the\nusual practice of this Court, it is not now open to  further\nscrutiny by this Court under Art. 133 of the Constitution.\nIt  was, however, contended on behalf of the appellant	that\nthe finding of the lower. courts is vitiated in, law because\nof  the circumstance that they have not taken  into  account\nthree important documents, Ex.	D, Ex.	E and Ex.  DDD.	  We\nare  unable  to	 accept this argument  as  correct.   It  is\nmanifest on a perusal of the judgment of the High Court that\nall  the documents have been examined, regarding  the  issue\nwhether	 the  business of Ambika Stores was a  joint  family\nbusiness  or whether it was p. separate, business  of  Muni-\nswami  Raju.  As regards Ex.  D, the High-,Court has,  after\nexamining the evidence adduced, remarked that the, mere fact\nthat  item No. 2 of Schedule &apos;A was given as a	security  by\nMuniswami Raju did not result in any detriment to the  joint\nfamily	property and, it cannot therefore be held  that	 the\nbusiness of Ambika Stores grew out of the joint family funds\nor with the aid of the joint family funds.  On behalf of the\nappellant  reliance was placed on the recitals in Ex.  E,  a\ndeed of mortgage dated July 26, 1928 executed by Gopalaraju,\nMuniswamiraju  and  the appellant in favour  of	 the  Mysore\nBank.	The  property  that had been  mortgaged	 under	this\ndocument is item No. 2 of Schedule &apos;A&apos;.	 The recital is that\nthe  borrowing from the Bank was for the business and  trade\nof  the	 executants and -for the benefit and  use  of  their\nfamily.	  There is also a recital in an earlier	 portion  of\nthe document that the business, was being carried on for the\nbenefit	 of  the  family, but it is not quite  clear  as  to\nwhether this related to the business carried on by  Narayana\nRaju  or whether it was intended to relate to some  business\ncarried on by all the three executants.	 It is possible that\nthe  appellant had other business of his own carried on	 -on\nhis own. account at that time and it cannot be, assumed that\nthe borrowing under Ex.	 E must have been for the purpose of\nAmbika	Stores.	 It should be noticed that  Muniswarni	Raju\nhas  been  described in the document as	 the  proprietor  of\nAmbika Stores which description is. not consistent with	 the\ncontention  of the appellant that the business, was a  joint\nfamily	business.  The High Court has, in  this	 connection,\nreferred  to Ex.  I an application dated February 14,  1929,\nby  the	 appellant  to the City	 Co-operative  Bank,  Mysore\nwherein, the appellant has said that he was getting a decent\nearning	 by  doing;  out-of-door  commercial  business	with\nAmbika	Stores.	 There is also the, recital in Ex.   I	that\nMuniswami Raju was the proprietor of Ambika Stores.   Having\nregard to this recital in I it is not-\n(1)  A.I.R. 1955 S.C. 799.\n \nunlikely that the appellant had some business of his own  at\nthe  material time and it cannot be assumed  that  borrowing\nunder Ex.  E, was for the purpose of Ambika Stores  business\nonly.  The High Court has also dealt with the effect of	 Ex.\nDDD, mortgage deed produced on behalf of the appellant.	  It\nis  true that in this document the appellant  and  Muniswami\nRaju  have been described as proprietors of  Ambika  Stores.\nThe finding of the High Court is that this recital was	made\nin the document for the purposes of borrowing from the Bank.\nReference was made in this context to a letter dated May  5,\n1931,  Ex.  75 written by Muniswami Raju  as  proprietor  of\nAmbika	Stores to the Bank of Mysore.  In&apos; this	 letter,  he\nhas requested the Bank to take note of the fact that he	 has\nauthorised the appellant to accept drafts, and sign  letters\netc. on behalf of the firm&apos; There is another Letter, Ex. 76,\ndated  April 14, 1934 written by Muniswami Raju to the	Bank\nof  Mysore wherein Muniswami Raju has been described as	 the\nproprietor  of Ambika Stores and there is an  intimation  to\nthe Bank, that the appellant Narayana Raju was authorised to\nsign  for the firm.  In the context and background of  these\ncircumstances  it is evident that though both the  appellant\nand  Muniswami Raju were described as proprietors of  Ambika\nStores the description was only for the purpose of borrowing\nmoney  from the Bank, as contended for by  the	respondents.\nIn  this  connection  the High Court  has  also	 taken	into\naccount Ex. 7 5 (b), a letter written by Muniswami Raju.  In\nthis  letter  Muniswami Raju has described  himself  as	 the\nproprietor of Ambika Stores and has instructed the Bank that\nhe   The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Ramaswami, J. The plaintiff G. Narayana Raju filed O.S. 34 of 1951-52 in the Court of District Judge, Mysore for partition and separate possession of suit properties mentioned in the various schedules of the plaint. The first defendant is the brother of the plaintiff. The second defendant is the widow of Muniswami Raju, the eldest brother of the plaintiff. The third defendant is the legal representative of the plaintiffs mother. She is now the, appellant having been brought on record as the legal representative of the deceased plaintiff. The case of the original plaintiff was that he, the first defendant and Muniswami Raju (husband of the second defendant) were the sons of one Gopala Raju and were all members of the joint family Gopalaraju died in May 1931 and after his death the plaintiff and his brothers continued to be members of the joint family. The joint status of the, family was severed by the issue of a registered notice by the first defendant to the plaintiff in July 1951. An ancestral house in Nazar bad belonging to the family was acquired by the City IuprovementTrust Board in or about the year 1909. Out of the compensation paid for that house and supplemented by the earnings of the members of the joint family, the house item No. I of Schedule \'A\' to the plaint was purchased by Gopalaraju in or about the year 1910. Subsequently item No. 2 of Schedule \'A\' was also purchased by Gopalaraju from the income of item No. I supple mented by the earnings of the members of the family. All the other items of properties mentioned in Schedule \'A\' and other Schedules attached to the plaint were acquired out of the income from items 1 and 2 of Schedule \'A\', It was further alleged that the business known as \"Ambika Stores\" was also the joint family business and all the properties mentioned in the Schedules except items I and 2 of Schedule \'A\' were acquired out of the income of the members of the family including the income from the business of Ambika Stores. The plaintiff accordingly claimed that he and the first defendant would each be entitled to get 5/14ths share and the second and third defendants would each be entitled to get 2/14ths. share. In the alternative the plaintiff pleaded that if for any reason the Court held that the properties stand in the name of Muniswami Raju and were not acquired with the aidof the joint familv nucleus, he and the second defendant were entitled to equal shares as co-owners of the joint family business. The suit was mainly contested by the second defendant who asserted that the properties mentioned in all the Schedules of the plaint were self- acquisitions of Miiniswami Raju and constituted his separate properties. It was alleged that Muniswami Raju was the only carniiig member of the family at the time of the acquisition of items 1 and 2 of Schedule operties and the plaintiff and the first defendant were emploved,in petty jobs in Wesley Press. Muniswami Raju later on employed the plaintiff in his -shop as a salaried servant and the latter had no proprietary right in the business of Ambika Stores. After consideration of the oral and documentary evidence the District Judge held that the plaintiff, first defendant and Muniswami Raju were not divided and that the only property which was divisible was item No. I of Schedule \'A\' and there was not sufficient ancestral nucleus for acquisition of the other properties and that all properties except item No. 1 of Schedule \'A were the self acquisitions of Muniswami Raju, that Muniswami I Raju never blended his properties with that of the joint family that the plaintiff was only an employee under Muniswami Raju and therefore he was not entitled to the alternativ \' relief claimed by him. Accordingly, the District Judge granted a preliminary decree holding that the plaintiff was entitled to 2/7ths share in item No. I of Schedule \'A\'. The plaintiff took the matter in appeal to the Mysore High Court. By its judgment dated March 25, 1960 the High Court affirmed the decree of the trial court with the modification that besides item No. I of Schedule \'A\' item No. 2 also should be hold to be joint family property and the plaintiff was entitled to partition of his share in this item also. The High Court cancelled the I direction of the District Judge that the plaintiff should account for the moneys and properties of Muniswami Raju -in his hands before he is given possession of his share.\r\n\r\n\r\nheld:  the appellant during Muniswami Raju\'s life-time of his being a co-owner of the partnership business, nor is there any evidence of recognition by Muniswami Raju of any such right of the appellant. On the other hand, there is sufficient evidence to show that whatever the appellant did in connection with the business was only done with the Authority conferd by Muniswami Raju. In our opinion the High Court has rightly rejected the claim of the appellant that he was a co-owner of the partnership business.\r\n\r\ncourt  the reason expressed we hold that this appeal has no merit and it must be dismissed with costs.\r\n\r\n Appeal was dismissed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ','Rathnavathi & Anr Vs Kavita Ganashamdas Abhay Manohar Sapre, J.\r\n\r\n1.    Leave granted.\r\n\r\n2.    The plaintiff  filed  two  suits,  one  for  specific  performance  of\r\nagreement and other for grant of permanent injunction  in  relation  to  the\r\nsuit  house.  The  trial  court  vide  common  judgment  and  decree   dated\r\n16.10.2001 dismissed both the suits. The first appellate  court,  i.e.,  the\r\nHigh Court, in appeal, by impugned  judgment  and  decree  dated  08.09.2011\r\nreversed the judgment and decree of the trial court  and  decreed  both  the\r\nsuits in appeal, against the defendants.  Being aggrieved  by  the  judgment\r\nand decree of the High Court, Defendants 1 and 3 have approached this  Court\r\nin the instant civil appeals.\r\n3.    The question arises for consideration in these appeals is whether  the\r\nHigh Court was justified in allowing the  first  appeals  preferred  by  the\r\nplaintiff, resulting in decreeing the two civil suits against defendants  in\r\nrelation to suit house?\r\n4.    In order to appreciate the controversy involved in  the  civil  suits,\r\nand now in these appeals, it is necessary to state the relevant facts.\r\n5.    For the sake of convenience, description of parties  herein  is  taken\r\nfrom Original Suit No.223/2000.\r\n6.    Defendant no.2 is the original owner of the suit house  and  defendant\r\nno.1 is the subsequent purchaser of the suit house from defendant no.2.\r\n7.    The dispute relates to a dwelling house bearing no. 351  Block  no.11,\r\nMatadahalli Extension,  now  known  as  R.T.  Nagar  Bangalore  (hereinafter\r\nreferred to as \" the suit house    ).\r\n8.    The suit house  was  purchased  by  defendant  no.  2  from  Bangalore\r\nDevelopment  Authority  (in  short     BDA   )  in  a  scheme.   On  15.02.1989,\r\nDefendant no. 2 entered into an agreement (Annexure-P-1) with plaintiff  for\r\nsale of suit house at a total consideration of Rs. 3,50,000/-. In  terms  of\r\nclause 2 of the agreement, the plaintiff paid  a  sum  of  Rs.  50,000/-  as\r\nadvance towards sale consideration. These facts are not in dispute.\r\n9.    On  07.01.2000,  the  plaintiff  filed  a  civil  suit  being  OS  No.\r\n223/2000, initially against 3 defendants for  seeking  permanent  injunction\r\nrestraining  the  defendants  jointly  and  severally  from  interfering  in\r\nplaintiff\'s possession over the  suit  house.  In  substance,  case  of  the\r\nplaintiff was  that  she  entered  into  an  agreement  on  15.02.1989  with\r\ndefendant no. 2 to purchase the suit house for Rs.  3,50,000/-  and  paid  a\r\nsum of Rs. 50,000/- to defendant no. 2 by way of advance  towards  the  sale\r\nconsideration. Later, the plaintiff further paid the  balance  consideration\r\nof Rs. 3 Lacs towards the sale price  and  obtained  receipts  acknowledging\r\nthe payment so made. It was  alleged  that  the  plaintiff  was  accordingly\r\nplaced in actual physical possession of the suit house and  since  then  she\r\nhas been in possession of the suit house. It was alleged that she also  made\r\nsome improvements therein by spending money and is  paying  electricity  and\r\nwater charges etc. It was further alleged that the  plaintiff  was  and  has\r\nalways been ready and willing to perform her part of the  agreement  to  get\r\nthe sale deed executed in her favour after having performed her part of  the\r\ncontract. However, defendant no. 2, for the reasons best known to  her,  did\r\nnot  execute  the  sale  deed  despite  having  received   the   full   sale\r\nconsideration from the plaintiff. It was alleged that defendant no.  1,  who\r\nis a total stranger to the  suit  house  and  having  no  right,  title  and\r\ninterest in the suit house, on 2.1.2000 visited the suit  house  along  with\r\ndefendant no.  2  and  some  other  unwanted  elements  and  threatened  the\r\nplaintiff to dispossess her from the suit house. It was  also  alleged  that\r\non 8.1.2000, defendant nos. 1 and 2 again visited and attempted  to  assault\r\nthe plaintiff and unsuccessfully attempted to commit trespass  in  the  suit\r\nhouse.\r\n10.   On seeing the hostile attitude of defendant nos. 1  and  2  and  their\r\nassociates, the plaintiff immediately lodged a complaint  in  the  concerned\r\npolice station. Since police authorities did not take any action, which  was\r\nrequired of, the plaintiff filed the  aforesaid  civil  suit  for  permanent\r\ninjunction restraining the  defendants  from  interfering  in  her  peaceful\r\npossession over the suit house. It was submitted that the  plaintiff  has  a\r\nprima facie case, so also the balance of convenience  and  irreparable  loss\r\nin her favour, which entitles her to claim permanent injunction against  the\r\ndefendants in relation to the suit house. The plaintiff  also  averred  that\r\nshe reserved her right to file a suit for specific performance of  agreement\r\nagainst the defendants.\r\n11.   The aforesaid suit was contested by defendant nos.  1  and  2.   While\r\nadmitting the ownership of defendant no. 2 over the suit house and the  fact\r\nof entering into an agreement  with  the  plaintiff  for  its  sale  to  the\r\nplaintiff and further while admitting the receipt of advance payment  of  Rs\r\n50,000/- from the plaintiff, the defendants denied all material  allegations\r\nmade in the plaint. It was alleged  that  the  plaintiff  did  not  pay  the\r\nbalance consideration as alleged. It was also alleged that defendant  no.  2\r\non 25.10.1995 cancelled the agreement dt 15.02.1989 by sending legal  notice\r\nto the plaintiff and then  sold  the  suit  house  to  defendant  no.  1  on\r\n09.02.1998 for Rs. 4 lacs and placed her in its possession.\r\n12.   On 31.03.2000, the plaintiff filed another civil  suit  being  OS  No.\r\n2334 of 2000 in  the  Court  of  City  Civil  Judge  Bangalore  against  the\r\ndefendants  for  specific  performance  of  agreement  dated  15.02.1989  in\r\nrelation to the suit house.\r\n13.   After pleading the same facts, which are set out above, the  plaintiff\r\nfurther alleged that she has performed her part of the agreement  by  paying\r\nentire sale consideration of Rs. 3,50,000/- and has been  in  possession  of\r\nthe suit house. It was alleged that  on  the  one  hand,  defendant  no.  2,\r\ndespite having received full sale consideration, did not  perform  her  part\r\nof the agreement by not getting the suit house  transferred  in  plaintiff\'s\r\nfavour as per clause 3 of the agreement and by doing the acts which she  was\r\nexpected to do in terms of agreement,  and  on  the  other  hand,  tried  to\r\ninterfere in plaintiff\'s lawful possession over the suit house.\r\n14.   This led the plaintiff to serve upon defendant  no.2  a  legal  notice\r\ndated 6.3.2000 thereby calling upon defendant no.2 to execute the sale  deed\r\nin relation to suit property in plaintiff\'s favour.  Since  despite  service\r\nof legal notice, defendant no. 2  failed  to  execute  the  same,  suit  for\r\nspecific performance was also filed. The plaintiff then by way of  amendment\r\nalso sought to add one prayer for cancellation of sale deed alleged to  have\r\nbeen executed by defendant  no.  2  in  favour  of  defendant  no.  1.  This\r\namendment was allowed.\r\n15.    The  defendants  contested  the  civil  suit.  While  admitting   the\r\nexecution of agreement dated 15.02.1989 with the plaintiff for sale of  suit\r\nhouse for Rs. 3,50,000/- and also admitting payment of Rs. 50,000/-  by  the\r\nplaintiff to defendant no. 2,  the  defendants  denied  all  other  material\r\nallegations and inter alia alleged that since the plaintiff  failed  to  pay\r\nthe balance sale consideration of Rs. 3 lacs to defendant no. 2 in terms  of\r\nthe agreement, defendant no. 2 on 25.10.1995 sent  a  legal  notice  to  the\r\nplaintiff cancelling the agreement dated 15.2.1989 and sold the  suit  house\r\nto defendant no. 1  on  09.02.1998  for  consideration  and  placed  her  in\r\npossession of the suit house. The defendants  also  alleged  that  defendant\r\nno. 1 was the bona fide purchaser for value and hence her  title  cannot  be\r\nquestioned in the suit.\r\n16.   The defendants also contested the suit on two legal grounds.  Firstly,\r\nit was contended that the suit was not maintainable, as  the  bar  contained\r\nin Order II Rule 2 of Code of Civil Procedure,  1908  (hereinafter  referred\r\nto as \'CPC\') did not permit the plaintiff to  file  the  suit  for  specific\r\nperformance of agreement in question against the defendants. It was  alleged\r\nthat relief to claim specific performance of agreement was available to  the\r\nplaintiff when she filed the first suit  (OS  No.  223/2000)  for  permanent\r\ninjunction against the defendants. Yet, the plaintiff failed  to  claim  the\r\nrelief in the first suit, consequently,  the  second  suit  filed  to  claim\r\nspecific performance of agreement in question is hit by rigor  contained  in\r\nOrder II Rule 2 of CPC. It is now barred and hence liable  to  be  dismissed\r\nas not maintainable. Secondly, it was contended that the suit  is  otherwise\r\nbarred by limitation having been filed beyond  the  period  of  three  years\r\nfrom the date of accrual of cause of action as provided  in  Article  54  of\r\nthe Limitation Act, 1963. It was, therefore,  contended  that  the  suit  is\r\nliable to be dismissed as being barred by limitation, as well.\r\n17.   The trial court consolidated both the suits  for  trial.  Issues  were\r\nframed. Parties adduced  evidence.  The  trial  court  vide  judgment/decree\r\ndated 25.8.2009 though  answered  some  issues  in  plaintiff\'s  favour  but\r\neventually dismissed the civil suits. It was held that the  agreement  dated\r\n15.02.1989 was executed between the plaintiff and defendant no. 2  for  sale\r\nof suit house; that the plaintiff was  not  placed  in  possession  of  suit\r\nhouse pursuant to agreement in question; that the plaintiff  was  not  ready\r\nand willing to perform her part of the agreement; that  suit  is  barred  by\r\nlimitation; that the plaintiff was not entitled  to  claim  the  relief  for\r\nspecific performance of agreement; that the plaintiff was  not  entitled  to\r\nclaim the relief for grant of permanent injunction; that defendant no. 1  is\r\na bona fide purchaser of the suit house for value;  that the  plaintiff  was\r\nnot entitled to challenge the sale deed dt. 9.2.1998, that the suit was  hit\r\nby the bar contained in Order II Rule 2 of CPC  because  the  plaintiff  did\r\nnot obtain leave to file second suit for specific performance  while  filing\r\nthe first suit for grant of permanent injunction against the  defendants  in\r\nrelation to the suit house.\r\n18.   Feeling aggrieved, the  plaintiff  filed  two  regular  first  appeals\r\nbeing R.F.A. Nos. 1092 of 2009 and 1094 of 2009 before the  High  Court.  By\r\ncommon impugned judgment/decree, the High Court allowed  both  the  appeals,\r\nreversed the judgment/decree of the trial court and decreed both  the  civil\r\nsuits by passing a decree for specific performance of agreement against  the\r\ndefendants in relation to suit house and also  issued  permanent  injunction\r\nas claimed by the plaintiff. The High Court answered all the  aforementioned\r\nissues in plaintiff\'s favour and against the defendants.\r\n19.   The High Court  in  its  judgment  held  that  the  plaintiff  was  in\r\npossession of suit house; that the  plaintiff  performed  her  part  of  the\r\nagreement; that the plaintiff paid the  entire  sale  consideration  of  Rs.\r\n3,50,000/- to defendant no. 2; that the plaintiff was ready and  willing  to\r\nperform her part of agreement; that defendant no. 2 failed  to  perform  her\r\npart of the agreement thereby rendering her liable to perform  her  part  of\r\nagreement; and that subsequent sale even if  made  by  defendant  no.  2  in\r\nfavour of defendant no. 1 was not binding on the plaintiff  because  it  was\r\nnot bona fide.\r\n20.   The High Court, however, after deciding the issues in  favour  of  the\r\nplaintiff, directed that in order to weigh the equities between the  parties\r\nand keeping in view the price escalation, which is  unavoidable  in  present\r\ndays, the plaintiff will pay an additional sum of Rs. 4 lacs over and  above\r\nRs. 3,50,000/- to defendant no. 2 for obtaining sale deed in her favour.\r\n\r\n 21.  It is against this judgment/decree of the High Court,  the  defendants\r\nhave filed the present appeals by way of special leave petitions.\r\n22.   Mrs. Nalini Chidambaram, learned  Senior  Counsel  appearing  for  the\r\nappellants (defendants) while assailing the legality and correctness of  the\r\nimpugned judgment urged various submissions. Firstly, she  argued  that  the\r\nHigh Court erred in allowing plaintiff\'s  first  appeals,  as  according  to\r\nher, both the appeals were liable to be dismissed by upholding the  judgment\r\n/decree of the trial court which had rightly dismissed the suits.  Secondly,\r\nshe argued that second suit filed for claiming specific performance  of  the\r\nagreement for sale of suit house to the plaintiff was hit by  bar  contained\r\nin Order II Rule 2 of CPC for  the  reason  that  the  plaintiff  failed  to\r\nsecure leave in her first suit and  hence  the  second  suit  filed  by  the\r\nplaintiff for grant of specific performance was not  maintainable.  Thirdly,\r\nshe argued that assuming the second suit was held  maintainable,  even  then\r\nit was barred by limitation prescribed in Article 54 of the Limitation  Act.\r\nIt was  pointed  out  that  cause  of  action  to  file  suit  for  specific\r\nperformance of contract against  the  defendants  arose  in  the  year  1989\r\nitself no sooner 60 days period  expired  from  the  date  of  agreement  as\r\nprovided in clause 2  of  the  agreement,  whereas,  the  suit  in  question\r\nseeking specific performance was filed  in  year  2000  and  hence,  it  was\r\nhopelessly  barred  applying  the  limitation  prescribed  in  Article   54.\r\nFourthly, it was argued that in any case, there was  no  case  made  out  on\r\nevidence by the plaintiff for reversal of the findings relating to grant  of\r\nspecific performance of agreement because the plaintiff  was  neither  ready\r\nnor willing to perform her part of the  agreement  and  nor  there  was  any\r\nevidence to hold in her favour on this material issue. Fifthly,  she  argued\r\nthat there was no evidence to hold that the plaintiff was in  possession  of\r\nthe suit house; rather there was enough evidence to hold that after sale  of\r\nsuit house by defendant no.2 to defendant no.1, it was defendant  no.1,  who\r\nwas in possession. Therefore, it should have been held  that  the  plaintiff\r\nwas not in possession of the suit house, as was rightly held  by  the  trial\r\ncourt. And, lastly she argued that it should have been held with the aid  of\r\nevidence that defendant no. 1 was bona fide purchaser of the suit house  for\r\nvalue, as she purchased it after the owner i.e. defendant  no.  2  cancelled\r\nthe agreement dt 15.2.1989 and then sold the suit house to defendant no.  1.\r\n\r\n23.   After arguing  at  length  with  reference  to  documents  on  record,\r\nlearned counsel for the appellants contended that impugned judgment  /decree\r\ndeserves to be set aside  and  that  of  the  trial  court  be  restored  by\r\ndismissing both the suits filed  by  the  plaintiff.  Learned  counsel  also\r\nrelied upon certain decisions, which we shall refer later.\r\n24.   Mr. P. Vishwanatha Shetty, learned senior counsel for  the  respondent\r\n(plaintiff) supported the impugned judgment /decree and  contended  that  it\r\ndoes not call for any interference. According  to  learned  senior  counsel,\r\nall the findings recorded by the High Court, though of reversal, deserve  to\r\nbe upheld because the High Court, in exercise of its first appellate  powers\r\nunder Section 96 of CPC, rightly appreciated the evidence and  came  to  its\r\nindependent conclusion which it could legally do and which  it  rightly  did\r\nwhile allowing the two first appeals.  Learned  senior  counsel  urged  that\r\nthis Court  while  hearing  these  appeals  cannot  and  rather  should  not\r\nundertake the exercise of appreciating the whole evidence  again  like  that\r\nof the first appeal except to find out whether there is any  apparent  legal\r\nerror in the impugned judgment so as to call for any  interference  by  this\r\nCourt. Learned senior counsel submitted that no such  error  exists  in  the\r\nimpugned judgment and hence these appeals are liable to be dismissed.\r\n25.   Having heard the learned counsel for the parties at  length  and  upon\r\nperusal of the record of the case, we find no merit in these appeals  as  in\r\nour considered opinion, the submissions urged by the learned senior  counsel\r\nfor the appellants, though argued ably, have no force.\r\n26.   Coming first to the legal question as  to  whether  bar  contained  in\r\nOrder II Rule 2 of CPC is attracted so as to non- suit  the  plaintiff  from\r\nfiling  the  suit  for  specific  performance  of  the  agreement,  in   our\r\nconsidered opinion, the bar is not attracted\r\n27.   At the outset, we consider it apposite to take note of law  laid  down\r\nby the Constitution bench of this Court in Gurbux Singh  v.  Bhooralal,  AIR\r\n1964 SC 1810, wherein this Court while explaining the true  scope  of  Order\r\nII Rule  2  of  CPC  laid  down  the  parameters  as  to  how  and  in  what\r\ncircumstances, a plea should be  invoked  against  the  plaintiff.   Justice\r\nAyyangar speaking for the Bench held as under:\r\n   In order that a plea of a  bar  under  Order  2  Rule  2(3)  of  the  Civil\r\nProcedure Code should succeed the defendant who raises the  plea  must  make\r\nout (1) that the second suit was in respect of the same cause of  action  as\r\nthat on which the previous suit was based;  (2)  that  in  respect  of  that\r\ncause of action the plaintiff was entitled to more than one relief;  (3)that\r\nbeing thus entitled to more than one relief  the  plaintiff,  without  leave\r\nobtained from the Court omitted to sue for the relief for which  the  second\r\nsuit had been filed. From this analysis it would be seen that the  defendant\r\nwould have to establish primarily and to start with, the  precise  cause  of\r\naction upon which the previous suit was filed, for unless there is  identity\r\nbetween the cause of action on which the earlier suit was filed and that  on\r\nwhich the claim in the later suit is based there would be no scope  for  the\r\napplication of the bar      \r\n                                   (Emphasis supplied)\r\n\r\n28.   This Court has consistently followed the aforesaid enunciation of  law\r\nin later years and reference to only one of such recent decisions  in  Virgo\r\nIndustries (Eng.) P. Ltd. Vs Venturetech Solutions P.  Ltd.,  (2013)  1  SCC\r\n625, would suffice, wherein this Court reiterated the principle  of  law  in\r\nfollowing words:\r\n   The cardinal requirement for application of  the  provisions  contained  in\r\nOrder II Rules 2(2) and (3), therefore, is that the cause of action  in  the\r\nlater suit must be the same  as  in  the  first  suit.  It  will  be  wholly\r\nunnecessary to enter into any discourse on the  true  meaning  of  the  said\r\nexpression, i.e. cause  of  action,  particularly,  in  view  of  the  clear\r\nenunciation in a recent judgment of this  Court  in  the  Church  of  Christ\r\nCharitable Trust and Educational  Charitable  Society,  represented  by  its\r\nChairman   v.   Ponniamman   Educational   Trust    represented    by    its\r\nChairperson/Managing Trustee  JT  2012  (6)  SC  149.  The  huge  number  of\r\nopinions  rendered  on  the  issue  including  the  judicial  pronouncements\r\navailable does not fundamentally detract from what is stated  in  Halsbury\'s\r\nLaws of England, (4th Edition). The following reference from the above  work\r\nwould, therefore, be apt for being extracted herein below:\r\n\r\n       Cause of Action    has been defined as meaning simply a  factual  situation\r\nexistence of which entitles one person to obtain from  the  Court  a  remedy\r\nagainst another person. The phrase has been held from the earliest  time  to\r\ninclude every fact which is material to be proved to entitle  the  Plaintiff\r\nto succeed, and  every  fact  which  a  Defendant  would  have  a  right  to\r\ntraverse. \'Cause of action    has also been  taken  to  mean  that  particular\r\naction on the part of the Defendant which gives the Plaintiff his  cause  of\r\ncomplaint, or the subject-matter  of  grievance  founding  the  action,  not\r\nmerely the technical cause of action.   \r\n\r\n29.   In the instant case when we apply  the  aforementioned  principle,  we\r\nfind that bar contained in Order II Rule 2 is not attracted because  of  the\r\ndistinction in the cause of action for filing the two suits. So far  as  the\r\nsuit for permanent injunction is concerned, it was based on a  threat  given\r\nto the plaintiff by the defendants to dispossess her from the suit house  on\r\n2.1.2000 and 9.1.2000. This would be clear  from  reading  Para  17  of  the\r\nplaint. So far as cause of action to file suit for specific  performance  of\r\nagreement is concerned, the same was based on non performance  of  agreement\r\ndated 15.2.1989 by defendant no. 2  in  plaintiff\'s  favour  despite  giving\r\nlegal notice dated 6.3.2000 to defendant no. 2 to perform her part.\r\n30.   In our considered opinion, both the suits were, therefore, founded  on\r\ndifferent causes of action and hence could be filed  simultaneously.  Indeed\r\neven  the  ingredients  to  file  the  suit  for  permanent  injunction  are\r\ndifferent than that of the suit for specific performance of agreement\r\n31.   In case of former, plaintiff is required to make out the existence  of\r\nprima facie case, balance of convenience and irreparable loss likely  to  be\r\nsuffered by the plaintiff on facts with reference to the  suit  property  as\r\nprovided in Section 38 of the Specific  Relief  Act,  1963  (in  short     the\r\nAct   ) read with Order 39 Rule 1 &amp; 2 of CPC. Whereas, in case of  the  later,\r\nplaintiff is required to  plead  and  prove  her  continuous  readiness  and\r\nwillingness to perform her part of  agreement  and  to  further  prove  that\r\ndefendant failed to perform her  part  of  the  agreement  as  contained  in\r\nSection 16 of The Act.\r\n32.   One of the basic requirements for successfully invoking  the  plea  of\r\nOrder II Rule 2 of CPC is that the defendant of  the  second  suit  must  be\r\nable to show that the second suit was also in respect of the same  cause  of\r\naction as that on which the previous suit was based.\r\n33.   As mentioned supra, since in the case on hand, this basic  requirement\r\nin relation to cause of action is not made out, the  defendants  (appellants\r\nherein) are not entitled to raise a plea of bar contained in Order  II  Rule\r\n2 of CPC to successfully non suit the plaintiff from  prosecuting  her  suit\r\nfor specific performance of the agreement against the defendants.\r\n 34.  Indeed when the cause of action to claim the respective  reliefs  were\r\ndifferent so also the ingredients for  claiming  the  reliefs,  we  fail  to\r\nappreciate as to how a plea of Order II  Rule  2  could  be  allowed  to  be\r\nraised by the defendants and how it was sustainable on such facts.\r\n 35.  We cannot accept the submission of  learned  senior  counsel  for  the\r\nappellants when she contended that  since  both  the  suits  were  based  on\r\nidentical pleadings and when cause of action to sue for relief  of  specific\r\nperformance of agreement was available to the plaintiff prior to  filing  of\r\nthe first suit, the second suit was hit by bar contained in Order II Rule  2\r\nof CPC.\r\n36.   The submission has a fallacy for two basic reasons. Firstly,  as  held\r\nabove, cause of action in two suits being different,  a  suit  for  specific\r\nperformance could not have been instituted on the basis of cause  of  action\r\nof the first The question arises for consideration in these appeals is whether the High Court was justified in allowing the first appeals preferred by the plaintiff, resulting in decreeing the two civil suits against defendants in relation to suit house?- In order to appreciate the controversy involved in the civil suits, and now in these appeals, it was necessary to state the relevant facts- The dispute relates to a dwelling house -The suit house was purchased by defendant no. 2 from Bangalore Development Authority (in short BDA) in a scheme- Defendant no. 2 entered into an agreement with plaintiff for sale of suit house at a total consideration of Rs. 3,50,000/-- In terms of clause 2 of the agreement, the plaintiff paid a sum of Rs. 50,000/- as advance towards sale consideration-These facts are not in dispute- the plaintiff filed a civil suit being For injuction-Though this litigation was not between inter se owner and subsequent purchaser of the suit house yet in order to do substantial justice between the parties and to see the end of this long litigation and to prevent a fresh suit being instituted by defendant no.1 against defendant no.2 for refund of sale consideration which will again take years to decide and lastly when neither it involve any intricate adjudication of facts, nor it is going to cause any prejudice to the parties, we consider it just and proper to invoke our power under Article 142 of the Constitution of India in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case as narrated above and accordingly direct defendant no. 2 (owner of the suit house) to refund Rs. 4 lacs to defendant no. 1 within three months after execution of sale deed by them in favour of plaintiff pursuant to the impugned judgment/decree- failure to refund the amount within three months, would carry interest at the rate of 9% payable on the unpaid amount from the date of this order till recovery and defendant no. 1, in the event of non-payment by defendant no. 2, would be entitled to levy execution against defendant no. 2 for realization of outstanding money along with interest as awarded treating this order to be a decree in appropriate executing court in accordance with law- Held- These appeals were accordingly disposed of-  No costs. Disposed off','Ranjana Vs State Of Maharashtra &amp; Ors      This appeal arises out of the judgment and order, dated 28th\n\nNovember, 2002, in Writ Petition No. 5058 of 2002, delivered by a\n\nDivision Bench of the High Court of Judicature of Bombay at\n\nAurangabad. By the impugned order, the High Court has dismissed\n\nappellant&apos;s petition questioning the correctness of the orders passed\n\nby the Caste Scrutiny Committee, which had invalidated the claim of\n\nthe appellant as belonging to the \"Mahar\" caste, finally resulting in\n\nher disqualification as a Member of the Zilla Parishad, Aurangabad.\n\n     In order to appreciate the issue, requiring determination, a few\n\nmaterial facts may be stated:\n\n     The appellant was born on 29th May, 1976 to Namdeo Nathaiji\n\nBagul and Zalabai Bagul, a farmer \"Mahar\" family. On 22nd April,\n1996, she married Babasaheb Nana Sature, a resident of Village\n\nJategaon according to \"Boudh\" rites.\n\n     In January, 2002, elections to the Zilla Parishad, Aurangabad\n\nwere announced and in the said election, the Constituency of\n\n&apos;10-Mahalgaon Circle&apos; was reserved for a Scheduled Caste citizen.\n\nOn 31st January, 2002, the appellant approached the Sub-Divisional\n\nOfficer, Vaijapur and obtained a Caste Certificate declaring that she\n\nbelonged to \"Mahar\" caste, a listed Scheduled Caste in the\n\nConstitution (Schedule Castes) Order, 1950 for the State of\n\nMaharashtra. On the basis of her Caste Certificate, the appellant\n\nfiled the nomination form as a candidate of the Shiv Sena Party to\n\ncontest for the 10-Mahalgaon Circle Seat. On 18th February, 2002,\n\nthe appellant was declared elected.\n\n     On 5th March, 2002, a complaint was lodged before the District\n\nCollector, Aurangabad by Smt. Kavita Anna Bagul, one of the\n\ndefeated candidates, alleging that the appellant was disqualified to\n\ncontest the elections as a Scheduled Caste candidate because she\n\nwas born in a Christian family and professed Christianity. On 14th\n\nMarch, 2002, another complaint on the same lines was filed by\n\nRamesh Khandagale, General Secretary, Republican Party of India.\n\n     The Collector     referred   appellant&apos;s   caste   certificate   for\n\nvalidation to the Caste Scrutiny Committee (\"the Committee\", for\n\n\n\n \nshort), which in turn got a vigilance inquiry conducted. After the\n\nsubmission of the vigilance report, the appellant filed her defence\n\nstatement. To substantiate their respective claims before the\n\nCommittee,    the   appellant   and   the   complainants    adduced\n\ndocumentary and oral evidence. The Committee by a majority view\n\nof 2 : 1, vide its order dated 25th October, 2002/18th November, 2002\n\nreturned the finding that though the appellant was born in a \"Mahar\"\n\ncaste, but her family professed Christianity inasmuch as the\n\nappellant was baptized on 27th October, 1977, when she was one\n\nyear old; she was married in a Christian family and her contention\n\nthat she had embraced Buddhism on 23rd August, 1988 was not\n\nestablished. Thus, her claim that she belonged to \"Mahar\" caste (a\n\nScheduled Caste) was rejected.\n\n     Aggrieved by the order of the Committee, the appellant\n\npreferred a writ petition in the High Court, challenging the\n\ncorrectness of the findings of the Committee. It was pleaded on\n\nbehalf of the appellant that she was born in a \"Hindu Mahar\" family;\n\nher school record shows that she was a Hindu; later on she\n\nembraced Buddhism on 23rd August, 1988; there was no Baptism\n\nceremony on 27th October, 1977 and that her marriage as also of\n\nher brothers and sisters were solemnised as per Boudh traditions.\n\n\n\n\n \n     Tracing the origin of \"Mahars\", one of the socially backward\n\nclasses in Rural Maharashtra, the High Court noted the factum of\n\nlarge scale conversions of socially backward classes in the rural\n\nareas of Maharashtra to Christianity. The High Court also noticed\n\nthe amendment carried out in the Constitution (Scheduled Castes)\n\nOrder, 1950, by the Act No.15 of 1999, whereby and whereunder\n\nthe persons who had converted themselves to \"Buddhism\" were\n\nheld eligible for the benefit of reservation as available to the\n\nScheduled Castes from 1999 onwards. Taking into consideration the\n\nevidence on record, including the entries in the Baptism Register,\n\nthe High Court observed thus:\n\n     \"Reading the Baptism register and the entries thereof in\n     respect of the petitioner on 27.10.1977, with the\n     provisions of Canon Law as reproduced hereinabove, we\n     have no doubt in our mind that the petitioner&apos;s parents\n     professed Christianity when the petitioner was baptised at\n     the age of one year and she was born to Christian\n     parents. It is obvious that the petitioner&apos;s parents continue\n     with their caste identity namely \"Mahar caste\" but that by\n     itself would not be sufficient to hold that the petitioner did\n     not Profess Christianity and she was all along a \"Mahar\n     Hindu / Buddhist\".\n\n     In so far as the stand of the appellant that she had embraced\n\nBuddhism on her marriage is concerned, the High Court observed\n\nas under:\n\n           \"It appears that the petitioner was aware of the legal\n     position, namely: on reconversion to Buddhism or\n     Hinduism she can enter into the fold of Scheduled Castes\n     and she took the plea regarding her reconversion to\n\n \n     Buddhism. In support of this defence, she relied on the\n     certificate purportedly issued by Bhadant. This Dhamma\n     Dhiksha Certificate is purportedly dated 23.8.2002 by the\n     said Bhadant. The Committee had issued a notice calling\n     upon the said person to appear before it. In spite of receipt\n     of the notice, the said Bhadant did not appear before the\n     Committee on 30.8.2002. T  Civil  - Validity of Order - Dismissal of Appellant\'s request of scrutinizing the accuracy of the requests go by the Caste Scrutiny Committee, which had negated the claim of the Appellant as having a place with the \"Mahar\" position - Hence Appeal \r\n\r\nHeld, Finding of the Committee that the Appellant is not a Scheduled Caste, being basically a finding of actuality, it is not a fit case for exercise of ward under Article 136 of the Constitution - Though the High Court has found the section with respect to Appellant\'s Baptism to have been made in the typical course of Baptism, however the passage does not fundamentally demonstrate the way that her folks had likewise changed over to Christianity - Matter remanded [para 12, 14] ','Noor Salman Makani Vs Union Of India (Jayachandra The Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nK.  JAYACHANDRA REDDY, J.- Leave granted in SLP	 (Crl.)	 No.\n1484 of 1993.\n2.   In	 both  these  matters, Noor  Salman  Makani  who  is\ndetained  under Section 3 of the COFEPOSA Act,	1974  (&apos;Act&apos;\nfor  short) is the petitioner.	The petitioner is a  citizen\nof  India.   On	 August	 26, 1992  he  was  travelling	from\nCalcutta  to Hong Kong by Thai International Airways  Flight\nNo. TC314.  After completing the immigration formalities, he\napproached  the Customs counter for clearance.	The  Customs\nauthorities   opened  his  briefcase  and   recovered	huge\nquantities  of	foreign exchange of various  countries,	 the\nvalue of which is estimated at Rs 38,06,930.  On August	 27,\n1992  he was produced under arrest before the  CJM,  Barasat\nand his application for bail was rejected.  On September 19,\n1992 an order of detention dated September\n \n18,  1992  was	served on him in the  jail  along  with	 the\ngrounds	 of  detention.	 On October 1,	1992  a	 declaration\nunder  Section 9(1) of the Act was issued and the  same	 was\nserved	on the detenu on October 13, 1992.  On	October	 15,\n1992  the  petitioner made a representation to	the  Central\nGovernment   against  the  declaration	but  the  same	 was\nrejected.   On	December  28, 1992  the	 petitioner  made  a\nrepresentation	before the Advisory Board but that was	also\nrejected.  Thereafter he filed a writ of habeas corpus and a\nDivision  Bench	 of the Calcutta High  Court  dismissed	 the\nsame.	As against the said order the present SLP  in  which\nleave is granted, has been filed.  A separate Writ  Petition\n(Crl.)	No.  261 of 1993 questioning the  declaration  under\nSection	 9(1)  of the Act has also been filed  stating	that\ncertain	 new facts have come to light which  invalidate	 the\ndeclaration.   The  detention  order is	 questioned  on	 the\nground	 that	there	was   delay   in   considering	 the\nrepresentation	and  also on the ground that  the  detaining\nauthority has not duly considered the circumstance that	 the\ndetenu	was  already  in jail and has  simply  made  a	bald\nstatement in the grounds stating that \"there is	 possibility\nof  the	 detenu being released on bail\" and the	 same  shows\nthat there is non-application of mind.\n3.   From the records it appears that the representation  of\nthe  detenu addressed to the Joint Secretary, COFEPOSA,	 New\nDelhi was forwarded by Dum Dum Central Jail authority  under\nregistered  post on October 15, 1992 and it was received  by\nthe  Ministry&apos;s	 Office	 on  October 22,  1992	and  it	 was\nforwarded  to  the Sponsoring Unit on October 23,  1992	 who\nreceived  it on October 26, 1992.  After  offering  parawise\ncomments  the same was sent by speed post to the  Ministry&apos;s\nOffice	on  October  29,  1992 which  was  received  by	 the\nMinistry&apos;s  Office on November 2, 1992.	 The  representation\nwas  put up before the Joint Secretary on November  3,	1992\nand the same was rejected on November 4, 1992.	The  Finance\nSecretary recommended the rejection of the representation on\nNovember  5,  1992  and finally	 the  Minister	for  Finance\nrejected the same on the same day and a memo dated  November\n6,  1992 was issued to the petitioner intimating  him  about\nthe rejection.\n4.   Learned  counsel appearing for the	 petitioner  submits\nthat the delay between October 15, 1992 and November 2, 1992\nhas  not  been satisfactorily explained and hence  is  fatal\nbeing violative of Article 22(5) of the Constitution.  It is\nalso  his submission that the delay of every day has  to  be\nexplained  as held by the courts.  He relied on some of	 the\njudgments of this Court including Rama Dhondu Borade v. V.K.\nSaraf,	Commissioner of Police&apos;.  There is no doubt that  in\nmany  cases  this Court has reiterated that  the  right	 and\nobligation to make and to consider the representation at the\nearliest  opportunity is a constitutional  imperative  which\ncannot	be curtailed or abridged but in considering  whether\nthere  was  undue and unexplained delay, the facts  in	each\ncase have to be examined.  In Rama Dhondu Borade case&apos;	this\nCourt observed thus: (SCC p. 180, para 20)\n	      \"True,  there is no prescribed  period  either\n	      under  the provisions of the  Constitution  or\n	      under the concerned detention law within which\n	      the\n	      1	 (1989) 3 SCC 173: 1989 SCC (Cri)  520:	 AIR\n	      1989 SC 1861\n \n	      representation should be dealt with.  The	 use\n	      of the words &apos;as soon as may be&apos; occurring  in\n	      Article  22(5)  of the  Constitution  reflects\n	      that    the    representation    should	  be\n	      expeditiously considered and disposed of	with\n	      due promptitude and diligence and with a sense\n	      of urgency and without avoidable delay.	What\n	      is  reasonable dispatch depends on  the  facts\n	      and circumstances of each case and no hard and\n	      fast  rule  can be laid down in  that  regard.\n	      However,	in case the gap between the  receipt\n	      of the representation and its consideration by\n	      the authority is so unreasonably long and	 the\n	      explanation  offered  by the authority  is  so\n	      unsatisfactory,  such delay could vitiate	 the\n	      order of detention.\"\nIn  the above case the gap between receipt and	disposal  of\nthe representation was 28 days but up to the date of service\nof the order of rejection, the delay amounted to 32 days and\nthe court was not satisfied with the explanation offered and\nit was only after a delay of 14 days that the representation\nwas disposed of and the only explanation was that some	more\ninformation  was  called  for and that	there  were  certain\nholidays  in  between.	The Court held that  the  delay	 was\nunreasonable   and  the	 explanation   was   unsatisfactory.\nRelying	 on these observations, the learned counsel  submits\nthat in the instant case the period between October 15, 1992\nand  October  22,  1992 and between  October  23,  1992	 and\nNovember  2, 1992 amounted to undue and	 unexplained  delay.\nBut  if	 we  examine  the facts it  can	 be  seen  that	 the\nrepresentation	was forwarded by the Jail Superintendent  on\nOctober	 15,  1992 itself by registered post  but  that	 was\nreceived  on October 22, 1992 by the Ministry&apos;s	 Office	 and\nthe  entire delay was due to the delay in  postal  delivery.\nTherefore  the	same cannot be said to be  unreasonable	 and\nunexplained.   With regards the period between	October	 23,\n1992  and  November  2,	 1992  there  were  intervening	 two\nSaturdays  and	two  Sundays.  However, on  receipt  of	 the\nrepresentation on October 22, 1992 the same was forwarded on\nOctober	 23, 1992 for parawise comments.  In  this  context,\nthe High Court also has noted that to offer parawise remarks\nit  would  have taken some time because	 the  representation\ncontained   several   allegations   against   the    Customs\nauthorities and necessary information had to be gathered for\noffering  the remarks.	The Sponsoring Unit received  it  on\nOctober 26, 1992 and with the parawise remarks forwarded the\nsame by speed post to the Ministry on October 29, 1992.

He made an\n\nentry at sr. no. 30 in the station diary and at about 10.45 p.m. sent a message\n\nto the Control Room and the other police stations. An entry in this behalf\n\nwas recorded in the station diary at sr. no. 32. Sanjay Shahane (P.W. 4)\n\ncame to the police station and A.S.I. Satpute (P.W. 11) recorded the report\n\nof&apos; Sanjay (P.W. 4) at Exh. 125. An entry in this behalf was accordingly\n\nmade in the station diary at sr. no.33. Sanjay Shahane (P.W. 4) immediately\n\nleft the police station on receiving message that his uncle Jaikumar (P.W. 2)\n\n\n\n\n \nhad become unconscious. Thereafter at about 2355 hrs., original accused\n\nNo.13 Pratibha came to the police station and gave a report in respect of a\n\nnon-cognizable offence. An entry in respect thereof was made in the station\n\ndiary at sr. no. 34. Original accused No.10 Amol and juvenile offender\n\nRama were referred to the hospital as they had sustained minor injuries. The\n\nXerox copy of the entries in the station diary are Exh. 156. A.P.I. Shinde\n\n(P.W. 12) who was also attached to Police Station, Pathardi took over the\n\ninvestigation of Crime No.33 of 1998 from A.S.I. P.W. 11 Satpute as the\n\ncrime had been registered on the basis of the first information report of\n\nSanjay Shahane (P.W.4). A.P.I. Shinde (P.W. 12) received a copy of the\n\nstatement of Digambar (P.W. 1). On 8.3.1998, A.P.I. Shinde accordingly\n\nvisited the mortuary and drew the inquest panchnama of the dead bodies of\n\nDhananjay and Santosh vide inquest panchnamas at Exhs. 116 and 117 in\n\nthe presence of witnesses. Thereafter on the same day he visited the scene of\n\nthe offence at about 9.30 A.M. and drew the scene of the offence\n\npanchnama at Exh. 111 in the presence of P.W. 1 Digambar. The scene of\n\nthe offence was pointed out by P.W. 4 Sanjay Shahane and the spot is a\n\nnarrow lane to the south of the main road of Pathardi. The narrow lane\n\nwhich is the scene of the offence is known as Rangar Galli. Deceased\n\n\n\n\n \nDhananjay had been killed in front of the house of one Pandurang Kasar\n\nwhile deceased Sanjay had been killed in front of the house of one\n\nBhagirath Bajaj. The lane was of a width of about 4 ft. with stone flooring.\n\nDried bloodstains were noticed in front of the house of Bhagirath Bajaj as\n\nwell as in front of the house of Pandurang Kasar. The distance between the\n\ntwo spots where the murder of deceased Sanjay and deceased Dhananjay\n\nhad been committed is at about 10 ft. The spot panchnama further records\n\nthat at a distance of 25 ft. house of one Vilas Rodi is situated and an electric\n\nbulb is affixed on the door of his house. At a distance of 30 ft. towards the\n\nsouthern side, there is an electric pole with tube light. A Ganpati temple is\n\nat a distance of 300 ft. and adjacent to the said Ganpati temple is the house\n\nof complainant. On the same day, accused Mukund, accused Rajendra,\n\naccused Santosh, accused Satish, accused Manoj, accused Rakesh and\n\naccused Sunil came to be arrested vide arrest panchnama at Exh. 152. On\n\nthe same daly at Indian Penal Code, 1860 - Sections 302/149, 143, 144, 147, 148 and 506/149- - Double murder- - Conviction and sentence- - Whether subject to obstruction?- - Held, yes- - Presence of appealing party not set up from proof of P.Ws. 2 and 6- - Appellant took positive stand that he was absent in town at significant time- - And was at separation of 200 kms. from place of event - Both courts beneath alluded to this angle - But arrived at conclusions in light of derives - Conviction of appealing party put aside. ','Bhagwan Singh &amp; Ors Vs State Of M.P SETHI, J.\n\n	The appellants, alongwith two others, were charged under Sections 148, 302, 336, 337, 427 read\nwith Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code by the Court of Additional Sessions Judge, Burhanpur and after\ntrial acquitted by the trial court vide its judgment dated 24th June, 1987.  The appeal filed by the State\nagainst the order of acquittal was allowed by the High Court vide the judgment impugned convicting the\nappellants for offences under Section 302/149 and sentencing them to life imprisonment besides paying a\nfine of Rs.5,000/- each in default of which they have been directed to suffer further rigorous imprisonment\nfor one year each.  They were also convicted for the commission of offence under Section 148 IPC and\nsentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year each.\n\n	Not satisfied with the judgment of the High Court, the appellants have preferred this appeal under\nSection 379 of the Code of Criminal Procedure read with Order XXI Rules 12 to 29 of the Supreme Court\nRules, 1966.\n\n	According to the prosecution there was a dispute between Amarnath (deceased) and Ram Singh,\nappellant with respect to four mango trees grown on Khasra No.212 situated at Village Sarai.  Litigation\nwas pending between both the parties and police had registered several cases under Sections 147 and 145 of\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure.	 According to the FIR recorded on the statement of PW22 Jagdish that he\nalong with his family members was watching TV at his house.  Amarnath and Hari Ram were also there.\nWhen he was about to start his meals, they heard the cries of \"Bachao-Bachao\" (save-save) raised by\nSurender.  They saw all the 16 accused persons assaulting Surender with lathis, Dhariya, Khartaliya and\nPata.  When Hari Ram went to intervene, the accused attacked him.  Similarly when Amarnath went\nforward he was also assaulted.	Ram Singh instigated other accused persons to finish Amarnath saying that\nas he was responsible for everything, he should be finished today.  Thereafter Ram Singh, Bhagwan Singh,\nSardar Singh, Roop Singh and Dhyansingh attacked Amarnath with lethal weapons in their possession.\nWitness rushed forward to save his father and was also attacked by the aforesaid accused persons.  He ran\naway to the house to save himself.  The accused then threw stones on the house which broke roof tiles,\ndoors and also damaged the walls.  After registration of the FIR, the investigating officers sent the injured,\nnamely, Surender and Hari Ram to the District Hospital, Khandwa where they died the same night, the\ninformation of which was sent to the police by Hospital Authorities.  Mukesh was also found injured and\nsent for treatment to the hospital.  In the occurrence three persons, namely, Surender, Hari Ram and\nAmarnath were murdered and some of the witnesses injured.\n\n	The trial court acquitted the accused persons on finding that appellants Bhagwan Singh, Ram\nSingh, Roop Singh had received injuries and \"seeing danger of life and other accused utilised right of\nprivate defence and there aggressors died and rest aggressors fled away.  Hence the act of the accused fall\nwithin the definition of right of private defence u/s 100 IPC and their act is not punishable according to\nprovisions of section 96 IPC\".	The trial court further held, \"I find that prosecution failed to prove case\nbeyond reasonable doubts and accused committed murder of deceased Amarnath, Surender and Hariram\nand caused injuries to Mukesh witness and damaged house of Jagdish after throwing stones\". Holding that\nthe prosecution had failed to prove the offence against accused beyond all reasonable doubts and giving\nthem the benefit of right of self-defence, as contemplated under Section 100 IPC, he acquitted the accused\npersons.\n\n	The High Court rightly found that the trial court had been led astray by the simple fact that the\ninjuries on the person of the accused had not been explained by the prosecution witnesses.  After referring\nto number of judgments of this Court, the High Court concluded:\n\n\"In view of what we have discussed about the circumstances\nof the case, the injuries on the persons of the three\ndeceased, the sequence in which the witnesses reached the\nspot of crime, minor nature of the injuries on the persons\nof the accused except one injury on the head of Bhagwan\nSingh and the background and also the sequence in which the\ndeceased were attacked, rules out any possibility of the\naccused having attacked the three deceased in exercise of\nself-defence of any of them.  It is clear that the accused\npersons were the aggressors.\"\n\n\n	After critically and minutely examining the evidence on record,\nthe High Court found that the presence of eye-witnesses, namely, Kiran\n(PW7), Mukesh (PW12) and Jagdish (PW22) cannot be doubted.  In this\nregard the court held:\n\n\"A striking feature of this case is that one of the accused\nSardarsingh lodged a report Ex.D-5 at 11.30 p.m. that 4\npersons i.e. Amarnath, Jagdish, Surendra and Hariram were\nassaulting Bhagwansingh and Roopsingh.	Even here Jagdish\nwitness was shown present and there was no mention of\nRamsingh accused.  Then in cross examination to these three\neye-witnesses the suggestions have been that the deceased\nand the witnesses along with others assaulted the accused at\nthe house of Ramsingh.	The trial court has ignored this\ntrend of cross examination on behalf of the accused in\nappreciating whether the witnesses were present at the scene\nof violence.  In the facts and circumstances of a given\ncase, the trend of cross-examination by defence or\nprosecution witness can provide support to the inference if\nsome accused and witnesses were present at the scene of\ncrime.	The most striking feature is the fact that such a\nreport was recorded by the police and they at one proceeded\nto the scene of crime.	There is no mention in Ex.D-5 if any\nserious injury was given to Sardarsingh or Roopsing and\nwhether any weapon has been used or only fists blows were\nbeing exchanged.  Still the police rushed to the scene of\ncrime at the night.  This is rare.  This indicates that\nthere was some under current working between the police and\nthe accused persons.  The police could not but have recorded\nthe Dehati Nalishi on finding one person died and 2 in the\nprocess of dying with fatal injuries.  This is followed by\nlapse of the investigating officer in recorded statement of\nMukesh and Kiran after 7 days if Kiran had not witnesses the\noccurrence there was no need to introduce her as a witness\nwhen there were witnesses such as Jagdish and Mukesh whose\npresence at that spot could hardly be challenged.  So, if\nanything, investigation was unfair towards the complainant\nparty and not against the accused persons.\"\n\nand concluded:\n\n\"So we find the testimony of these witnesses, trustworthy\nand also confirmatory to each other.  Their presence is\nestablished at the scene of crime.  Their testimony is\ncorroborated by FIR and by medical evidence.\"\n\n	We do not agree with the submissions of the learned counsel for\nthe appellants that under Section 378 of the Code of Criminal Procedure\nthe High Court could not disturb the finding of facts of the trial court\neven if it found that the view taken by the trial court was not proper.\nOn the basis of the pronouncements of this Court, the settled position\nof law regarding the powers of the High Court in an appeal against an\norder of acquittal is that the Court has full powers to review the\nevidence upon which an order of acquittal is based and generally it will\nnot interfere with the order of acquittal because by passing an order of\nacquittal the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused is\nreinforced.  The golden thread which runs through the web of\nadministration of justice in criminal case is that if two views are\npossible on the evidence adduced in the case, one pointing to the guilt\nof the accused and the other to his innocence, the view which is\nfavourable to the accused should be adopted.  Such is not a jurisdiction\nlimitation on the appellate court but a Judge made guidelines for\ncircumspection.	 The paramount consideration of the court is to ensure\nthat miscarriage of justice is avoided.	 A miscarriage of justice which\nmay arise from the acquittal of guilty is no less than from the\nconviction of an innocent.  In a case where the trial court has taken a\nview ignoring the admissible evidence, a duty is cast upon the High\nCourt to reappreciate the evidence in acquittal appeal for the purposes\nof ascertaining as to whether all or any of the accused has committed\nany offence or not.  Probable view taken by the trial court which may\nnot be disturbed in the appeal is such a view which is based upon legal\nand admissible evidence.  In the instant case the trial court acquitted\nthe respondents by not re Code of Criminal Procedure - area 379 - Supreme Court Rules - Order XXI Rules 12 to 29 - advance under - Indian Penal Code - Sections 148, 302, 336, 337, 427 read with Section 149 - offenses under - conviction and sentence under the settled position of law in regards to the forces of the High Court in an interest against a request of quittance is that the court has full powers to survey the proof whereupon a request or vindication is based and for the most part it won\'t meddle with the request of absolution in light of the fact that by passing a request of exoneration the assumption guiltlessness for the denounced is strengthened - for a situation where the trial court has taken a view overlooking the allowable confirmation, an obligation is provided reason to feel ambiguous about the High Court to reappreciate the proof in quittance advance for the motivations behind learning concerning whether all or any of the charged has perpetrated any offense or not - the trial court wrongly held that the respondents were supported in bringing on the demise of three people in practice of their privilege of self-preservation - no legitimacy in offer - rejected. ','Sumatidevi M. Dhanwatay Vs Union Of India And Ors JUDGMENT\n\n2004(3) SCR 928\n\nThe following Judgment of the Court was delivered\n\nThe appellant travelled by 1st Class Air conditioned berth from Nagpur to\nBombay by Howrah-Bombay Mail. She was carrying her luggage which included\ngold, pearl, silver and diamond jewellery and other valuables valued at Rs.\n1,11,756. While she was travelling, she was assaulted by some unauthorised\npassengers and her gold, silver, pearl, diamond and other valuables were\ntaken away forcibly. This incident occurred on 4.12.1991. Thousands of\npersons entered into the compartment and assaulted the passengers,\nincluding the appellant. The said crowd was so violent that they broke the\ndoors, window bars, glass panels, seating berths and toilets etc. This\napart, the crowd committed so many other illegal acts of assaulting the\nbonafide passengers. They molested the women and even raped the young girl\npassengers. The appellant pulled the alarm chain three times, as a result\nof which, the train stopped at Igatpuri Station. She, alongwith other\nbonafide passengers got down at that station. She approached the Railway\nAuthorities for protection, but, without any assistance. On reaching\nBombay, she lodged a complaint with the police about the incident. The\nappellant approached the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission,\nMaharashtra State (hereinafter referred to as &apos;the State Commission&apos;, for\nshort) by filing a complaint claiming compensation of Rs. 9,32,256. The\nState Commission, after considering the material that was placed before it\nand on considering the rival contentions, allowed the claim of the\nappellant partly awarding total compensation of Rs. 1,41,756. The Railway\nadministration, aggrieved by and not satisfied with the said order, filed\nan appeal before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission\n(hereinafter referred to as &apos;the National Commission&apos;, for short). The\nNational Commission, by the order under challenge in this appeal, set aside\nthe order made by the State Commission. Hence this appeal.\n\nThe learned counsel for the appellant strongly contended that the National\nCommission was not right and justified on facts as well as in law in\nupsetting the order passed by the State Commission; the National Commission\nhas set aside the order made by the State Commission without dislodging the\nreasons given by the State Commission in allowing the claim made by the\nappellant; the National Commission has set aside the order of the State\nCommission simply stating that the State Commission was not right in\nupholding that there has been a deficiency in service on the part of the\nRailway administration. The learned counsel added that having regard to the\nfacts found, the State Commission was fully justified in ordering the\ncompensation.\n\nIn opposition, the learned counsel for the respondent Nos. 1 to 4 submitted\nthat the order impugned in this appeal is just and supportable order.\nAccording to her, the State Commission had no jurisdiction to entertain the\ncomplaint made by the appellant; there was no deficiency in service on the\npart of the Railway administration; when an unruly mob entered into the\nrailway compartment and caused damage on the person and property of the\npassengers, the Railway administration was helpless. In such a situation,\nno complaint could be entertained by the State Commission under the\nConsumer Protection Act, 1986.\n\nWe have considered the respective submissions made on behalf of the\nparties. As is evident from the order of the State Commission that opposite\nparties Nos 1, 3, 5 &amp; 6, i.e., Union of India, Chief Security\nCommissioner, Secretary, Home Department and Inspector General of Police,\nremained absent. No written version was filed by any of the parties on the\ndate given. The complaint was posted for final hearing on 14.9.1993, on\nwhich date the Union of India and the General Manager, Central Railway\nfiled written version jointly. The averment made in the complaint that the\nappellant travelled by train on that day when the incident happened, is\nadmitted. However, the Railway administration denied its responsibility as\nto the theft of luggage of the appellant and the injuries suffered by her.\nThe only contention of the Railway administration was that it was not\nresponsible for the toss of luggage and injuries caused to the appellant.\nThe State Commission, on consideration of the facts and circumstances, has\nrecorded that having regard to the past experience, the Railway\nadministration did not take reasonable steps to avoid such incident. It is\nalso recorded in the order of the State Commission that the allegations of\ninjuries suffered by the appellant and the loss caused to her luggage, the\nRailway administration had not been able to controvert effectively. It was\nsubmitted on behalf of the Railway administration before the State\nCommission that the claim as to the loss of ornaments urged by the\nappellant, was exaggerated. As&apos; regards loss of the Bank Draft, it was\ncontended that intimation could be given to the concerned Bank. An argument\nwas also advanced that the complaint was not maintainable under the\nprovisions of  Consumer Act- safety- Compansation- The appellant travelled by 1st Class Air conditioned berth from Nagpur to Bombay by Howrah-Bombay Mail- she was assaulted by some unauthorised passengers and her gold, silver, pearl, diamond and other valuables were taken away forcibly- They molested the women and even raped the young girl passengers. The appellant pulled the alarm chain three times, as a result of which, the train stopped at Igatpuri Station-She, alongwith other bonafide passengers got down at that station. She approached the Railway Authorities for protection, but, without any assistance- she lodged a complaint with the police about the incident. The appellant approached the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Maharashtra State by filing a complaint claiming compensation of Rs. 9,32,256- The State Commission, after considering the material that was placed before it and on considering the rival contentions, allowed the claim of the appellant partly awarding total compensation of Rs. 1,41,756- The Railway administration, aggrieved by and not satisfied with the said order, filed an appeal before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (hereinafter referred to as \'the National Commission\', for short). The National Commission, by the order under challenge in this appeal, set aside the order made by the State Commission. Hence this appeal-under Section 124A of the Railways Act, 1989, the Railway administration cannot escape the liability having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case and in the light of the incident that had taken place. As to the deficiency of service on the part of the Railway administration, no such plea was raised before the State Commission. The Railway administration also did not raise any issue as to the maintainability of the complaint or jurisdiction of the State Commission to deal with the complaint. Even otherwise, under Section 3 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, the complaint could be entertained by the State Commission in the absence of any such plea taken by the Railway administration as to the jurisdiction to entertain the complaint. This being the position, in our view, the impugned order passed by the National Commission cannot be sustained. No good reason was given by the National Commission to upset the order passed by the State Commission, as already observed. Under the circumstances, the appeal is entitled to succeed. Accordingly, it is allowed and the impugned order is set aside. The respondent-Railways shall pay Rs. 5000 to the appellant towards cost.

MOHAPATRA,J This appeal, filed by accused no.1 Babu Kuttan Ramkrishna Pillai and accused no.2 Umesh @ Babu Purshottam Bhatt of TADA ACT Spl.Case No.33 of 1994, is directed against the judgment and order dated 21.8.1998 of the Designated Court at Brihan `Mumbai under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 (for short TADA Act). In the said case seven accused persons faced trial under Section 120-B read with 307 r/w 34, 307 r/w 114, 307 r/w 149, 387 r/w 34, 143, 144, 147, 148 and 506 (ii), 353 r/w 114 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 3(2)(ii), 3(3), 3(5), 5 and 6 of the TADA Act and section r/w 25(IB)\r\n\r\n(a), Section 5 r/w 27 of the Arms Act. The gist of the prosecution case relevant for the purpose of this proceeding may be stated thus: With the growth of industry, commerce and trade in and around the city of Mumbai which generates substantial quantity of wealth, there has been increase of organised activities by gangs of anti-socials to extract money from affluent sections of society like developers, hoteliers and other businessmen by putting them in fear of death and then to demand substantial sums of money commonly known as &quot;Khadani&quot; i.e. protection money. One such gang was operating in the city under Amar Naik @ Bhai, who died a couple of years before the decision in the case at an encounter with the police. The prosecution alleged that in pursuance of a criminal conspiracy between 15.1.1994 to 16.5.1994 the accused persons and others of the gang embarked upon preparatory acts like procuring the information about the names of the builders of M/s Kalpataru Construction Company which was engaged in developing a property at Pali Hill, named Nakshatra Building. PW-7 Sudhir Tambe was the Senior Vice-President of the company with its head office at Nariman Point. He used to sit in the head- office. PW 6 Pachapur, Civil Engineer, was an employee of the company who used to remain at the site to supervise the construction. As the prosecution story runs, on 15.4.1994 between 11.30 a.m. and 12.00 noon while PW 6 was on duty at the construction site, accused no.3, Nitin Vasant Venugurlekar armed with revolver and accused No.4 Rajindera @ Rajan Mahadeo Margaj armed with a chopper and accused no.5 Jayendra @ Jai Anandrao Jadhav also armed with a chopper visited the site of Nakshatra Building; they threatened the workers at the site, forcibly brought PW 6 Pachapur in a room on the ground floor and man-handled him. Accused no.3, pointing a revolver at him demanded the name, address and telephone number of the builders. PW 6 disclosed the name of PW 7 Tambe and gave his telephone number to them. The accused then asked him to go to the office of the builders at Nariman Point and make the arrangement for a telephonic talk with Tambe. PW 6 rushed to the office and told Tambe of what had happened at the construction site. This was followed by telephonic calls from the accused who wanted to speak to Tambe. Attempts were made by PW 6 and PW 7 to avoid any discussion with the gangsters. Two or three days thereafter when the accused got Tambe on the telephone he (Tambe) gave them some other telephone numbers and asked them to contact those persons including one D.N.Ghosh, the Security Contractor. Eight/ten days thereafter again a telephone call was made to the office of Tambe which was received by PW 6 who was informed by the person making the call that they could not get D. N. Ghosh on the telephone numbers furnished by Tambe. Thereafter PW 6 handed over the receiver to Tambe. This incident was followed by several threats given by the gangsters to workers and also repeated telephone calls made to the Head Office of the company to contact Tambe. The staff of the site office absented from work resulting in virtual closure of construction activity. On 11.5.1994 the deceased Sanjay Patil telephoned to Tambe and warned him that he is wasting time and should meet him without further delay. After some days there was one more similar call from Sanjay Patil and he asked Tambe that he should talk to Bhai and saying so he handed over the receiver to another person who gave his identity as Amar Naik (since deceased), who told Tambe that he should pay Rs.10 lacs. The later pleaded his inability to pay such a heavy sum and after some discussion agreed to pay Rs.5 lacs. He was asked to come to Nakshatra Building site on 16.5.1994 along with money. In the meantime Tambe informed all the happenings to the Addl. Commissioner of Police Mr.Sanjeev Dayal and the then Dy. Commissioner of Police of Zone VII Mr. Rajanish Sheth within whose jurisdiction Khar Police Station fell.\r\n\r\nOn 16.5.1994 at about 12.00 noon the deceased Sanjay Patil telephoned Tambe and inquired from him as to what he was going to do about the payment and then Tambe replied that he will be leaving office at about 2.00 p.m. for Pali Hill. Sanjay Patil cautioned him that he should not make any haste and he should wait for his call so that he will take necessary instructions from his boss i.e. Amar Naik. At about 2.00 p.m. on that day there was a telephone call from Sanjay Patil telling that Tambe should not meet him at the Nakshatra Building site but instead he should meet him near the Ceaser Palace Hotel. This telephonic conversation was tape-recorded. Tambe was instructed on telephone that his man shall carry a white plastic bag containing the amount of Rs.5 lacs and shall wait near the entrance gate of Ceaser\r\n Indian Penal Code Section 120-B r/w 307, 34 likewise 307, r/w 114, 149 and 387 r/w 34, 143, 144, 147, 148 and 506(ii), 353 r/w 114 - Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 `TADA Act&#39; 25(IB)(a) - the Arms Act Section 5, 27 - Indian Penal Code, Section 120-B and 395 considered as saw - charged sentenced detainment for a long time - We do not find that the appreciation of evidence made by the learned trial Judge suffers from any illegality nor can findings recorded by him be said to be perverse- Appeal rejected.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n Appeal Dismissed','Shamkant Narayan Despande Vs Maharashtra Industrial CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Special Leave petition (c) No.\n4748 of 1991.\nFrom the Judgment and Order dated 21.1.91 of the Bombay High\nCourt in W.P. No. 3481 of 1990.\nN.B. Shetye,  P.M.  Pradhan  and  A.M.	khanwilkar  for	 the\npetitioner.\nDushyant Dave, Beliram Vakil, Abrar Ali, Ajit Yogi, Gajender\nLal, Mukul Gupta and Ms. Sonia Khan for the Respondents.\nThe Judgment of the court was delivered by\n     SAWANT,  J.   The	petitioner  is	diploma-  holder  in\nEngineering  and holds the post of Executive Engineer in the\nrespondent-Corporation. Till 1974, the promotion post of the\nsuperintending Engineer	 was  available	 both  for  diploma-\nholders and degree-holders according to merit-cum-seniority.\nThis was  so according	to  the	 practice  followed  by	 the\nCorporation without  making any	 rules or regulation in that\nbehalf. In  1974, the corporation made regulation by passing\na resolution  by passing a resolution and continued the same\npractice. Admittedly,  the regulation  were not	 made  under\nsection 64  of the  Maharashtra Industrial  Development Act,\n1961 [hereinafter  referred to as the &apos;Act&apos;] under which the\nrespondent-corporation was  created. Thereafter in 1988, the\ncorporation passed a resolution, for the first time,. making\n75 per	cent of	   the	posts  of  superintending  engineers\navailable to  the executive Engineers holding degrees and 25\nper cent  to  the  Executive  Engineers	 who  were  diploma-\nholders.  This	 resolution  was   also	 admittedly   not  a\nregulation made	 under the   said  section 64.	But for this\nresolution, the	 petitioner who was senior to respondent NO.\n2 would	 have been  promoted to	 the post  of Superintending\nEngineer on  31st October,  1990. However,  since respondent\nNo.2 was a degree holder, he got the said resolution and was\npromoted to the said post on that date. It is this promotion\nwhich was challenged by the petitioner by a writ petition in\nthe High  Court. The  High Court  by the  impugned  judgment\ndismissed the said petition.\n     2.	 Two   contentions  were  raised\n     before us.\n     (i) that no classification could be\n     made among	 the Executive Engineers\n     on the  basis of  their educational\n     qualification for	the  purpose  of\n     promotion	 to    the    post    of\n     superintending Engineer, since they\n     belong  to	  the  same   cadre   of\n     Executive Engineers and do the same\n     work.  There   was	 also  a  common\n     seniority	  of	the    Executive\n     Engineers	maintained.   hence  the\n     classification  was  discriminatory\n     in nature and violative of Articles\n     14 and 16 of the Constitution .\n     (ii)  that	  if  at   all	such   a\n     discrimination was	 permissible, it\n     could be  made only  be a statutory\n     rule  or  regulation  framed  under\n     Section 64	 of the said Act. A mere\n     resolution	   or	 an    executive\n     instruction could	not effect  such\n     discrimination.\n3.   We find  not merit in either of the two contentions. It\nis now	well settled  that for	the purpose  of promotion, a\nvalid classification  can made among the members holding the\nsame post  on the  basis of their qualification. In state of\nJummu &amp;	 Kashmir v.  Triloki Nath Khosa &amp; Ors., [1974] 1 SCR\n771, a Constitution Bench of his court has clearly held that\nsuch a	classification is  permissible and  does not violate\nArticles 14  and  16  of  the  Constitution  the  Court	 has\nobserved there that in state of Mysore &amp; Anr. v. P. Narasing\nRao, [1968]  1 SCR  407 and The Union of India and others v.\nDr.(Mrs.) S.B.	Kholi, AIR  1973 SC 811, it was already held\nthat   classification	 on   the   basis   of	 educational\nqualification was  permissible. The  Court then	 referred to\nRoshan Lal  Tandon v.  Union of India, [1968] 1 SCR  185 and\ndistinguished it  on the facts by pointing out that it was a\ncase of	 the direct  recruits and  promotees integrated into\none cadre.  Once they  were integrated they lost their birth\nbirth-marks, viz.  the different   sources  from which	they\nwere recruited.	 [Emphasis supplied].  The court pointed out\nthat Roshan Lal&apos;s case [supra] was thus no authority for the\nproposition that  if direct  recruits  and    promotees	 are\nintegrated into	 one class  they cannot	 be  classified	 for\npurposed of promotion on a basis other than that in the case\nbefore the them the classified for purpose of promotion on a\nbasis  other  than  that  they	were  drawn  from  different\nsources. The  court also  pointed out  that the	 very  Bench\nwhich decided  Roshan Lal&apos;s    case  [supra]  he Constitution of India, Art.14, Art.16 - Promotion to post of Superintending Engineer - Classification of degree-holder and confirmation holder Executive Engineers - Not violative Arts. 14 and 16. \r\n\r\nMaharashtra Industrial Development Act (3 of 1962), S.64. \r\n\r\nAIR 1983 SC 881, Held per incuriam. \r\n\r\nAIR 1974 SC 1, Foll. \r\n\r\nAdvancement - Classification among same class on premise of capabilities - Permissible. \r\n\r\nMaharashtra Industrial Development Act (3 of 1962), S.63 - Promotion to post of Superintending Engineer - Classification of degree holder and confirmation holder Executive Engineers - Made by Corporation by passing simple determination - Not illicit. \r\n\r\nAuthoritative law - Change in administration condition by passing simple determination - allowable. \r\n\r\nStates of Service - Can be changed by official guidelines.\r\n\r\nheld: The proposition that in the absence of the rules and regulations, the authority can act by executive instruction finds direct support in Mysore state Road Transport Corporation v.

In\nregard to  the first  ground, the trial Court found that the\ntenant was\n \nin arrears  of payment	of rent	 but  that  the	 tenant	 was\nentitled to the Protection of s. 12(3) of the Madhya Pradesh\nAccommodation Control Act, 1961, as the tenant had deposited\nthe arrears  of rent within the time allowed by the Court on\nhis application.  When the  appeal preferred by the landlord\nwas pending before the Additional District Judge, Satna, the\ntenant filed  an application  for condonation  of delay R in\ndepositing the	rent,  month  by  month,  which	 had  become\npayable after  the filing  of the  suit, as stipulated by s.\n13(1) of  the Act.  It appears	that, on  several occasions,\nwhen the  suit and  the appeal were pending before the trial\ncourt and  the appellate  court respectively, the tenant had\ndeposited the monthly rent a day or two or three, beyond the\nprescribed date.  The amount  had been received by the court\nand drawn  out	by  the	 landlord,  apparently	without	 any\nprotest. Taking	 advantage of  the filing  of  the  tenant&apos;s\napplication for condonation of delay, the landlord contended\nthat the  court had  no power to extend the time for deposit\nof the monthly rent and that he was entitled to a decree for\neviction  consequent   on  the	 non-compliance	  with	 the\nprovisions  of	 s.  13	  (  1	 )  of	the  Madhya  Pradesh\nAccommodation Control Act. The appellate court negatived the\nlandlord&apos;s contention and dismissed the appeal. The landlord\npreferred a  Second Appeal  to	the  High  Court  of  Madhya\nPradesh. The High Court, holding that the court had no power\nto extend  time, decreed  the suit for eviction. The tenant,\nhaving obtained special leave, has appealed to this Court.\n     Shri  Khanduja,  learned  counsel	for  the  appellant,\nraised two  contentions before	us. The first contention was\nthat the  High Court was wrong in holding that the Court had\nno power to condone the delay in depositing the monthly rent\nfalling due  after the	filing of the suit for eviction. The\nsecond contention  was that,  in the  circumstances  of	 the\ncase. the  respondent must  be considered  to have waived or\nabandoned the right to insist on dis-entitling the tenant of\nthe protection	to which  he was  otherwise  entitled.	Shri\nNaik, learned  counsel for  the respondent, contended to the\ncontrary on both the questions.\n     The Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Control Act, 1961, was\nenacted, as recited in the statement of objects and reasons,\n\"for the  purpose of  controlling, letting  of and  rents of\nresidential  and  nonresidential  accommodation	 and  giving\nadequate protection  to tenants	 of  such  accommodation  in\nareas where there is dearth of accommodation\". Section 12(1)\nof the	Act provides  that no  suit shall  be-filed ill	 any\ncivil court  against a	tenant for  his	 eviction  from	 any\naccommodation except on one or more of the grounds specified\ntherein. Several  grounds are specified, such as, failure to\npay the	 arrears of  rent after	 the service  of  notice  of\ndemand, unlawful sub-letting of the whole or\n \npart of	 the accommodation, creation of a nuisance, bonafide\nrequirement of the accommodation by the landlord for his own\noccupation,   causing	of   substantial   damage   to	 the\naccommodation  etc.  etc.  The	ground	with  which  we	 are\nconcerned is that mentioned in s. 12(1) (a) and-it is: \"that\nthe tenant  has neither	 paid nor  tendered the whole of the\narrears of  rent legally  recoverable from  him	 within	 two\nmonths of  the date  on which  a notice	 of demand  for	 the\narrears of  rent has  been served  on him by the landlord in\nthe prescribed	manner\". Thus,	where a tenant is in arrears\nof rent,  a landlord  is obliged,  before instituting a suit\nfor eviction  on that  ground, to  serve a  notice of demand\ncalling upon  the tenant  to pay  or tender the whole of the\narrears of  rent within two months of the date of service of\nthe notice. S. 12(3) provides that an order for the eviction\nof a  tenant shall not be made on the ground specified in s.\n12(1) (a),  if	the  tenant  makes  payment  or	 deposit  as\nrequired by  s. 13. S. 13,sub-ss. (1), (5) and (6) which are\nrelevant for the present purpose are as follows:\n	  \"13. (1)  on a suit or proceeding being instituted\n     by the landlord on any of the grounds referred to in s.\n     12, the  tenant shall,  within one month of the service\n     of the  writ of  summons on  him or within such further\n     time as  the Court	 may, on  an application made to it,\n     allow in  this behalf,  deposit in	 the Court or pay to\n     the landlord  an amount  calculated at the rate of rent\n     at which  it was  paid, for  the period  for which	 the\n     tenant may	 have  made  default  including	 the  period\n     subsequent thereto	 up to the end of the month previous\n     to that  in which	the deposit  or payment	 is made and\n     shall thereafter  continue to  deposit or pay, month by\n     month, by	the 15th  of each  succeeding  month  a	 sum\n     equivalent to the rent at that rate.\n     xx		xx	  xx	    xx	     xx\n	  (5) If  a  tenant  makes  deposit  or	 payment  as\n     required by  sub-section (1)  or  sub-section  (2),  no\n     decree or	order shall  be made  by the  Court for	 the\n     recovery of  possession of	 the  accommodation  on	 the\n     ground of default in the payment of rent by the tenant,\n     but the Court may allow such cost as it may deem fit to\n     the  The respondent-landlord	sought	 expulsion of	 the \r\n\r\nappealing party occupant from the suit	 premises for inability to pay \r\n\r\nunpaid debts of lease, regardless of administration of notice of interest. The \r\n\r\ntrial court found that the occupant was falling behind financially o. installment \r\n\r\nof lease, however the inhabitant having stored the back payments of lease \r\n\r\ninside the time permitted by the court on his application the \r\n\r\noccupant was qualified for benefit the security of segment 12(3) \r\n\r\nof the	Madhya Pradesh	Accommodation Control Act. 1961. furthermore, \r\n\r\nexpelled the suit for expulsion. \r\n\r\nThe proprietor favored an interest keeping in mind the same was \r\n\r\npending? the occupant recorded an application under area 13(1) \r\n\r\nof the	Act for	 approbation of	 delay in depositing,,	 the \r\n\r\nlease, month by month.	which had turned out to be payable after the \r\n\r\ndocumenting of the suit. On a few events, when the suit and \r\n\r\nthe interest were pending under the watchful eye of the trial court and	 the \r\n\r\ninvestigative court	 separately, the inhabitant had saved the \r\n\r\nmonth to month lease a day or a few past the endorsed \r\n\r\ndate, and the same had been gotten by the court and drawn \r\n\r\nout by	the landowner, with no dissent. The landowner, \r\n\r\nexploiting the documenting of the occupant s application \r\n\r\nfor condonation	 of postponement, fought that the court had no \r\n\r\nenergy to amplify the ideal opportunity for store of the month to month lease and \r\n\r\nthat he	 was qualified for an announcement for expulsion resulting on \r\n\r\nthe resistance with the arrangements of area 13(1) of \r\n\r\nthe Act. The redrafting court negatived this dispute and \r\n\r\nrejected the interest. In the second interest favored by the \r\n\r\nproprietor, the High Court held that the Court had no energy to \r\n\r\nbroaden time and declared the Suit for ousting. \r\n\r\nIn the occupant\'s interest to this Court on the question \r\n\r\nwhether the Court ha(l. the ability to overlook the deferral in \r\n\r\nsaving the month to month lease falling due after the filling of \r\n\r\nthe suit for ousting. \r\n\r\n^ \r\n\r\nHELD :1. The court had the purview to augment time \r\n\r\nfor store or installment of month to month lease falling due after the \r\n\r\nrecording of the suit. [338 G] \r\n\r\n2. Keeping in mind the end goal to qualifies an inhabitant for claim the insurance \r\n\r\nof area 12(3). the inhabitant needed to make installment or store \r\n\r\nas required by section	 13. The unfulfilled obligations of lease ought to be \r\n\r\npaid or	 stored inside one month of the administration of the \r\n\r\nwrit of summons on the inhabitant or inside such further time as \r\n\r\nmay he	allowed by the court, and ought to further store or \r\n\r\npay each month by the fifteenth. a whole identical to the lease. \r\n\r\n[338 A-B]. \r\n\r\n335 \r\n\r\n3. Failure	 to pay	 or store a whole identical to the \r\n\r\nlease by	 the fifteenth of consistently, ensuing to the recording \r\n\r\nof the	suit for removal will	 not entitle the proprietor, \r\n\r\nstraightaway, to a declaration for removal. The results of \r\n\r\nthe store or payment	 and non-installment or non-store are \r\n\r\nrecommended by subsection and (6) of segment 13. [338 B] \r\n\r\n4. A circumspection is vested in the court under segment \r\n\r\n13(6) to arrange the striking out of the, protection against \r\n\r\nexpulsion. [338 D] \r\n\r\n5. In the event that the court has the	discretion not to strike out \r\n\r\nthe protection or an inhabitant submitting default in installment or \r\n\r\nstore of lease as required by segment 13(1), the court \r\n\r\nmost likely has the further tact to approve the default and \r\n\r\namplify the ideal opportunity for installment or store. Such a tact is \r\n\r\na fundamental ramifications of the tact not to strike out \r\n\r\nthe defence.	Any other development may	lead, to a \r\n\r\ncorruption of the question of the Act. to be specific, \'the satisfactory \r\n\r\nsecurity of the occupant.\' [338 F-G] \r\n\r\n6. Section	 12(3) qualifies an inhabitant for claim insurance \r\n\r\nagainst removal on the ground indicated in area 12(1)(a) \r\n\r\nin the event that he makes installment or store as required by area 13. As \r\n\r\nthe court has under area 13, the ability to degree: the \r\n\r\ntime for installment or store, installment or store, inside the \r\n\r\naugmented time	 will entitle	 the inhabitant to claim	 the \r\n\r\ninsurance of segment 12(3). [338 H] 1 \r\n\r\n7. Express	 arrangement for augmentation of time for store \r\n\r\non the other hand installment or lease falling due after the documenting of the suit \r\n\r\nwas not	 made in area 13(1!	 as the	 result of non- \r\n\r\ninstallment was managed with	 by a different sub-area, segment \r\n\r\n13(6). The watchfulness given to the court under segment 13(6) \r\n\r\nmust suggest a caution to excuse the postponement and broaden the \r\n\r\ntime in	 making deposit	 or installment under area 13(1). \r\n\r\n[339A, E] \r\n\r\nJagdish Kapoor v.

In this case the appellant (hereinafter called\nthe  assessee) was assessed for the assessment year  1956-57\non  a  total income of Rs. 8,400.  The	Income	Tax  Officer\nlater  on came to know that the assessee&apos;s income  from	 the\nsale  of  estates had escaped assessment.  The	Income	Tax\nOfficer	 took action under section 34(1) (a) of	 the  Income\nTax   Act,  1922  (hereinafter	called	the  Act)  for	 the\nassessment year 1956-57 on 13th August, 1959.\nUnder  an  agreement dated 18th May, 1955 a  company  called\nMundakayam  Valley  Rubber Co. Ltd. sold  and  delivered  an\nestate called Kuttikal Estate to one Mr. A. V. George.	 The\narea  of the estate was 477 acres and 71 cents.	 Mr.  A.  V.\nGeorge had entered into the agreement in his own name and on\nbehalf of another company called the Kailas Rubber Co.	Ltd.\nIt  was agreed that the vendor would execute  the  necessary\nconveyance  in favour of Mr. A. V. George or  his  nominees.\nOn 15th August. 1955. the assessee entered into an agreement\nwith  Mr.  A.  V.  George whereby  the	assessee  agreed  to\npurchase  477.71 acres forming part of Kuttikal	 Estate	 for\nRs.  6	lakhs.	An advance of Rs. 1 1,000 was paid  by	the\nassessee.  The balance of Rs. 5,89,000 was to be paid by the\nassessee  on or before 25th September, 1955.  It was  agreed\nthat  Mr. A.  V. George should execute a sale-deed  himself\nor cause it to be executed Kailas Rubber Co. Ltd. on\n \nwhose behalf he was acting in favour of the assessee or	 his\nnominees.   The	 assessee subsequently divided the  area  of\n477.71	acres into 23 plots and found purchasers for  22  of\nthese,	plots.	 The total extent of 22 plots for  which  he\nfound  purchasers was 373.58 acres and the total price	paid\nby  the	 22 purchasers was Rs. 5,18,500.  A  sale  deed	 was\nexecuted  by the Mundakayam Valley Rubber Co. Ltd.  on	31st\nMarch, 1956.  It covered all the 23 plots.  The 22 plots for\nwhich  the  assessee found purchasers were conveyed  to	 the\nrespective purchasers and the 23rd plot was conveyed to	 the\nassesses  himself.  Mr. A. V. George and the  Kailas  Rubber\nCo. Ltd. were parties to this document.	 The plot which	 the\nassessee  had  retained	 for himself  was  104.13  acres  in\nextent.	  Its value was estimated by the Income Tax  Officer\nat  Rs.	 2,08,000.  The Income Tax Officer  worked  out	 the\nprofit from the transaction of purchase and sale of land  as\nfollows\n\"Sale price of 373 acres		Rs.   5,18,500\nValue of 104 acres retained by\nthe assessee at Rs. 2,000 per acre	   Rs. 2,08,000\n				   \n					  Rs. 7,26,500\n Less Cost				  Rs. 6,00,000\n				     \n					  Rs. 1,26,500\nThe  Income Tax Officer held that a sum of Rs.	1,25,000  in\nround  figures	represented the assessee&apos;s  profit  from  an\nadventure in the nature of trade and included this amount in\nhis  total  income under section 34(1)(a) of the  Act.	 The\nassessee  appealed to the Appellate  Assistant	Commissioner\nwho  rejected the appeal.  The assessee took the  matter  in\nfurther appeal to the Appellate Tribunal which also rejected\nthe   appeal  holding  that  the  amount  of  Rs.   1,25,000\nrepresented profit from an adventure in the nature of trade.\nAt  the	 instance  of the assessee  the	 Appellate  Tribunal\nstated a case to the High Court on the following question of\nlaw\n	      \"Whether on the facts and in the circumstances\n	      of  the case, the transactions  constituted  a\n	      venture in the nature of trade and the surplus\n	      of Rs. 1,25,000 was assessable to tax\nBy its. judgment dated 10th October, 1966, the High Court of\nKerala answered the question in the affirmative and  against\nthe assessee.  This appeal is brought by special leave	from\nthe  judgment  of  the	High Court  of	Kerala,	 dated	10th\nOctober, 1966 in Income Tax Reference No, 18 of 1965,\n \nThe  question whether a transaction is an adventure  in	 the\nnature	of trade must be decided on a consideration  of	 all\nthe relevant facts and circumstances which are proved in the\nparticular case.  The answer to the question does not depend\nupon  the application of any abstract rifle or principle  or\nformula but must depend upon the total impression and effect\nof  all the relevant facts and circumstances established  in\nthe  particular	 case.	In. California Copper  Syndicate  v.\nHarris,(1) Lord Justice Clerk, observed\n	      \"It  is  quite  a well  settled  principle  in\n	      dealing with questions of assessment of income\n	      tax  that	 where	the  owner  of	an  ordinary\n	      investment chooses to realise it, and  obtains\n	      a	 greater  price for it	than  he  originally\n	      acquired	it  at	the enhanced  price  is	 not\n	      profit  assessable to income tax.	 But  it  is\n	      equally well established that enhanced  values\n	      obtained	from  realisation or  conversion  of\n	      securities may be so assessable where what  is\n	      done is not merely a realisation or change  of\n	      investment,  but an act done in what is  truly\n	      the  carrying  on,  or  carrying	out,  of   a\n	      business.	  What is the line  which  separates\n	      the  two classes of cases may be difficult  to\n	      define,  and  each  case	must  be  considered\n	      according	 to  its facts; the question  to  be\n	      determined  being-Is the sum of gain that	 has\n	      been  made  a  mere enhancement  of  value  by\n	      realising	 a security or is it a gain made  in\n	      the  operation of business in carrying  out  a\n	      scheme for profit making ?\"\nBut  in judging the character of such  transactions  several\nfactors	 have been treated as significant in decided  cases.\nFor instance, if a transaction related to the business which\nis normally carried on by the assessee, though not  directly\na  part of it, an intention to launch upon an  adventure  in\nthe  nature  of trade may readily be  inferred.	  A  similar\ninference  would  arise where a commodity is  purchased	 and\nsub-divided,  altered,	treated or repaired and sold  or  is\nconverted  into	 a different commodity and then	 sold.	 The\nmagnitude of the transaction of purchase, the nature of	 the\ncommodity,  the	 subsequent dealings of	 the  assessee,	 the\nnature of the Organisation employed by the assessee and	 the\nmanner of disposal may be such that, the transaction may  be\nstamped	 with the character of a trading nature.  In  Martin\nv.  Lowry, (2) the assessee purchased a large  quantity of\naeroplane  linen and sold it in different lots, and for	 the\npurpose of  selling it started	an  advertising	 campaign,\nrented	offices	  engaged an advertising  manager,  a  linen\nexpert	and  a	staff of clerks.  maintained  account  books\nnormally used by a trader, and passed receipts add payment\n(1) [1904] 5 S.T.C. 159,16-66.\n(2) 11 Tax Cases 297.\n \nin  connection	with the linen through	a  separate  banking\naccount.,  It  was  held that the  assessee  carried  on  an\nadventure  in  the  nature of trade and so  the	 profit	 was\nliable to be taxed.  The same view was taken in Rutledge  v.\nCommissioners of Inland Revenue(1) in regard to an  assessee\nwho  purchased very cheaply a vast quantity of toilet  paper\nand   within  a	 short	time  thereafter  sold	 the   whole\nconsignment   at  a  considerable  profit.   Similarly,	  in\nCommissioner of Inland Revenue v. Fraser (2) the assessee, a\nwoodcutter,  bought  for resale, whisky in  bond,  in  three\n&apos;lots.	 He  sold it later on at considerable  profit.	 The\nassessee had never dealt in whisky before, he had no special\nknowledge  of  the  trade he did not take  delivery  of	 the\nwhisky	nor did he have it blended and advertised.  Even  so\nit  was	 held that the transaction was an adventure  in	 the\nnature	of  trade.  Lord President Normand observed  in	 the\ncourse of the judgment :\n	      \"It  is  in general more easy to hold  that  a\n	      single   transaction   entered  into   by	  an\n	      individual  in  the  line	 of  his  own  trade\n	      (although not part and parcel of his  ordinary\n	      business)	 is  an adventure in the  nature  of\n	      trade than to hold that a transaction  entered\n	      into by an individual outside the line of	 his\n	      own trade or occupation is an adventure in the\n	      nature of trade.	But what is a good deal more\n	      important	 is  the nature of  the	 transaction\n	      with reference to the commodity dealt in.	 The\n	      individual  who enters into a purchase  of  an\n	      article  or  commodity may have  in  view	 the\n	      resale  of it at a profit, and yet it  may  be\n	      that  is	not the only purpose  for  which  he\n	      purchased	 the article of the  commodity,	 nor\n	      the only purpose to which he might turn it  if\n	      favourable opportunity of sale does not occur.\n	      In some of the cases the purchase of a picture\n	      has been given as an illustration.  An amateur\n	      may  purchase  a picture with a  view  to	 its\n	      resale  at a profit, and yet he may  recognise\n	      at the time or afterwards that the  possession\n	      of   the	picture	 will  give  him   aesthetic\n	      enjoyment	 if he is unable ultimately,  or  at\n	      his chosen time, to realise it at a profit.  A\n	      man may purchase stocks and shares with a view\n	      to selling them at an early date at a  profit,\n	      but, if he does so, he is purchasing something\n	      which  is	 itself an investment,	a  potential\n	      source of revenue to him while he holds it.  A\n	      man may purchase land with a view to realising\n	      it  at a profit, but it also may yield him  an\n	      income  while he continues to hold it.  If  he\n	      continues	 to  hold it, there may	 be  also  a\n	      certain pride of possession But the  purchaser\n	      of  a  large  quantity  of  a  commodity	like\n	      whisky,  greatly	in excess of what  could  be\n	      used by\n	      (1) 14Tax Cases490.\n	      (2) 24 Tax Cases 498.\n \n	      himself,	his family and friends, a  commodity\n	      which  yields  no pride of  possession,  which\n	      cannot  be  turned  to account  except  by.  a\n	      process	of  realisation,  I   can   scarcely\n	      consider	to be other than an adventure  in  a\n	      transaction  in the nature of a trade;  and  I\n	      can find no single fact among those stated  by\n	      the  Commissioners which in any way  traverses\n	      that  view.  In my opinion, the fact that	 the\n	      transaction  was	not in the way	of  business\n	      (whatever it was) of the respondent in no	 way\n	      alters the character which almost	 necessarily\n	      belongs to a transaction like this\".\nThese are cases of commercial commodities but a	 transaction\nof purchase of land cannot be assumed without more to be  an\nadventure in the nature of trade.  In Leeming v. Jones,(1) a\nsyndicate  was	formed to acquire an option  over  a  rubber\nestate with a view to resell it at a profit, and finding the\nestate	too small the syndicate acquired another estate	 and\nsold  the  two	estates on profit.  It	was  held  that	 the\ntransaction  was not in the nature of trade and	 the  profit\nwas  not  liable to be assessed to tax.	 The same  view	 was\nexpressed in Saroj Kumar Mazumdar v. Commissioner of  Income\nTax  (2)  in which the assessee who carried on	business  of\nengineering   works   purchased	 land,	 which	 was   under\nrequisition by the Government, negotiated a sale before	 the\nland  was  de-requisitioned and sold it after the  land	 was\nreleased.   But the circumstances of a particular  case	 may\nlead to the conclusion that the purchaser resale of land  is\nin  the	 nature of trade.  In Venkataswami Naidu  &amp;  Co.  v.\nCommissioner of Income Tax(3) the appellant firm which acted\nas  managing agents purchas  the appellant was assessed for the assessment year 1956-57 on a total income of Rs. 8,400. The Income Tax Officer later on came to know that the assessee\'s income from the sale of estates had escaped assessment. The Income Tax Officer took action under section 34(1) (a) of the Income Tax Act, 1922 for the assessment year 1956-57 on 13th August, 1959. Under an agreement dated 18th May, 1955 a company called Mundakayam Valley Rubber Co. Ltd. sold and delivered an estate called Kuttikal Estate to one Mr. A. V. George. The area of the estate was 477 acres and 71 cents. Mr. A. V. George had entered into the agreement in his own name and on behalf of another company called the Kailas Rubber Co. Ltd. It was agreed that the vendor would execute the necessary conveyance in favour of Mr. A. V. George or his nominees. On 15th August. 1955. the assessee entered into an agreement with Mr. A. V. George whereby the assessee agreed to purchase 477.71 acres forming part of Kuttikal Estate for Rs. 6 lakhs. An advance of Rs. 1 1,000 was paid by the assessee. The balance of Rs. 5,89,000 was to be paid by the assessee on or before 25th September, 1955. It was agreed that Mr. A. V. George should execute a sale-deed himself or cause it to be executed Kailas Rubber Co. Ltd. on whose behalf he was acting in favour of the assessee or his nominees. The assessee subsequently divided the area of 477.71 acres into 23 plots and found purchasers for 22 of these, plots. The total extent of 22 plots for which he found purchasers was 373.58 acres and the total price paid by the 22 purchasers was Rs. 5,18,500. A sale deed was executed by the Mundakayam Valley Rubber Co. Ltd. on 31st March, 1956. It covered all the 23 plots. The 22 plots for which the assessee found purchasers were conveyed to the respective purchasers and the 23rd plot was conveyed to the assesses himself. Mr. A. V. George and the Kailas Rubber Co. Ltd. were parties to this document. The plot which the assessee had retained for himself was 104.13 acres in extent. Its value was estimated by the Income Tax Officer at Rs. 2,08,000. \r\nheld: he Income-tax authorities have correctly estimated the profit of the assessee by treating the land as stock-in-trade and valuing it according to the normal accountancy practice. \r\nappeal dismissed ','Bakhshish Singh Vs Union Of India (Uoi) And Ors. JUDGMENT\n  \n\nO. Chinnappa Reddy, J.\n \n\n1. Bakhshish Singh, the appellant, was appointed an Assistant in the Punjab Civil Secretariat on December 7, 1948 and was confirmed on September 1, 1956. Manohar Singh, Sardar Singh, D. Justin and Prithipal Singh Chawala, respondents 3 to 6 were also Assistants in &apos;. the Punjab Civil Secretariat, but were junior to the appellant. All of them were working as Assistants on November 1, 1956 when consequent on the State&apos;s Reorganisation Act, the former States of Punjab and PEPSU were merged into one State. On merger the conditions of service of those employed by the former States of Punjab and PEPSU were protected as provided by Sections 115(7) and 117 of the State&apos;s Reorganisation Act. The rules in force at that time, which governed them, were the Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Services Class III) Rules, 1952. Rule 6(1)(b) provided that posts of Superintendents, Records in the service were to be filled by selection among Assistants. Posts of Assistants-in-charge were to be filled (i) by promotion of Assistants; or (ii) by transfer or deputation of an official already in Government service. Rule 6 (1) (c) provided that posts of Assistants-in-charge were to be filled (i) by promotion of Assistants; or (ii) by transfer or deputation of an official already in Government service. Rule 6(I)(d) provided that the post of Superintendent, Military Secretary to Governor&apos;s office was to be filled by selection amongst\n Assistant. In October, 1963, the posts of Superintendents were made class II posts and came to be governed by the Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Service Class II) Rules. Rule 8(1)(a) provided that posts of Superintendents other than the Superintendent in the Press Branch were to be made (i) by promotion from amongst Deputy Superintendents, Assistants-in-charge and Assistants, who are members of the Punjab Civil Secretariat\n (State Service Class III) with minimum experience of one year as Deputy Superintendent or a total experience of 10 years as an Assistant; or (ii) by direct recruitment or by transfer or deputation of an official already in Government service holding a ministerial post. We are not concerned with the proviso to Rule 8(I)(a). Rule 8(I)(b) dealt with the post of Superintendent, Press Branch with which also we are not concerned. While this was so, as an experimental measure some posts of Assistant Section Officers were created which were not posts which belonged either to the Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Services Class III) or Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Services Class II). Appointment\n to these posts were to be made from Assistants belonging to the Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Services Class III) on the basis of an examination to be held by the Public Service Commission. Respondents 3 to 6 were selected and appointed as Assistant Section Officers as they were successful in the examination. The appellant either did not appear at the examination or was not successful at the examination. Therefore, he continued as Assistant in the Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Service Class III). By an order dated March 14, 1961, the Government expressly provided that the seniority of those appointed as Assistant Section Officers in their normal lines as Assistants will remain unchanged and that their promotion as Deputy Superintendents/Superintendents will be governed by their seniority as Assistants. Even so some Assistant Section Officers were promoted as Superintendents without reference to their seniority as Assistants. The promotions were quashed by the Punjab High Court in Roshan Lal Sharma&apos;s 1966 Ct. L J. 848 case. The State of Punjab thereupon thought fit to amend the Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Services Class II) by introducing a new Rule 8(I)(a)(i) in the place of the old Rule 8(I)(a)(i) which was as follows :-\n (i) By promotion from amongst Assistant Section Officers and such Deputy Superintendents, Assistants-in-charge and Assistants as are member of the Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Service Class III) with minimum experience of one year as a Deputy Superintendent or a total experience of ten years as an Assistant. \n \n\nTwo explanations were added and Explanation II provided that the number of posts of Superintendent and Section Officers available for promotion from amongst\n Assistant Section Officers shall bear the some proportion to the total number of such posts as the branch manned by Assistant Section Officers and Section Officers bear to the number of branches manned by Assistants and Superintendents, the method of promotion to vacancies available in such proportion being that persons, other than the Assistant Section Officers shall be promoted first and the Assistant Section Officers shall be promoted thereafter and so on. The Government of Punjab thought it advisable to obtain the approval of the Central Government as the High Court in Roshan Lal Sharma&apos;s case had said that the promotion of Assistant Section Officers to the posts of Superintendents based on their seniority as Assistant Section Officers was violative of the guarantees given by the State&apos;s Reorganisation Act. After seeking some clarification from the State Government, the Government of India wrote to the State Government as follows : -\n \n \n\nNo. 17/57/66-SR (S)\n \n\nGovernment of India/Ministry of Home Affairs.\n \n\nTo \n\nThe Chief Secretary to Government of Punjab, Secretariat Administration, Chandigarh.\n \n\nNew Delhi-1, the 20th May, 1967.\n \n\nSub : Integration of Services in Punjab-Rules for promotion to the post of Superintendent-Provision for promotion of Assistant Section Officers-Approval of the Central Government under the S.R.

In view of the fact that under the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, retrospective approval cann  Service- state of administration - Sections 115 and 117 of States Reorganization Act, 1956 and Rules 6 (I) and 8 (I) of Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Service Class III) Rules,1952 - claim against expulsion of request of testing advancement of respondents - respondents were junior to appellants - litigant fought ensure given to litigant by Sections115 (7) and 117 abused if there should be an occurrence of making of posts of Assistant Section Officers and by arrangement of advancement to posts of Superintendent in Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Service Class II) - making of new posts outside Class III administration and making people holding those posts qualified for advancement decreased odds of advancement of Assistants having a place with Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Service Class III) - there was no repudiation of Section 115 (7) - there was no adjustment in states of administration - respondents were youngsters to appealing party in framework of Assistants - appealing party did not profit himself of chance stood to him to qualify himself as Assistant Section Officer by passing recommended examination - appealing party can\'t be heard to whine that the individuals who were youngsters to him as Assistant have stolen walk over him - offer expelled.

She met with an accident on or about\n\n20.9.1999 while she was aged only 9 years. In the said accident she suffered\n\nthe following injuries, as stated in the application filed on her behalf before\n\nthe Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal :\n\n\n             1.     There is swelling deformity &amp; fracture of\n                    middle 3rd of Lt. thigh (femur shaft).\n             2.     Abrasion over left frontal region.\n \n\n             3.     Abrasion over Rt. Lateral aspect.\"\n\n\n3.    She was treated by two doctors. According to one of them, namely,\n\nDr. Mukund, who examined himself as PW3, she suffered 10% to 15% of\n\ndisability whereas according to the other doctor, Dr. Shivanand, she suffered\n\n20% to 25% of physical disability in her left lower limb.\n\n\n      An amount of Rs.3,00,000/- was claimed by her by way of\n\ncompensation in the claim petition before the Motor Accidents Claims\n\nTribunal under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereinafter\n\ncalled and referred to for the sake of brevity as `the Act&apos;). The Tribunal,\n\nhowever, having regard to the evidences brought on record, opining that\n\npermanent disability suffered by her would be 10%, a sum of Rs.40,000/-\n\nawarded on the said ground. The total amount of compensation determined\n\nwas a sum of Rs.72,785/- details of which are as under :\n\n\n                   \"Rs.18,000/- towards pain and sufferings\n             and agony, Rs. 12,460 towards diet and attendant\n             charges and Rs.323/- were awarded towards\n             medical expenses.\"\n\n\n4.    On an appeal preferred thereagainst, the High Court, without\n\nassigning any reason, enhanced the amount of compensation to\n\nRs.1,12,000/-, stating :\n \n\n            \"Petitioner could be awarded Rs.30,000/- for pain\n            and agony, Rs.10,000/- for medical and incidental\n            expenses relating to treatment, Rs.15,000/- for loss\n            of amenities and discomfort on account of\n            disability, Rs.27,000/- (1500 X 18) for loss of\n            future earnings on account of disability and\n            Rs.20,000/- for loss of marriage prospects on\n            account of disability.

On\n            the enhanced compensation, the interest payable\n            shall be 6% p.a. from the date of petition till\n            payment.\"\n\n\n5.    Appellant being aggrieved by and dissatisfied therewith is before us.\n\n\n6.    Mr. P.V.V. Shetty, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\nappellant, would contend that the High Court committed a serious error in\n\nawarding only a sum of Rs.1,12,000/- without taking into consideration her\n\nprospect of marriage. The amount of compensation on the basis of notional\n\nincome should not have been determined, urging that even if she was to\n\nwork as a labourer, she would have earned at Rs.4,000/- per month.\n\n\n7.    Indisputably, she was a child at that time. She had no earning. What\n\namount could be awarded towards future loss of earning or prospective loss\n\nof earning could not have been determined on the basis of any legal\n\nprinciple. Compensation for the injuries suffered by a person in a motor\n\nvehicle accident can be determined either on the basis of the actual damages\n\nsuffered or upon application of the structured formula. Although for the\n \n\npurpose of invoking the provisions of Section 163A of the Act, a legal\n\nprinciple may be found in the Second Schedule thereof.           The Second\n\nSchedule provides that where no income is proved, notional income for the\n\npurpose of payment of compensation to those who had no income prior to\n\naccident, a sum of Rs.15,000/- per annum would be considered as the\n\nmultiplicand. The multiplier which was required to be applied would be 15.\n\nParagraph 4 and 5 of the said Schedule reads as under :\n\n\n            \"4. General damages in case of injuries and\n            disabilities--\n            (i)    Pain and sufferings :\n                   (a) Grievous injuries\n                                                      Rs.5,000\n                   (b) Non-grievous injuries          Rs.1,000\n            (ii)   Medical expenses--actual expenses\n                   Incurred supported by bills/vouchers\n                   But not exceeding as onetime\n                   Payment                            Rs.15,000\n            5.

All the petitioners, in these three Writ Petitions filed under  Article\r\n    32 of the Constitution of India, are similarly situated. After  getting\r\n    the requisite training they have acquired the nomenclature of  \'trained\r\n    teachers\'. They  seek  an  appointments  in  the  schools  run  by  the\r\n    Respondent-State of Jharkhand as assistant teachers. Some IAs filed  by\r\n    several similarly situated teachers for  impleadment  and  seeking  the\r\n    same relief. It is for this reason that these petitions were conjointly\r\n    heard.\r\n 2. The exact prayer, contained in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 173  of  2010,\r\n    would give a glimpse of  the  nature  of  the  case  set  up  by  these\r\n    petitioners and the precise relief which these  petitioners  pray  for.\r\n    This prayer reads as under:\r\n               It is, therefore, respectfully prayed that Your  Lordships  may\r\n            graciously be pleased to:\r\n\r\n\r\n               i) Issue a writ, order or direction directing the respondents\r\n                  more particularly Respondent Nos. 1 to 3  to  appoint  the\r\n                  petitioners and similarly circumstanced  Trained  Teachers\r\n                  in order of seniority.\r\n\r\n\r\n              ii) Issue a writ, order or direction directing the respondents\r\n                  and more particularly the State of  Jharkhand  (Respondent\r\n                  Nos. 1 to 3)  to  protect  fundamental  right  of  Primary\r\n                  Education  to  the  children  of  State  of  Jharkhand  by\r\n                  appointing the Trained Teachers available in the Jharkhand\r\n                  State  on  the  sanctioned  vacant  posts   of   Assistant\r\n                  Teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n             iii) Pass such other or orders as this Honourable Court  may  deem\r\n                  fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of the  case\r\n                  and in the interests of justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  The background in which these petitions have come  to  be\r\n     filed is somewhat detailed one with chequered  history,  riddled  with\r\n     previous litigation  benefit  whereof  the  petitioners  are  seeking.\r\n     However, we would endeavour to traverse through  these  events  in  as\r\n     simple a manner as possible.\r\n     3.     As is well known, the State of Jharkhand  was  created  in  the\r\n     year 2000. Before that it was a part of the State of Bihar. All  these\r\n     petitioners belong to undivided Bihar vintage. They  claim  that  they\r\n     are  qualified   and   trained   teachers   who   acquired   requisite\r\n     qualification  and  underwent  necessary  training  and  thus   became\r\n     eligible to be considered for appointment as primary teachers  in  the\r\n     schools run by the State Government  as  per  the  provisions  of  the\r\n     Extant Rules on the subject. However, even  when  the  Government  was\r\n     legally bound to appoint only the trained teachers, on the basis of an\r\n     advertisement issued on 6.10.1991  by  the  Government  of  Bihar  for\r\n     filling up of 25,000 posts of Assistant Teachers, the State  recruited\r\n     17,281  untrained  teachers  out  of  total  appointments  of   19,272\r\n     Assistant  Teachers  made  in  the  said  recruitment  process.   This\r\n     selection was challenged by some persons by filing  writ  petition  in\r\n     the High Court of Judicature at Patna which was decided on  26.9.1996.\r\n     The High Court did not quash the appointments already made, though  at\r\n     the same time it held that the State  would  not  force  a  person  to\r\n     confine his application to a particular district. Against this  order,\r\n     Special Leave Petition No. 23187 of 1996  was  preferred  before  this\r\n     Court. In those proceedings an affidavit dated 14.8.1997 was filed  by\r\n     the Deputy Superintendent of Education, Bihar Government  agreeing  to\r\n     appoint trained teacher against existing vacancies. Having  regard  to\r\n     the averments made in the said affidavit, SLP  was  disposed  of  vide\r\n     order dated 5.9.1997. This case is known as Ram Vinay Kumar &amp; Ors.  v.\r\n     State of Bihar and  Ors.  (1998)  9  SCC  227.  The  exact  directions\r\n     regarding appointment to the post of  Assistant  Teachers  which  were\r\n     given by this Court are the following:\r\n              (i)  The Commission shall conduct a special selection  for  the\r\n           purpose of appointment of  these  unfilled  posts  from  amongst\r\n           applicants who had submitted their applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n           (ii)  The selection shall be confined to  applicants  possessing\r\n           teacher\'s  training/  qualification  obtained  from  government/\r\n           private teacher\'s training institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n           (iii) The selection shall be made by holding a preliminary  test\r\n           and a written examination of the candidates who qualify  in  the\r\n           preliminary test.\r\n\r\n\r\n       iv) In case the number of persons found suitable for appointment  in\r\n           such special selection exceeds the number  of  posts  for  which\r\n           recruitment was to be made on the basis of  advertisement  dated\r\n           6.10.1991, the surplus number of candidates who have been  found\r\n           suitable for the appointment would be justified against posts to\r\n           be filled on the basis of subsequent selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        v) The special selection which is to be conducted in  pursuance  of\r\n           these  directions  shall  be  completed  by  the  Commission  by\r\n           31.1.1997.   \r\n\r\n\r\n  4. In nut-shell, the direction was to conduct  a  special  selection  for\r\n     filling up of the unfilled posts from amongst the applicants  who  had\r\n     already submitted their applications  pursuant  to  the  advertisement\r\n     issued and it  was  to  be  confined  to  those  applicants  who  were\r\n     possessing teachers training/ qualification obtained from  Government/\r\n     private teachers\' training institution i.e. from amongst  the  trained\r\n     teachers. As per the petitioners as  on  30.9.1993  there  were  about\r\n     45,000 vacancies in as much as against total post of 2,09,981,  number\r\n     of teachers working were 1,54,751. Furthermore, in  next  three  years\r\n     about 18,431 teachers were expected to  retire.  Therefore,  projected\r\n     vacancies were approximately 63,000. On the creation of the  State  of\r\n     Jharkhand in terms of Bihar  Reorganisation  Act,  2000  proportionate\r\n     vacancies i.e. one-third came to the share of State of Jharkhand which\r\n     would mean that 21,000 vacancies were available on the date  on  which\r\n     this State was created.\r\n     5.     It is stated by the petitioners that for almost  7  years  from\r\n     the date of directions given in Ram Vinay Kumar\'s Case, no action  was\r\n     taken. It forced certain sections of trained teachers to approach  the\r\n     Patna High Court by way of several  Writ  Petitions.  All  these  Writ\r\n     Petitions were heard together with leading case known as Nand  Kishore\r\n     Ojha &amp; Ors. v. State of Bihar and Ors. (CWJC 13246/2003).  These  Writ\r\n     Petitions were allowed by the Patna High  Court  vide  judgment  dated\r\n     1.7.2004. In the said judgment it was inter alia noted that there were\r\n     number of unfilled vacancies because of  which  primary  schools  were\r\n     lying empty. The High Court deprecated the inaction on the part of the\r\n     Government of Bihar in not implementing the judgment of this Court  in\r\n     Ram Vinay Kumar\'s Case, on one pretext or the other, thereby  creating\r\n     a human rights problem in denying a  young  generation  its  right  to\r\n     basic education. According to the High Court, the solution was  simple\r\n     viz. to follow the judgment of this Court in Ram  Vinay  Kumar\'s  case\r\n     from where the circumstances has been left out. The  High  Court  also\r\n     calculated the number of existing  vacancies  in  the  manner  already\r\n     pointed out above.  On this basis direction was given to carry out the\r\n     selection process as per the mandate of this Court  contained  in  the\r\n     case of Ram Vinay Kumar.\r\n     6.     The State of Bihar challenged the aforesaid  judgment  of  High\r\n     Court by filing  Special  Leave  Petitions  in  this  Court.  However,\r\n     thereafter affidavit dated 18.1.2006 was filed by the Commissioner-cum-\r\n     Secretary, Education Department,  Government  of  Bihar  alongwith  an\r\n     application for withdrawal of those Special Leave  Petitions.  In  the\r\n     affidavit an undertaking was given that  only  trained  teachers  were\r\n     appointed as Assistant teachers in the State of Bihar.  Further  owing\r\n     to the reason that the number of available teachers in  the  State  of\r\n     Bihar were less than the available sanctioned post  and  no  test  for\r\n     selection was required. On the basis of this affidavit,  orders  dated\r\n     23.1.2006 were  passed  permitting  the  Government  to  withdraw  the\r\n     Special Leave Petitions.\r\n     7.     When the undertaking  given  in  the  said  affidavit  was  not\r\n     implemented  immediately  thereafter,  some  persons  filed   Contempt\r\n     Petition No. 207 of 2006 in this Court which was disposed of by orders\r\n     dated 19.3.2007 with a direction to the State of  Bihar  to  implement\r\n     its undertaking.\r\n            Operative part of the said order reads as under:\r\n              In paragraph 17 of the said affidavit in reply dated  7.2.2007,\r\n           it is stated that priority has been given to trained teachers in\r\n           appointment and only if trained teachers are  not  available  in\r\n           sufficient  numbers,  the  case  of   untrained   teachers   are\r\n           considered by the concerned  by  the  Panchayati  Raj  Institute\r\n           (PRI) to achieve the constitutional goal of free and  compulsory\r\n           education for children from age 6-14, and  in  this  regard  the\r\n           State of Bihar and other  answering  respondents  are  complying\r\n           with the orders of the High Court and  also  of  this  Court.  A\r\n           rejoinder has also been filed by the  petitioner  disputing  the\r\n           statements made by the State of Bihar  in  the  affidavit  dated\r\n           7.2.2007.\r\n                 In view of the categorical statement  now  made  that  the\r\n           priority will be given to the trained  teachers  in  appointment\r\n           and also the clarification made  in  paragraphs  19  to  222  of\r\n           aforesaid affidavit dated 7.2.2007, we direct the State of Bihar\r\n           to implement the undertaking given by the State of Bihar earlier\r\n           and also now by the present affidavit dated 7.2.2007  in  letter\r\n           and spirit by appointing the trained teachers on priority basis.\r\n                 The Contempt Petition is disposed of accordingly.   \r\n\r\n\r\n     8.     Still this undertaking was  not  complied  with  which  led  to\r\n     filing of another Contempt  Petition  No.  297  of  2007  titled  Nand\r\n     Kishore Ojha v. Anjani Kumar Singh  in which following interim  orders\r\n     dated 9.12.2009 were passed.\r\n              Accordingly, without issuing a Rule of Contempt, we direct that\r\n           the 34,540 vacancies shown as  available  in  the  advertisement\r\n           published in December, 2003,  be  filled  up  from  amongst  the\r\n           trained teachers who are available, in order  of  seniority.  As\r\n           indicated above, this is to be done on a one-time basis and must\r\n           not be taken as the regular practice to be followed.\r\n           Let the Contempt Petition be adjourned for a further  period  of\r\n           six weeks to enable the State Government to implement this order\r\n           and to submit a report on the next date as to the result of  the\r\n           discussions  held  between  the  petitioner  and  the  concerned\r\n           authorities.   \r\n\r\n\r\n     9.     Thereafter, the State of Bihar filled up  the  vacant  post  of\r\n     Assistant Teachers in terms of its undertaking thereby recruiting from\r\n     amongst the trained teachers who had applied earlier, pursuant to  the\r\n     advertisement given in the year 1991. Many had become over aged in the\r\n     meantime, and age relaxation was given in their cases.\r\n     10.    What is narrated above is the  history  of  litigation  in  the\r\n     State of  Bihar.  In  so  far  as  State  of  Jharkhand  is  concerned\r\n     (respondent herein),  as  already  pointed  out  above,  approximately\r\n     21,000 vacant post were transferred  to  this  State.  The  respondent\r\n     advertised these vacancies in the year 2002 by  giving  relaxation  in\r\n     age by 5 years only. Because of this reason many trained teachers,  in\r\n     which category of the petitioners include, could not be  appointed  as\r\n     Assistant Teachers, being overage. The petitioners, in this  backdrop,\r\n     contend that they are entitled to the benefit  of  Ram  Vinay  Kumar\'s\r\n     judgment of this Court  rendered  much  before  the  creation  of  the\r\n     Jharkhand State and applied to the erstwhile  unified  Bihar  and  the\r\n     judgment be implemented in their case as well as it has  happened  qua\r\n     the trained teachers in State of Bihar in the manner explained  above.\r\n     We may point out  at  this  stage  that  respondent  State  is  making\r\n     appointment only from amongst trained teachers. The problem,  however,\r\n     has arisen because fo the reason that these  petitioners  have  become\r\n     over aged and wanted total age relaxation. To put it, succinctly  they\r\n     are claiming parity with their counterparts in the State of Bihar  and\r\n     submitting that when those  teachers  were  appointed  by  giving  age\r\n     relaxation, there is no reason to deprive  the  petitioners  from  the\r\n     same treatment which would, otherwise, be discriminatory and violative\r\n     of Article 14 of the Constitution.\r\n     11.    The petitioners have pointed out that the respondent-State  had\r\n     set up a Committee in the year 2001 for implementation of the judgment\r\n     and even the said Committee in its report dated 31.5.2001  recommended\r\n     that all vacancies in the State of Jharkhand be  filled  with  trained\r\n     teachers  within  two  months.  The  operative  portion  of  the  said\r\n     recommendation reads as under:\r\n              Since the Government at its own  level  have  imparted  teacher\r\n           training to the thousands and the trained teachers were  in  the\r\n           hope for the two decades  that  they  will  be  appointed  as  a\r\n           teacher.  It  is  totally  unjustified  and  in-human  that  the\r\n           Government appoints untrained persons  and  thereby  ruined  the\r\n           future of trained teachers. Therefore,  the  committee  here  by\r\n           recommends that all the vacancies in the State of  Jharkhand  be\r\n           fulfill with trained teachers within  2  months.  If  number  of\r\n           trained teachers exceeds  the  number  of  vacancies,  then  the\r\n           vacancies be fulfilled on the basis of seniority of the  trained\r\n           teachers  i.e.  in  the  order  of   their   getting   training.\r\n           Thereafter,  the  trained  teachers   remained   unemployed   be\r\n           appointed  against  subsequent  vacancies.  In  the  appointment\r\n           process the  All the petitioners, in the Writ Petitions filed under&nbsp;Article 32&nbsp;of the Constitution of India, are similarly situated. After getting the requisite training they have acquired the nomenclature of \'trained teachers\'. They seek an appointments in the schools run by the Respondent-State of Jharkhand as assistant teachers. Some IAs filed by several similarly situated teachers for impleadment and seeking the same relief. It is for this reason that these petitions were conjointly heard.The direction was to conduct a special selection for filling up of the unfilled posts from amongst the applicants who had already submitted their applications pursuant to the advertisement issued and it was to be confined to those applicants who were possessing teachers training/ qualification obtained from Government/ private teachers\' training institution i.e. from amongst the trained teachers.&nbsp;The High Court deprecated the inaction on the part of the Government of Bihar in not implementing the judgment of this Court .The High Court also calculated the number of existing vacancies .The State of Bihar challenged the aforesaid judgment of High Court by filing Special Leave Petitions in this Court.Thereafter, the State of Bihar filled up the vacant post of Assistant Teachers in terms of its undertaking thereby recruiting from amongst the trained teachers who had applied earlier, pursuant to the advertisement given in the year 1991. Many had become over aged in the meantime, and age relaxation was given in their cases.Having regard to the above it would not be permissible to the petitioners to compare their case with their counterparts in Bihar. As far as the counterparts in the State of Bihar are concerned they had filed writ petitions well in time i.e. way back in the year 2003 in Patna High Court wherein those persons succeeded. The Patna High Court allowed those writ petitions vide judgment dated 1.7.2004 directing the State of Bihar to implement the judgment in Ram Vinay Kumar\'s Case. In such circumstances this Court would not be inclined to grant any relief to the petitioners in these petitions filed under&nbsp;Article 32&nbsp;of the Constitution, more so when it is found that the respondent/ State of Jharkhand has taken steps in conformity with the statutory recruitment rules framed under proviso to&nbsp;Article 309&nbsp;of the Constitution.Finding no merits in these writ petitions, same were dismissed. All pending I.As also stand dismissed. I.As Disposed','Punjab State Warehousing Corp Vs Bhushan Chander & Anr Dipak Misra, J.\r\n\r\n\r\n      The singular question that has emanated in  this  appeal,  by  special\r\nleave, is whether the High  Court  has  correctly  accepted  the  submission\r\nadvanced on behalf of the first respondent, who was convicted  for  offences\r\npunishable under Section 409/467/468/471 of  the  Indian  Penal  Code,  1860\r\n(for short,    IPC   ) and had been awarded sentence for each  of  the  offences\r\nwith the stipulation that they would run  concurrently,  that  he  being  an\r\nemployee of the appellant Corporation is a public servant and the trial  had\r\ncommenced without obtaining sanction  under  Section  197  of  the  Code  of\r\nCriminal Procedure, 1973  (CrPC)  and  hence,  the  trial  in  entirety  was\r\ninvalid and as a result the conviction  and  sentence  deserved  to  be  set\r\naside.\r\n2.    As far as the factual narration is  concerned,  suffice  it  to  state\r\nthat the Managing Director of  the  Corporation  had  written  a  letter  on\r\n28.6.1989 to the concerned police authority to register a case  against  the\r\nfirst respondent for offences punishable under Sections 409/467/468 and  471\r\nof  the  IPC  or  any  other   appropriate   provision   of   law.    During\r\ninvestigation, the investigating agency  found  that  the  accused  who  was\r\nworking as a Godown Assistant in  the  Corporation  had  misappropriated  11\r\ngunny bales value of which was Rs.38,841/-; that he had  tampered  with  the\r\nrecord of the department; and accordingly the police authorities  filed  the\r\ncharge-sheet for the  aforesaid  offences  before  the  court  of  competent\r\nJudicial Magistrate.  The  learned  Magistrate  on  the  basis  of  evidence\r\nbrought on record, found that the prosecution had been able  to  bring  home\r\nthe guilt against the  accused  and  accordingly  sentenced  him  to  suffer\r\nrigorous imprisonment for three years under Section 467 and 409 IPC and  two\r\nyears under Section 468/471 IPC with separate default clauses. The  judgment\r\nof conviction and order of  sentence  was  assailed  in  appeal  before  the\r\nlearned Session Judge, Firozpur and the matter  was  finally  heard  by  the\r\nlearned Additional Session Judge, who appreciating the evidence  on  record,\r\nconcurred with the conviction but  modified  the  sentence  of  three  years\r\nimposed under Section 409 and 467 IPC to two years.\r\n3.    Being dissatisfied, the first respondent preferred  Criminal  Revision\r\nNo. 359/2001 in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh.   Before\r\nthe revisional court, the only contention that was raised pertained to  non-\r\nobtaining of sanction under Section 197 CrPC.   It  was  argued  before  the\r\nlearned Single Judge that in view of the decisions in State  of  Maharashtra\r\nv. Dr. Budhikota Subbarao[1], Rakesh Kumar Mishra  v.  State  of  Bihar  and\r\nothers[2], Sankaran Moitra v. Sadhna Das and another[3],  Om  Kumar  Dhankar\r\nv. State of Haryana[4], the requisite sanction  having  not  been  obtained,\r\nthe trial was vitiated.  On behalf of the Corporation as well as  the  State\r\nof Punjab, it was argued that the sanction under Section 197  CrPC  was  not\r\nnecessary to prosecute the first respondent and  to  substantiate  the  said\r\nstand, reliance was  placed  on  Dr.  Lakshmansingh  Himatsingh  Vaghela  v.\r\nNaresh Kumar Chadrrashanker Jah[5], N. Bhargavan Pillai (dead) by  Lrs.  and\r\nanother v. State of Kerala[6],   State  of  U.P.  v.  Paras  Nath  Singh[7],\r\nRaghunath Anant Govilkar v. State of Maharashtra[8]  and  Choudhury  Parveen\r\nSultana v. State of West Bengal[9].\r\n4.    The learned Single Judge referred to the charges framed under  Section\r\n409 and 467 IPC.  He also referred  to  the  authorities  in  Prakash  Singh\r\nBadal v. State of Punjab[10], Nirmal Singh Kahlon v.  State  of  Punjab[11],\r\nOm Kumar Dhankar (supra) and Bakshish Singh  Brar  v.  Gurmel  Kaur[12]  and\r\nanalyzing Section 197 CrPC observed that the  said  provision  is  meant  to\r\nprotect responsible public servants against  the  institution  of  vexatious\r\ncriminal proceedings for offences alleged to have been  committed  by  them.\r\nThe learned Single Judge referred to P. Arulswami v.  State  of  Madras[13],\r\nMatajog Dube v.  H.C.  Bahri[14],  P.K.  Pradhan  v.  State  of  Sikkim[15],\r\nreproduced a passage from B. Saha v. M.S. Kochar[16], and came  to  hold  as\r\nfollows:-\r\n   So far as the commission of offence in this case  is  concerned,  the  very\r\nallegation would clearly reveal that it is not a case where the  allegations\r\nare in any other capacity than a public  servant.   The  allegation  against\r\nthe petitioner is that while being a public  servant,  he  had  committed  a\r\ncriminal breach of trust.  It is only in the  performance  of  the  official\r\nduty that the  petitioner  is  alleged  to  have  been  found  with  certain\r\ndeficiencies for which allegation of criminal breach of trust  as  well  has\r\nbeen made against him.  Certainly the facts in this  case  are  inextricably\r\nmingled with the official duty of the petitioner to be considered  severable\r\nto call for dispensing with the requirement of sanction   .\r\n\r\n5.    After so stating, the revisional court distinguished the  decision  in\r\nParas Nath Singh (supra)  which  was  relied  upon  by  the  prosecution  by\r\nstating thus:-\r\n   The aggrieved  person  in  the  said  case  has  faced  trial  for  alleged\r\ncommission of the offences punishable under Section 409, 420,  461  and  468\r\nIPC.  The Supreme Court in  this  case  has  drawn  difference  between  the\r\nofficial duty and doing something by public servant in  the  course  of  his\r\nservice.  It is observed that the section does  not  extend  its  protective\r\ncover to act or omission done by a public servant in service, but  restricts\r\nits scope of operation to only those acts or omissions, which are done by  a\r\npublic servant in discharge of official duty.  Even this observation of  the\r\nHon   ble Supreme Court would fully apply to the facts of  the  present  case.\r\nHere, the petitioner is alleged to have committed this offence not  only  as\r\na public servant but is stated to have done so in discharge of his  official\r\nduty.   In discharge of his official duty, the petitioner  was  required  to\r\nprotect stock, which he failed to do so and so he is asked  to  account  for\r\nthe same   .\r\n\r\n6.    The eventual conclusion recorded by the learned  Single  Judge  is  to\r\nthe following effect:-\r\n   Under normal circumstances, the offence under Sections 467/468/471 IPC  may\r\nbe of such a nature that requirement of  obtaining  sanction  under  Section\r\n197 CrPC may not be called for.  The offences in this case have been  inter-\r\nconnected with  the  main  offence  alleged  against  the  petitioner  under\r\nSection 409 IPC and it would clearly indicate that these offences could  not\r\nbe separately treated or dealt  with.   Requirement  of  obtaining  sanction\r\nwould be needed for an offence under Section 409 IPC and the  same  may  not\r\nbe separated from the remaining offences   .\r\n\r\n7.    After so stating, the learned Single Judge ruled that the  Corporation\r\nis a fully government-owned  and  financed  by  the  State  Government  and,\r\ntherefore, he is a public servant as per the definition  of  Section  21  of\r\nIPC and, therefore, his employment in the Corporation would confer  him  the\r\nstatus of public servant for which sanction is  necessary.   The  revisional\r\ncourt has not adverted to any of the aspects touching  merits  of  the  case\r\nand, therefore, we refrain from entering into the said arena.\r\n8.    Section 197(1) and  (2)  CrPC  which  are  relevant  for  the  present\r\npurpose are reproduced below:-\r\n   197. Prosecution of Judges and public servants.   (1) When any person who  is\r\nor was a Judge or Magistrate or a public  servant  not  removable  from  his\r\noffice save by or with the sanction of the  Government  is  accused  of  any\r\noffence alleged to have been committed by him while acting or purporting  to\r\nact in the discharge of his official duty, no court  shall  take  cognizance\r\nof such  offence  except  with  the  previous  sanction  save  as  otherwise\r\nprovided in the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013   \r\n\r\n(a) in the case of a person who is employed or, as the case may be,  was  at\r\nthe time of commission of the alleged offence employed, in  connection  with\r\nthe affairs of the Union, of the Central Government;\r\n\r\n(b) in the case of a person who is employed or, as the case may be,  was  at\r\nthe time of commission of the alleged offence employed, in  connection  with\r\nthe affairs of a State, of the State Government:\r\n\r\nProvided that where the alleged offence was committed by a  person  referred\r\nto in clause (b) during the period while a proclamation issued under  clause\r\n(1) of Article 356 of the Constitution was in force in a State,  clause  (b)\r\nwill apply as if for the expression    State  Government     occurring  therein,\r\nthe expression    Central Government    were substituted.\r\n\r\nExplanation.   For the removal  of  doubts  it  is  hereby  declared  that  no\r\nsanction shall be required in case  of  a  public  servant  accused  of  any\r\noffence alleged to have been committed under Section 166-A,  Section  166-B,\r\nSection 354, Section 354-A, Section 354-B,  Section  354-C,  Section  354-D,\r\nSection 370,  Section  375,  Section  376,  Section  376-A,  Section  376-C,\r\nSection 376-D or Section 509 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860).\r\n\r\n(2)   No Court shall take cognizance of any offence  alleged  to  have  been\r\ncommitted by any member of the Armed Forces of the  Union  while  acting  or\r\npurporting to act in the discharge of his official  duty,  except  with  the\r\nprevious sanction of the Central Government.   \r\n\r\n9.    In Matajog Dube (supra), certain complaints were alleged  against  the\r\nauthorized  officials  on  the  ground  that  the  officials  had  committed\r\noffences  punishable  under  Sections  323,  341,  342  and  109  IPC.   The\r\nofficials were arrayed as accused persons who were authorized to search  two\r\npremises in question.  The trial Magistrate discharged the  accused  persons\r\nfor want of sanction under Section 197 CrPC.  Similar order  was  passed  by\r\nanother trial Magistrate.  Both the orders were concurred with by  the  High\r\nCourt.  Be it noted two cases had arisen as two complaints were  filed.   It\r\nwas contended before  this  Court  that  the  act  of  criminal  assault  or\r\nwrongful confinement can never be regarded  as  act  done  while  acting  or\r\npurporting to act in the  discharge  of  official  duty  and  that  duty  is\r\nclearly defined in the statute.  The  Constitution  Bench  referred  to  two\r\ndecisions  of  the  Federal  Court  and  the  decisions  of  this  Court  in\r\nShreekantiah Ramayya Munipalli v. State of Bombay[17]  and  Amrik  Singh  v.\r\nState of Pepsu[18] and analyzing the earlier authorities opined that:-\r\n   The result of foregoing discussion is this:  There  must  be  a  reasonable\r\nconnection between the act and the discharge of official duty; the act  must\r\nbear such relation to the duty that the accused could lay a  reasonable  but\r\nnot a pretended or fanciful claim, that he did  it  in  the  course  of  the\r\nperformance of his duty   .\r\n\r\n10.   Thereafter, the  Court  adverted  to  the  determination  of  need  of\r\nsanction and the relevant  stage.   We  are  not  concerned  with  the  said\r\naspects in the present case.\r\n11.    In  Arulswami  (supra),  the  President  of  a  Panchayat  Board  was\r\nconvicted under Section 409 IPC by the High Court which had  overturned  the\r\ndecision of the lower court.  It was argued before the High Court  that  the\r\nprosecution  was  not  maintainable  for  want  of  sanction  by  the  State\r\nGovernment under Section 106 of the Madras Village Panchayats  Act   (Madras\r\nAct X of 1950).  The High Court held that no sanction of the Government  was\r\nnecessary as the appellant had ceased to hold the office of  the  President,\r\nwhen the prosecution was launched and  further  that  the  sanction  of  the\r\nCollector was sufficient in law.  That apart, this Court posed the  question\r\nwhether the sanction of the Government under Section 106 of the  Madras  Act\r\nwas necessary for the prosecution of the appellant  for  the  offence  under\r\nSection 409 IPC.  To appreciate the contention raised,  the  Court  referred\r\nto Section 197 CrPC.  The three-Judge Bench referred  to  the  decisions  in\r\nHori Ram Singh v. Emperor[19] and H.H.B. Gill v. The King[20].   The  three-\r\nJudge Bench quoted the observations of Lord  Simonds  made  in  H.H.B.  Gill\r\n(supra) in approving the statement of law made in Hori Ram  Singh   (supra).\r\nThe Court also took note of the  fact  that  the  decision  in  H.H.B.  Gill\r\n(supra) had been approved in Albert West Meads v.  The  King[21],  Phanindra\r\nChandra v. The King[22] and R. W. Mathams v. State of  West  Bengal[23]  and\r\neventually held:-\r\n   It is not therefore every  offence  committed  by  a  public  servant  that\r\nrequires sanction for prosecution under S. 197(1) of the Criminal  Procedure\r\nCode; nor even every act done by him while he is  actually  engaged  in  the\r\nperformance of his  official  duties;  but  if  the  act  complained  of  is\r\ndirectly concerned with his official  duties  so  that,  if  questioned,  it\r\ncould be claimed to have been done by virtue of the  office,  then  sanction\r\nwould be necessary.  It is the quality of the act that is important  and  if\r\nit falls within the scope and range of his official  duties  the  protection\r\ncontemplated by S. 197 of the Criminal Procedure  Code  will  be  attracted.\r\nAn office may be entirely unconnected with the official duty as such  or  it\r\nmay be committed within the  scope  of  the  official  duty.   Where  it  is\r\nunconnected with the official duty there can be no protection   .\r\n12.   The Court while arriving at the said conclusion also  placed  reliance\r\non Om Prakash Gupta v. State of U.P.[24] and ultimately came  to  hold  that\r\nthe sanction of the Government is  not  necessary  for  prosecution  of  the\r\naccused under Section 409 IPC.\r\n13.   The aforesaid two authorities  make  it  clear  that  no  sanction  is\r\nneeded to launch the prosecution for the offence  punishable  under  Section\r\n409 IPC.  As we notice from the impugned judgment, the learned Single  Judge\r\nhas been swayed away by what has been stated in B.  Saha  (supra).   In  the\r\nsaid  case,  the  appellants  had  sought  discharge  on  the  ground   that\r\ncognizance of the complaint had been taken without obtaining sanction  under\r\nSection 197 CrPC and Section 155 of the Customs Act, 1962.   The  Magistrate\r\nhad accepted the objection relying on the decision in  Shreekantiah  Ramayya\r\nMunipalli (supra).  The said order was challenged by the complainant  before\r\nthe High Court and the learned  Single  Judge,  after  elaborate  discussion\r\nopined that no sanction was required for the  prosecution  of  the  accused-\r\nappellants for the offence under Sections 120-B/409 IPC  because  they  were\r\ncertainly not acting in the discharge of their official  duties,  when  they\r\nmisappropriated the goods.  The three-Judge Bench analyzing  the  ambit  and\r\nscope of Section 197 CrPC opined that the  words     any  offence  alleged  to\r\nhave been committed by  him  while  acting  or  purporting  to  act  in  the\r\ndischarge of his official duty    employed in Section 197(1) of the Code,  are\r\ncapable of a narrow as well as a wide interpretation.   If  the  said  words\r\nare  construed  too  narrowly,  the  section  will  be  rendered  altogether\r\nsterile, for,    it is no part of an official duty to commit an  offence,  and\r\nnever can be   . The Court proceeded to observe that in the wider  sense,  the\r\nsaid words  will  take  under  their  umbrella  every  act  constituting  an\r\noffence, committed in the course  of  the  same  transaction  in  which  the\r\nofficial duty is performed  or  purports  to  be  performed  and  the  right\r\napproach to the import of these  words  lies  between  these  two  extremes.\r\nWhile on the one hand, it  is  not  every  offence  committed  by  a  public\r\nservant while engaged in the performance of  his  official  duty,  which  is\r\nentitled to the  protection  of  Section  197(1),  an  act  constituting  an\r\noffence, directly and reasonably  connected  with  his  official  duty  will\r\nrequire sanction for  prosecution  under  the  said  provision.   The  Court\r\nreferred to the observations of Ramaswami,  J.,  in  Baijnath  v.  State  of\r\nM.P.[25], which is to the following effect:-\r\n   it is the quality of the act that is important, and if it falls within  the\r\nscope and range of his  official  duties,  the  protection  contemplated  by\r\nSection 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code will be attracted   .\r\n\r\n      After  The Managing Director of the Corporation had written a letter on 28.6.1989 to the concerned police authority to register a case against the first respondent for offences punishable under&nbsp;Sections 409/467/468&nbsp;and&nbsp;471&nbsp;of the IPC or any other appropriate provision of law. During investigation, the investigating agency found that the accused who was working as a Godown Assistant in the Corporation had misappropriated 11 gunny bales value of which was Rs.38,841/-; that he had tampered with the record of the department; and accordingly the police authorities filed the charge-sheet for the aforesaid offences before the court of competent Judicial Magistrate. The learned Magistrate on the basis of evidence brought on record, found that the prosecution had been able to bring home the guilt against the accused and accordingly sentenced him to suffer rigorous imprisonment for three years under&nbsp;Section 467&nbsp;and&nbsp;409&nbsp;IPC and two years under&nbsp;Section 468/471&nbsp;IPC with separate default clauses. The judgment of conviction and order of sentence was assailed in appeal before the learned Session Judge, Firozpur and the matter was finally heard by the learned Additional Session Judge, who appreciating the evidence on record, concurred with the conviction but modified the sentence of three years imposed under&nbsp;Section 409&nbsp;and&nbsp;467&nbsp;IPC to two years.Being dissatisfied, the first respondent preferred Criminal Revision No. 359/2001 in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh. Before the revisional court, the only contention that was raised pertained to non- obtaining of sanction under&nbsp;Section 197&nbsp;CrPC.The Supreme Court in the case had drawn difference between the official duty and doing something by public servant in the course of his service.&nbsp;Here, the petitioner was alleged to have committed the offence not only as a public servant but was stated to have done so in discharge of his official duty. In discharge of his official duty, the petitioner was required to protect stock, which he failed to do so and so he was asked to account for the sameâ€.In view of the aforesaid analysis, the irresistible conclusion was that the respondents were not entitled to have the protective umbrella of&nbsp;Section 197&nbsp;CrPC and, therefore, the High Court has erred in setting aside the conviction and sentence on the ground that the trial is vitiated in the absence of sanction. Consequently, Supreme Court allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment and order passed by the High Court and remit the matter to the High Court to decide the revision petition in accordance with law.

In this batch of cases the question which arises for\r\n\r\ndetermination       is:   whether    BSE    Membership           Card   can   be\r\n\r\nconsidered     an    intangible         asset   for        the    purpose      of\r\n\r\ndepreciation    under      Section      32(1)(ii)     of    the    Income     Tax\r\n\r\nAct, 1961 (for short \"the 1961 Act\")?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFacts in M/s Techno Shares &amp; Stocks Ltd. [Lead matter]\r\n\r\n3.    In this case, we are concerned with the Assessment\r\n\r\nYears 1999-2000, 2000-2001, 2001-2002 and 2002-2003. The\r\n\r\nassessee   company        filed   its    Return     of     income       for   the\r\n \r\n\r\nAssessment      Year    1999-2000         disclosing     a    loss      of    Rs.\r\n\r\n10,77,276/-. The return was processed under Section 143(1)\r\n\r\non November 8, 2000. The case stood reopened under Section\r\n\r\n147 and Notice u/s 148 stood issued to the assessee on\r\n\r\n16.7.2002. The assessee filed its return of income under\r\n\r\nprotest. The assessee filed its return of income pursuant\r\n\r\nto the Notice u/s 148 once again declaring loss of Rs.\r\n\r\n10,77,276/-, the same as was in the original return of\r\n\r\nincome. The main reason for reopening of assessment under\r\n\r\nSection 147 was the claim of depreciation by the assessee\r\n\r\non BSE membership card amounting to Rs. 23,65,000/-. The\r\n\r\nclaim of depreciation of the assessee was based on Section\r\n\r\n32(1)(ii) which stood inserted by Finance (No. 2) Act,\r\n\r\n1998 w.e.f. 1.4.1999. However, the said Section deals with\r\n\r\nclaim    for   depreciation          of   items   acquired    on       or    after\r\n\r\n1.4.1998.      The assessee claimed before the A.O. that the\r\n\r\nBSE     membership     card    is     a    \"licence\"     or   \"business         or\r\n\r\ncommercial right of similar nature\" u/s 32(1)(ii) and is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, an intangible asset eligible for depreciation\r\n\r\nu/s 32(1)(ii) which submission was not accepted by the\r\n\r\nA.O.      It   was   held     that    membership    is   only      a   personal\r\n\r\npermission which is non-transferable and which does not\r\n\r\ndevolve automatically on legal heirs and, therefore, it is\r\n \r\n\r\nnot a privately owned asset.               That, there is no ownership\r\n\r\nof an asset and that what ultimately can be sold is only a\r\n\r\nRight to Nomination.           Further, according to the A.O., in\r\n\r\nthe case of BSE membership, there is no obsolescence, wear\r\n\r\nand tear or diminution in value by its use, hence, the\r\n\r\nassessee     was   not     entitled        to    claim     depreciation            u/s\r\n\r\n32(1)(ii).     This decision of the A.O. stood affirmed by\r\n\r\nC.I.T. (A) in the appeal filed by the assessee.\r\n\r\n4.    Aggrieved      by    the      said    decision       of    CIT    (A),       the\r\n\r\nassessee   carried       the   matter      in    appeal    to    the        Tribunal\r\n\r\nwhich took the view that since the assessee had acquired a\r\n\r\nright to trade on the floor of BSE through the membership\r\n\r\ncard, it was not entitled to depreciation u/s 32(1)(ii) of\r\n\r\nthe 1961 Act.        That, the said Card is a capital asset\r\n\r\nthrough    which   right       to   trade       on   the   floor       of    BSE    is\r\n\r\nacquired     and   since       it   is     intangible       asset       the     said\r\n\r\nassessee was entitled to depreciation u/s 32(1)(ii).\r\n\r\n5.    Against the said decision, the Department carried\r\n\r\nthe matter in appeal to the High Court which came to the\r\n\r\nconclusion,    following        certain     decisions       of     this       Court,\r\n\r\nthat the BSE membership card is only a personal privilege\r\n\r\ngranted to a member to trade in shares on the floor of the\r\n\r\nStock Exchange; that, such a privilege cannot be equated\r\n \r\n\r\nwith the expression \"licence\" or \"any other business or\r\n\r\ncommercial rights of similar nature\" u/s 32(1)(ii); that,\r\n\r\nthere     is    a   difference       between    acquiring       a    know-how,\r\n\r\npatent, copyright or trademark and acquiring a licence to\r\n\r\nuse     such     know-how,     patent,     copyright,       trademark         or\r\n\r\nfranchise;       that   the   expression       \"business    or      commercial\r\n\r\nrights of similar nature\" in Section 32(1)(ii) of the 1961\r\n\r\nAct   would      take   its    colour    from    the    preceding         words,\r\n\r\nnamely,        know-how,      patent,    copyright,        trademark         and\r\n\r\nfranchise which belong to a class of intellectual property\r\n\r\nrights and applying the rule of ejusdem generis, the High\r\n\r\nCourt held that the expression \"licence\" as well as the\r\n\r\nexpression       \"business     and    commercial       rights       of   similar\r\n\r\nnature\" in Section 32(1)(ii) of the 1961 Act are referable\r\n\r\nto IPRs such as know-how, patent, copyright, trademark and\r\n\r\nfranchise and since the BSE membership card does not fall\r\n\r\nin any of the above categories, the claim for depreciation\r\n\r\nwas not admissible on the BSE membership card acquired by\r\n\r\nthe   assessee      u/s    32(1)(ii).     Consequently,         the      appeals\r\n\r\nfiled by the Department stood allowed, hence, these civil\r\n\r\nappeals.\r\n\r\nImportance of BSE:\r\n\r\n6.       BSE is recognized by the Government of India under\r\n \r\n\r\nSecurities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956. Approximately\r\n\r\n70000 deals are executed on a daily basis. There are about\r\n\r\n3500     companies    which     are    listed    on   BSE.     The     market\r\n\r\ncapitalization of the BSE is Rs. 5 trillion. The main aim\r\n\r\nand object of the BSE is to provide a market place for the\r\n\r\npurchase    and   sale     of   securities.      It   aims     to    promote,\r\n\r\ndevelop and maintain a well regulated market for dealing\r\n\r\nin   securities      and   to   safeguard       the   interests       of    the\r\n\r\nmembers and the investing public having dealings in the\r\n\r\nExchange. It helps industrial development of the country\r\n\r\nthrough resources mobilization. It is set up to establish\r\n\r\nand promote \"just practices\" in securities transactions.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1996, the BSE constituted a Trade Guarantee\r\n\r\nScheme    under    which    all    trades    carried     out    on     online\r\n\r\ntrading    are    guaranteed      by   the   clearing    house       of    BSE.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, a depository has been set up as a joint venture\r\n\r\nbetween BSE and Bank of India etc. BSE has introduced\r\n\r\ntrading also in fixed income securities to give impetus to\r\n\r\ntrading in debentures and corporate debt instruments to\r\n\r\nincrease trading in Government owned securities.\r\n\r\nQuestion arising in the Present Matters:\r\n\r\n7.     Is depreciation allowable on the cost of a Stock\r\n\r\n       Exchange Membership Card under Section 32(1)(ii)\r\n \r\n\r\n     of the Income Tax Act, 1961, which was enacted and\r\n\r\n     inserted by Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnswer to the above Question:\r\n\r\n8.     To   answer   the    above    question,   we   need   to   quote\r\n\r\nhereinbelow certain relevant provisions of the 1961 Act:\r\n\r\n     2. In this      Act,   unless    the   context    otherwise\r\n     requires,--\r\n\r\n     (14)\"capital asset\" means property of any kind\r\n     held by an assessee, whether or not connected with\r\n     his business or profession, but does not include--\r\n\r\n            (i)      any   stock-in-trade,   consumable\r\n        stores   or   raw   materials  held   for   the\r\n        purposes of his business or profession ;\r\n\r\n                (ii) personal effects, that is to say,\r\n        movable property (including wearing apparel and\r\n        furniture, but excluding jewellery) held for\r\n        personal use by the assessee or any member of\r\n        his family dependent on him.\r\n\r\n     Depreciation.\r\n\r\n     32.

We also quote hereinbelow relevant Rules of Bombay\r\n\r\nStock Exchange Limited as they stood at the relevant time:\r\n\r\n                \"Membership a Personal Privilege\r\n\r\n         5.

Since the appellants\' land was also included in the notification, they \r\n\r\n\r\nmade a representation to the Chairman-cum-Chief Executive Officer of the \r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment   Authority   (Respondent   No.4)   with   copies   to   the   Chief \r\n\r\n\r\nMinister,   Principal   Secretary,   Housing   and   Urban   Development,   U.P.,   the \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDistrict   Magistrate   and   the   Special   Officer,   Land   Acquisition,   Gautam \r\n\r\n\r\nBuddh Nagar with the request that their land comprised   in Khasra No.394 \r\n\r\n\r\nmay not be acquired because they had raised construction 30-35 years ago \r\n\r\n\r\nand   were   using   the   property   for   abadi/habitation.   The   concerned \r\n\r\n\r\nfunctionaries/authorities did not pay heed to the request of the appellants and \r\n\r\n\r\nthe State Government issued notification dated 19.11.2008 under Section 6 \r\n\r\n\r\nread with Section 9 of the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.     The   appellants   challenged   the   acquisition   of   their   land   on   several \r\n\r\n\r\ngrounds including the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n       (i)      That the land cannot be used for industrial purposes because in \r\n\r\n\r\n       the draft Master Plan of Greater NOIDA (2021), the same is shown as \r\n\r\n\r\n       part of residential zone.  \r\n\r\n\r\n       (ii)     That they had already constructed dwelling  houses and as per \r\n\r\n\r\n       the   policy   of   the   State   Government,   the   residential   structures   are \r\n\r\n\r\n       exempted from acquisition.\r\n\r\n\r\n       (iii)    That   the   State   Government   arbitrarily   invoked   Section   17(1) \r\n\r\n\r\n       read with Section 17(4) of the Act and deprived them of their valuable \r\n\r\n\r\n       right to raise objections  under Section 5-A.\r\n\r\n\r\n       (iv)  The acquisition of land is vitiated by arbitrariness, mala fides and \r\n\r\n\r\n       violation  of  Article  14  of  the  Constitution   inasmuch  as   lands   of the \r\n\r\n\r\n       Member of Legislative  Assembly  and other influential persons were \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      left out from acquisition  despite the fact that they were not in abadi, \r\n\r\n\r\n      but   they   were   not   given   similar   treatment   despite   the   fact   that   their \r\n\r\n\r\n      land was part of abadi and they had constructed dwelling units.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6.    In support of their challenge to the invoking of Section 17(1) and (4), \r\n\r\n\r\nthe appellants made detailed averments in paragraphs 11 and 16 and raised \r\n\r\n\r\nspecific grounds A and F, which are extracted below:\r\n\r\n\r\n              \"11.   That   as   per   the   scheme   of   the   said   Act,   each   and \r\n\r\n              every  section  from sections  4  to 17  has  an independent \r\n\r\n              role   to   play   though   there   is   an   element   of   interaction \r\n\r\n              between them.  Section 5-A, has a very important role to \r\n\r\n              play in the acquisition proceedings and it is mandatory of \r\n\r\n              the part of the government to give hearing to the person \r\n\r\n              interested   in   the   land   whose   land   is   sought   to   be \r\n\r\n              acquired.    It is relevant  to point out that the acquisition \r\n\r\n              proceedings under the Act, are based on the principal of \r\n\r\n              eminent   domain   and   the   only   protection   given   to   the \r\n\r\n              person   whose   land   is   sought   to   be   acquired   is   an \r\n\r\n              opportunity under Section 5-A of the Act to convince the \r\n\r\n              enquiring authority that the purpose for which the land is \r\n\r\n              sought   to   be  acquired   is   in  fact   is   not   a  public   purpose \r\n\r\n              and is only purported to be one in the guise of a public \r\n\r\n              purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      It   is   relevant   to   mention   here   that   excluding   the \r\n\r\n              enquiry   under   Section   5-A   can   only   be   an   exception \r\n\r\n              where the urgency cannot brook any delay.  The enquiry \r\n\r\n              provides an opportunity to the owner of land to convince \r\n\r\n              the authorities concerned that the land in question is not \r\n\r\n              suitable for purpose for which it is sought to be acquired \r\n\r\n              or   the   same   sought   to   be   acquired   for   the   collateral \r\n\r\n              purposes.    It   is   pertinent   to   mention   here   that   the \r\n\r\n              respondents  No.  1  &amp;  2  without   the  application  of  mind \r\n\r\n              dispensed   with   the   enquiry   on   the   ground   of   urgency \r\n\r\n              invoking the power conferred by Section 17 (1) or (2) of \r\n\r\n              the   Act.     Further,   the   respondent   No.   1   &amp;   2   without \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplication of mind did not considered the survey report \r\n\r\nof the abadi of the village Makaura where the entire land \r\n\r\nis being used for the purpose of residence and grazing of \r\n\r\ncattle\'s in Khasra No. 394.  Further, the petitioners were \r\n\r\nsurprised to find that their land have not been included in \r\n\r\nthe   Abadi   irrespective   the   same   is   in   use   for   habitable \r\n\r\nand   keeping   the   cattle   and   other   uses.     The   petitioners \r\n\r\nhave   constructed   their   houses   and   using   the   same   for \r\n\r\ntheir   residence   and   keep   their   cattle\'s   and   agricultural \r\n\r\nproduce.    The   survey   report   clearly   shows   that   the \r\n\r\nimpugned Khasra  No. 394 is in use  for residence.    The \r\n\r\nreport in respect of the land in question falling in Khasra \r\n\r\nNo.   394   given   by   the   respondent   No.   4   vide \r\n\r\ncommunication   dated   26th  March,   2007   is   annexed   as \r\n\r\nAnnexure 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n16.     That   the   said   notification   under   Section   4   of   the \r\n\r\nAct   issued   by   the   respondent   No.   1   and   2   is   without \r\n\r\napplication   of   mind   and   there   was   no   urgency   in   the \r\n\r\nacquisition   of   land,   for   the   planned   industrial \r\n\r\ndevelopment, as the land, as per the master plan - 2021 \r\n\r\nthe   land   of   the   village   Makaura   is   reserved   for \r\n\r\n\"residential\"   of   which   the   respondent   No.   2   invoked \r\n\r\nSection 17 (1) and subsection 4 of the Act by dispensing \r\n\r\nwith an enquiry under Section 5A of the Act.   The said \r\n\r\naction   on   the   part   of   the   respondents   are   un-warranted \r\n\r\nand is in gross violation of Article 14,19, 21 and 300A of \r\n\r\nthe constitution.   The such illegal  act on the part of the \r\n\r\nrespondents show mala fide and their oblique motive to \r\n\r\ndeprive   the   owners   from  their   houses   in   order   to   fulfill \r\n\r\ntheir political obligations/promise to the private builders \r\n\r\nby   taking   the   shelter   of   section   17   of   the   Act   by \r\n\r\ndispensing with the enquiry under Section 5-A of the Act \r\n\r\nas well as overlooked purpose as stipulated in the Master \r\n\r\nPlan   2021   which   is   any   way   do   not   require   any   urgent \r\n\r\nattention. \r\n\r\n\r\nA.      That the whole acquisition proceedings   are void, \r\n\r\nunconstitutional,   tainted   with   mala   fide,   abuse   of \r\n\r\nauthority   and   power,   non-application   of   mind,   and   as \r\n\r\nsuch, liable to be quashed as violative of Articles 14,19 \r\n\r\nand 300-A of the Constitution of India. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            F.      That   the   purpose   stated   in   the   notification   under \r\n\r\n            Section   4   and   declaration   under   section   6   by   invoking \r\n\r\n            section   17   is   presently   non-existent   and   thus   the \r\n\r\n            notification   is   bad   in   law.   There   is   no   urgency   for   the \r\n\r\n            invocation   when   the   land   is   to   be   acquired   for   planned \r\n\r\n            development for the purpose of setting residential colony. \r\n\r\n            The impugned             notification   is   without   any   authority \r\n\r\n            of law and volatile of Article 300-A of the Constitution \r\n\r\n            of   India,   which   limits   the   power   to   acquire   land   to   the \r\n\r\n            authority under the Land Acquisition Act.  Therefore, the \r\n\r\n            notification in question is bad in law.\"\r\n\r\n                                                              (emphasis supplied)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7.    The  High  Court negatived  the  appellants\'   challenge  at the  threshold \r\n\r\n\r\nmainly on the ground that the averments contained in the petition were not \r\n\r\n\r\nsupported by a proper affidavit.  This is evident from the following portions \r\n\r\n\r\nof the impugned order:\r\n\r\n\r\n            \"Here the petitioners neither have pleaded that there exist \r\n\r\n            no material before  the State Government to come to the \r\n\r\n            conclusion that the enquiry under Section 5-A should be \r\n\r\n            dispensed with by invoking Section 17(4) of the Act nor \r\n\r\n            the learned counsel for the petitioners could place before \r\n\r\n            us   any   such   averment   in   the   writ   petition.   Though,   in \r\n\r\n            para-11 of the writ petition, an averment has been made \r\n\r\n            that the respondents no. 1 and 2 without the application \r\n\r\n            of   mind   dispensed   with   the   enquiry   on   the   ground   of \r\n\r\n            urgency  invoking the power conferred by Section  17(1) \r\n\r\n            or (2) of the Act, but in the affidavit, the said paragraph \r\n\r\n            has   been   sworn   on   the   basis   of   perusal   of   record. \r\n\r\n            Similarly   in   para   16   of   the   writ   petition,   the   only \r\n\r\n            averment contained therein is as under:\r\n\r\n\r\n            \"16. That the said notification under Section 4 of the \r\n\r\n            Act   issued   by   the   respondent   No.1   and   2   is   without \r\n\r\n            application of mind and there was no urgency in the \r\n\r\n            acquisition   of   land,   for   the   planned   industrial \r\n\r\n            development, as the land, as per the master plan-2021 \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               the   land   of   the   village   Makaura   is   reserved   for \r\n\r\n               \"residential\"   of   which   the   respondent   No.2   invoked \r\n\r\n               Section   17(1)   and   sub-section   4   of   the   Act   by \r\n\r\n               dispensing with an enquiry under Section 5-A of the \r\n\r\n               Act. The said action on the part of the respondents are \r\n\r\n               un-warranted   and   is   in   gross   violation   of   Article \r\n\r\n               14,19,21   and   300A   of   the   Constitution.     The   such \r\n\r\n               illegal   act   on  the   part   of  the  respondents   show   mala \r\n\r\n               fide   and   their   oblique   motive   to   deprive   the   owners \r\n\r\n               from   their   houses   in   order   to   fulfill   their   political \r\n\r\n               obligations/ promise to the private builders by taking \r\n\r\n               the shelter of Section 17 of the Act by dispensing with \r\n\r\n               the  enquiry  under Section   5-A  of the  Act as  well  as \r\n\r\n               overlooked   purpose   as   stipulated   in   the   Master   Plan \r\n\r\n               2021   which   is   any   way   do   not   require   any   urgent \r\n\r\n               attention.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n               However, in the affidavit, this para has not been sworn at \r\n\r\n               all   and   in   any   case   with   respect   to   dispensation   of \r\n\r\n               enquiry under Section 5-A by invoking  Section 17(4) of \r\n\r\n               the Act nothing has been said except that the exercise of \r\n\r\n               power is violative of Articles 14,19, 21 and 300-A of the \r\n\r\n               Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n               We, therefore, do not find any occasion even to call upon \r\n\r\n               the   respondents   to   file   a   counter   affidavit   placing   on \r\n\r\n               record,   the   material   if   any   for   exercising   power   under \r\n\r\n               Section   17(1)   and   (4)   of   the   Act   in   the   absence   of   any \r\n\r\n               relevant   pleading   or   material   and   the   question   of \r\n\r\n               requiring the respondents to produce the original record \r\n\r\n               in this regard also does not arise.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8.     The   High   Court   distinguished   the   judgment   of   this   Court   in  Om \r\n\r\n\r\nPrakash   v.   State   of   U.P.  (1998)   6   SCC   1,   albeit   without   assigning   any \r\n\r\n\r\ncogent   reason,   relied   upon   the   judgments   of   the   Division   Benches   in \r\n\r\n\r\nKshama Sahkari Avas Samiti Ltd. v. State of U.P.  2007 (1) AWC 327, \r\n\r\n\r\nJasraj Singh v. State of U.P. 2008 (8) ADJ 329 and Jagriti Sahkari Avas \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSamiti Ltd. Ghaziabad v. State of U.P. 2008 (9) ADJ 43 and held that the \r\n\r\n\r\ndecision of the Government to invoke Section 17(1) cannot be subjected to \r\n\r\n\r\njudicial   review.   The   High   Court   also   rejected   the   appellants\'   plea   that   in \r\n\r\n\r\nterms  of  the  policy  framed by  the   State   Government, the  land   covered   by \r\n\r\n\r\nabadi cannot be acquired by observing that no material has been placed on \r\n\r\n\r\nrecord   to   show   that   the   policy   framed   in   1991   was   still   continuing.     To \r\n\r\n\r\nbuttress   this   conclusion,   the   High   Court   relied   upon   the   judgment   of   this \r\n\r\n\r\nCourt in Anand Buttons Limited v. State of Haryana (2005) 9 SCC 164.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9.      By an order dated 29.10.2010, this Court, after taking cognizance of \r\n\r\n\r\nthe fact that the respondents did not get opportunity to file reply to the writ \r\n\r\n\r\npetition, directed them to do so. Thereupon, Shri Harnam Singh, Additional \r\n\r\n\r\nDistrict   Magistrate   (Land   Acquisition)/Officer   on   Special   Duty   (Land \r\n\r\n\r\nAcquisition) NOIDA, District Gautam Budh Nagar filed counter affidavit on \r\n\r\n\r\nbehalf   of   respondent   Nos.1   to   3.     In   paragraph   10   of   his   affidavit,   Shri \r\n\r\n\r\nHarnam  Singh   has   attempted   to   justify   invoking   of   the   urgency   clause   by \r\n\r\n\r\nmaking the following assertions:\r\n\r\n\r\n                \"That   in   invoking   the   urgency   clause   the   State \r\n\r\n                Government   has   taken   into   consideration   the   following \r\n\r\n                factors:-\r\n\r\n\r\n                i)      Greater   Noida   Industrial   Development   Authority \r\n\r\n                was   constituted   under   the   U.P.   Industrial   Area \r\n\r\n                Development Act, 1976 to promote Industrial and Urban \r\n\r\n                Development   in   the   Area.     The   acquired   land   was \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             urgently   required   by   the   Development   Authority   for \r\n\r\n             planned Industrial Development of the area.\r\n\r\n\r\n             ii)     That the land in the adjoining villages were already \r\n\r\n             acquired   by   the   Greater   Noida   Industrial   Development \r\n\r\n             Authority.  Thus, the acquired land was urgently required \r\n\r\n             for   continuity   of   infrastructure   services   and   planned \r\n\r\n             Industrial   Development   of   the   Area.     If,   the   proposed \r\n\r\n             land   was   not   acquired   immediately   and   delay   in   this \r\n\r\n             regard would lead to encroachments and would adversely \r\n\r\n             affect the Planned Industrial Development of the Area.\r\n\r\n\r\n             iii)    That   the   acquired   land   was   required   for   overall \r\n\r\n             development   i.e.   construction   of   roads,   laying   of \r\n\r\n             sewerages,   providing   electricity   etc.   in   the   area   and  the \r\n\r\n             said   scheme   has   been   duly   approved   by   the   state \r\n\r\n             government.\r\n\r\n\r\n             iv)     That   the   acquired   land   consists   of   246   plots \r\n\r\n             numbers with 392 recorded tenure holders.  If objections \r\n\r\n             are   to   be   invited   and   hearing   be   given   to   such   large \r\n\r\n             number   of   tenure   holders,   it   would   take   long   time   to \r\n\r\n             dispose of the objections thereof and would hamper the \r\n\r\n             planned development of the area.\r\n\r\n\r\n             v)      That   reputed   industrial   houses   who   are   interested \r\n\r\n                     in investing in the State and in case the land is not \r\n\r\n                     readily available, they might move to other states \r\n\r\n                     and   such   a   move   would   adversely   affect   the \r\n\r\n                     employment opportunities in the State.\"                  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Shri   Harnam   Singh   also   controverted   the   appellants\'   plea   for \r\n\r\n\r\nexemption by stating that the constructions made by them on land of Khasra \r\n\r\n\r\nNos.101 and 399 were insignificant  and the construction raised on Khasra \r\n\r\n\r\nNo.394 is not part of village Abadi.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10.     Shri   Manoj   Kumar   Singh,   Tehsildar   filed   a   separate   affidavit   on \r\n\r\n\r\nbehalf of Respondent No.4 and justified the invoking of urgency clause by \r\n\r\n\r\nasserting that large tracts of land were acquired for industrial development \r\n\r\n\r\nof the district.  According to him, as per the policy of industrial development \r\n\r\n\r\nof   the   State   Government,   the   land   is   required   to   be   allotted   to   industrial \r\n\r\n\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\n\r\n11.     On   8.11.2010,  Shri   Dinesh   Dwivedi  learned   senior   counsel   for   the \r\n\r\n\r\nState   made   a   request   for   permission   to   file   additional   affidavit   with   some \r\n\r\n\r\ndocuments. His request was accepted.   Thereafter, the respondents filed an \r\n\r\n\r\naffidavit   of   Shri   Sushil   Kumar   Chaubey,   Tehsildar,   Land   Acquisition, \r\n\r\n\r\nGautam Budh Nagar along with eight documents of which seven have been \r\n\r\n\r\ncollectively marked as Annexure A-1.     The first of the documents marked \r\n\r\n\r\nAnnexure A-1 is copy of letter dated 25.2.2008 sent by the Commissioner \r\n\r\n\r\nand Director, Directorate of Land Acquisition, Revenue Board, U.P. to the \r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial   Secretary,   Industrial   Development   on   the   subject   of   issuance   of \r\n\r\n\r\nnotification   under   Sections   4   and   17   of   the   Act   for   acquisition   of   lands \r\n\r\n\r\nmeasuring 205.0288 hectares of village Makora.  The second document is an \r\n\r\n\r\nundated   letter   signed   by   Deputy   Chief   Executive   Officer,   Greater   Noida, \r\n\r\n\r\nCollector,  Gautam Budh Nagar and four other  officers/officials.    The  next \r\n\r\n\r\ndocument has been  described as comments/certificate on the issues raised in \r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment Order No.5261/77-4-06-251N/06 dated 21.12.2006 with regard \r\n\r\n\r\nto   proposal   for   acquisition   of   205.0288   hectares   lands   in   village   Makora. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis   document   is   accompanied   by   seven   forms   containing   various \r\n\r\n\r\nparticulars.  The third document is communication dated 29.10.2007 sent by \r\n\r\n\r\nthe   Commissioner,   Meerut   Division,   Meerut   to   the   District   Magistrate, \r\n\r\n\r\nGautam Budh Nagar conveying  the consent  of the Divisional Land Utility \r\n\r\n\r\nCommittee  for the acquisition of   lands of five villages including Makora. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter is accompanied by minutes of the meeting of the Divisional Land \r\n\r\n\r\nUtility Committee held on 29.10.2007.  The fifth document is form No.43A-\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  The sixth document is communication dated 22.2.2008 sent by Collector, \r\n\r\n\r\nLand Acquisition/Special Land Acquisition Officer, Greater Noida.  The last \r\n\r\n\r\ndocument which forms part of Annexure A-1 is form No.16 showing the list \r\n\r\n\r\nof properties having constructions etc.  Annexure A-2 is copy of letter dated \r\n\r\n\r\n31.10.2008   sent   by   the   Director,   Directorate   of   Land   Acquisition   to   the \r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial Secretary, Industrial Development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12.     Shri   N.P.Singh,   learned   counsel   for   the   appellants   argued   that   the \r\n\r\n\r\nimpugned   order   is   liable   to   be   set   aside   because   the   High   Court   failed   to \r\n\r\n\r\nconsider   the   issues   raised   in   the   writ   petition   in   a   correct   perspective. \r\n\r\n\r\nLearned counsel submitted that the appellants had specifically pleaded that \r\n\r\n\r\nthere was no valid ground to invoke the urgency clause contained in Section \r\n\r\n\r\n17(1) and to dispense with the application of Section 5-A but the High Court \r\n\r\n\r\ndid not even call upon the respondents to file counter affidavit and brushed \r\n\r\n\r\naside   the   challenge   to   the   acquisition   proceeding   on   a   wholly   untenable \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npremise  that  the  affidavit filed in support of the writ  petition was laconic. \r\n\r\n\r\nLearned counsel further argued that the purpose for which land was acquired \r\n\r\n\r\ni.e. planned industrial development of the district did not justify invoking of \r\n\r\n\r\nthe urgency provisions and denial of opportunity to the appellants and other \r\n\r\n\r\nland owners to file objections under Section 5-A (1) and to be heard by the \r\n\r\n\r\nCollector   in   terms   of   the   mandate   of   Section   5-A   (2).   In   support   of   his \r\n\r\n\r\nargument,  learned  counsel   relied   upon  the   judgments  in  Narayan   Govind \r\n\r\n\r\nGavate v. State of Maharashtra (1977) 1 SCC 133 and Esso Fabs Private \r\n\r\n\r\nLimited v. State of Haryana  (2009) 2 SCC 377. Another argument of the \r\n\r\n\r\nlearned   counsel   is   that   the   High   Court   misdirected   itself   in   summarily \r\n\r\n\r\ndismissing the writ petition ignoring the substantive plea of discrimination \r\n\r\n\r\nraised by the appellants. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13.     Shri   Dinesh   Dwivedi,   learned   senior   counsel   appearing   for   the \r\n\r\n\r\nrespondents urged that this Court should   not nullify the acquisition at the \r\n\r\n\r\ninstance of the appellants because the pleadings filed before the High Court \r\n\r\n\r\nwere not supported by proper affidavit. Shri Dwivedi argued that the High \r\n\r\n\r\nCourt   was   justified   in   non-suiting   the   appellants   because   they   did   not \r\n\r\n\r\nproduce   any   evidence   to   effectively   challenge   the   invoking   of   urgency \r\n\r\n\r\nprovision   contained   in   Section   17(1).   Learned   senior   counsel   emphasized \r\n\r\n\r\nthat the satisfaction envisaged in Section 17(1) is purely subjective and the \r\n\r\n\r\nCourt cannot review the decision taken by the State Government to invoke \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   urgency   clause.   He   submitted   that   planned   industrial   development   of \r\n\r\n\r\nDistrict   Gautam   Budh   Nagar   is   being   undertaken   in   consonance   with   the \r\n\r\n\r\npolicy decision taken by the State Government and the appellants cannot be \r\n\r\n\r\nheard to make a grievance against the acquisition of their land because they \r\n\r\n\r\nwill be duly compensated. In support of his argument, Shri Dwivedi relied \r\n\r\n\r\nupon the judgment of this Court in State of U.P. v. Pista Devi (1986) 4 SCC \r\n\r\n\r\n251 and Chameli Singh v. State of U.P. (1996) 2 SCC 549.  Learned senior \r\n\r\n\r\ncounsel further submitted that the appellants\' land cannot be released from \r\n\r\n\r\nacquisition   because   that   will   result   in   frustrating   the   objective   of   planned \r\n\r\n\r\nindustrial   development  of  the  district.   On the  issue of discrimination,  Shri \r\n\r\n\r\nDwivedi argued that even  if the land belonging to some persons has been \r\n\r\n\r\nillegally   left   out   from   acquisition,   the   appellants   are   not   entitled   to   a \r\n\r\n\r\ndirection that their land should also be released.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14.     The first issue which needs to be addressed is whether the High Court \r\n\r\n\r\nwas justified in non-suiting  the appellants on the ground that they had not \r\n\r\n\r\nraised a specific plea supported by a proper affidavit to question the decision \r\n\r\n\r\ntaken by the State Government to invoke Section 17(1) and 17(4) of the Act. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall also consider an ancillary issue   as to whether the appellants had \r\n\r\n\r\nsucceeded   in prima facie proving   that there was no justification to invoke \r\n\r\n\r\nthe urgency clause and to dispense with the inquiry envisaged under Section \r\n\r\n\r\n5-A.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15.           At   the   outset,   we   record   our   disapproval   of   the   casual   manner   in \r\n\r\n\r\nwhich the High Court disposed of the writ petition without even calling upon \r\n\r\n\r\nthe respondents to file counter affidavit and produce the relevant records. A \r\n\r\n\r\nreading of the averments contained in paragraphs 11 and 16 and grounds A \r\n\r\n\r\nand F of the writ petition, which have been extracted hereinabove   coupled \r\n\r\n\r\nwith the appellants\' assertion that the acquisition of their land was vitiated \r\n\r\n\r\ndue to discrimination inasmuch as  land belonging to influential persons had \r\n\r\n\r\nbeen left out from acquisition, but their land was acquired in total disregard \r\n\r\n\r\nof the policy of the State Government to leave out  land on which dwelling \r\n\r\n\r\nunits had already been constructed, show that they had succeeded in making \r\n\r\n\r\nout   a   strong   case   for   deeper   examination   of   the   issues   raised   in   the   writ \r\n\r\n\r\npetition     and   the  High   Court    committed   serious   error   by   summarily   non-\r\n\r\n\r\nsuiting them. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16.     The history of land acquisition legislations shows that in Eighteenth \r\n\r\n\r\nCentury, Bengal Regulation I of 1824, Act I of 1850, Act VI of 1857, Act \r\n\r\n\r\nXXII of 1863, Act X of 1870, Bombay Act No. XXVIII of 1839, Bombay \r\n\r\n\r\nAct No. XVII of 1850, Madras Act No. XX of 1852 and Madras Act No.1 of \r\n\r\n\r\n1854 were enacted to facilitate the acquisition of land and other immovable \r\n\r\n\r\nproperties for roads, canals, and other public purposes by paying the amount \r\n\r\n\r\nto be determined by the arbitrators.  In 1870, the Land Acquisition Act was \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenacted   to   provide   for   proper   valuation   of   the   acquired   land.     That   Act \r\n\r\n\r\nenvisaged that if the person having interest in   land is not agreeable to part \r\n\r\n\r\nwith possession by accepting the amount offered to him, then the Collector \r\n\r\n\r\nmay   make   a   reference   to   the   Civil   Court.   The   1870   Act   also   envisaged \r\n\r\n\r\nappointment   of   assessors   to   assist   the   Civil   Court.     If   the   Court   and   the \r\n\r\n\r\nassessor   did not  agree  on  the amount  then an  appeal  could be  filed  in  the \r\n\r\n\r\nHigh   Court.     This   mechanism   proved   ineffective   because   lot   of   time   was \r\n\r\n\r\nconsumed   in   litigation.     With   a   view   to   overcome   this   problem,   the \r\n\r\n\r\nlegislature   enacted   the   Act   on   the   line   of   the   English   Lands   Clauses \r\n\r\n\r\nConsolidation   Act,   1845.     However,   the   land   owners   or   persons   having \r\n\r\n\r\ninterest in land did not have any say in the acquisition process either under \r\n\r\n\r\npre-1984   legislations   or   the   1984   Act   (un-amended).   They   could   raise \r\n\r\n\r\nobjection   only   qua   the   amount   of   compensation   and   matters   connected \r\n\r\n\r\ntherewith.     The   absence   of   opportunity   to   raise   objection   against   the \r\n\r\n\r\nacquisition of land was resented by those who were deprived of their land. \r\n\r\n\r\nTo redress this grievance, Section 5A was inserted in the Act by amending \r\n\r\n\r\nAct No.38 of 1923.  The statement of Objects and Reasons contained in Bill \r\n\r\n\r\nNo.29 of 1923, which led to enactment of the amending Act read as under:\r\n\r\n\r\n                \"The   Land   Acquisition   Act   I   of   1894   does   not   provide \r\n\r\n                that   persons   having   an   interest   in   land   which   it   is \r\n\r\n                proposed to acquire, shall have the right of objecting to \r\n\r\n                such   acquisition;   nor   is   Government   bound   to   enquire \r\n\r\n                into   and   consider   any   objections   that   may   reach   them. \r\n\r\n                The   object   of   this   Bill   is   to   provide   that   a   Local \r\n\r\n                Government shall not declare, under Section 6 of the Act, \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            that any land is needed for a public purpose unless time \r\n\r\n            has   been   allowed   after   the   notification   under   Section   4 \r\n\r\n            for persons interested in the land to put in objections and \r\n\r\n            for   such   objections   to   be   considered   by   the   Local \r\n\r\n            Government.\"   \r\n\r\n\r\n17.             The   Act,   which   was   enacted   more   than   116   years   ago   for \r\n\r\n\r\nfacilitating   the   acquisition   of   land   and   other   immovable   properties   for \r\n\r\n\r\nconstruction of roads, canals, railways etc., has been frequently used in \r\n\r\n\r\nthe   post   independence   era   for   different   public   purposes   like   laying   of \r\n\r\n\r\nroads,     construction   of   bridges,   dams   and   buildings   of   various   public \r\n\r\n\r\nestablishments/institutions,   planned   development   of   urban   areas, \r\n\r\n\r\nproviding   of   houses   to   different   sections   of   the   society   and   for \r\n\r\n\r\ndeveloping residential colonies/sectors.  However, in the recent years, the \r\n\r\n\r\ncountry has witnessed a new phenomena.  Large tracts of land have been \r\n\r\n\r\nacquired in   rural parts of the country in the name of development and \r\n\r\n\r\ntransferred   to   private   entrepreneurs,   who   have   utilized   the   same   for \r\n\r\n\r\nconstruction   of   multi-storied   complexes,   commercial   centers   and   for \r\n\r\n\r\nsetting up industrial units.   Similarly, large scale acquisitions have been \r\n\r\n\r\nmade on behalf of the companies by invoking the provisions contained in \r\n\r\n\r\nPart VII of the Act. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18.       The resultant effect of these acquisitions is that the land owners, \r\n\r\n\r\nwho  were doing  agricultural   operations  and  other  ancillary   activities   in \r\n\r\n\r\nrural   areas,   have   been   deprived   of   the   only   source   of   their   livelihood. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMajority of them do not have any idea about their constitutional and legal \r\n\r\n\r\nrights,   which   can   be   enforced   by   availing   the   constitutional   remedies \r\n\r\n\r\nunder   Articles   32   and   226   of   the   Constitution.     They   reconcile   with \r\n\r\n\r\ndeprivation of land by accepting the amount of compensation offered by \r\n\r\n\r\nthe   Government   and   by   thinking   that   it   is   their   fate   and   destiny \r\n\r\n\r\ndetermined   by   God.     Even   those   who   get   semblance   of   education   are \r\n\r\n\r\nneither   conversant   with   the   functioning   of  the  State   apparatus   nor   they \r\n\r\n\r\ncan access the records prepared by the concerned authorities as a prelude \r\n\r\n\r\nto the acquisition of   land by invoking Section 4 with or without the aid \r\n\r\n\r\nof   Section   17(1)   and/or   17(4).       Therefore,   while   examining   the   land \r\n\r\n\r\nowner\'s   challenge   to   the   acquisition   of   land   in   a   petition   filed   under \r\n\r\n\r\nArticle   226   of   the   Constitution,     the   High   Court   should   not   adopt   a \r\n\r\n\r\npedantic approach, as has been done in the present case, and decide the \r\n\r\n\r\nmatter  keeping  in  view the  constitutional   goals  of  social  and  economic \r\n\r\n\r\njustice and the fact that even though the right to property is no longer a \r\n\r\n\r\nfundamental right, the same continues to be an important constitutional \r\n\r\n\r\nright   and   in   terms   of   Article   300-A,   no   person   can   be   deprived   of   his \r\n\r\n\r\nproperty   except   by   authority   of   law.     In   cases   where   the   acquisition   is \r\n\r\n\r\nmade   by   invoking   Section   4   read   with   Section   17(1)   and/or   17(4),   the \r\n\r\n\r\nHigh Court should insist upon filing of reply affidavit by the respondents \r\n\r\n\r\nand production of the relevant records and carefully scrutinize the same \r\n\r\n\r\nbefore   pronouncing   upon   legality   of   the   impugned   notification/action \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause a negative result without examining the relevant records to find \r\n\r\n\r\nout whether the competent authority had formed a bona fide opinion on \r\n\r\n\r\nthe issue of invoking the urgency provision and excluding the application \r\n\r\n\r\nof Section 5-A is likely to make the land owner a landless poor and force \r\n\r\n\r\nhim to migrate to the nearby city only to live in a slum.  A departure from \r\n\r\n\r\nthis   rule   should   be   made   only   when   land   is   required   to   meet   really \r\n\r\n\r\nemergent   situations   like   those   enumerated   in   Section   17(2).     If   the \r\n\r\n\r\nacquisition   is   intended   to   benefit   private   person(s)   and   the   provisions \r\n\r\n\r\ncontained in Section 17(1) and/or 17(4) are invoked, then scrutiny of the \r\n\r\n\r\njustification   put forward  by  the  State  should  be  more  rigorous  in cases \r\n\r\n\r\ninvolving the challenge to the acquisition of land, the pleadings should be \r\n\r\n\r\nliberally   construed   and   relief   should   not   be   denied   to   the   petitioner   by \r\n\r\n\r\napplying the technical rules of procedure embodied in the Code of Civil \r\n\r\n\r\nProcedure and other procedural laws. In this context it will be profitable \r\n\r\n\r\nto   notice   the   observations   made   by   this   Court   in  Authorised   Officer, \r\n\r\n\r\nThanjavur   v.   S   Naganatha   Ayyar  (1979)   3   SCC   466,   which   are     as \r\n\r\n\r\nunder:\r\n\r\n\r\n            \"It is true that Judges are constitutional invigilators \r\n\r\n            and   statutory   interpreters;   but   they   are   also   responsive \r\n\r\n            and responsible to Part IV of the Constitution being one \r\n\r\n            of  the   trinity   of  the  nation\'s   appointed   instrumentalities \r\n\r\n            in   the   transformation   of   the   socio-economic   order.   The \r\n\r\n            judiciary, in its sphere, shares the revolutionary purpose \r\n\r\n            of   the   constitutional   order,   and   when   called   upon   to \r\n\r\n            decode   social   legislation   must   be   animated   by   a   goal-\r\n\r\n            oriented   approach.   This   is   part   of   the   dynamics   of \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                statutory   interpretation   in   the   developing   countries   so \r\n\r\n                that courts are not converted into rescue shelters for those \r\n\r\n                who  seek  to  defeat  agrarian  justice  by  cute  transactions \r\n\r\n                of   many   manifestations   now   so   familiar   in   the   country \r\n\r\n                and   illustrated   by   the   several   cases   under   appeal.   This \r\n\r\n                caveat has become necessary because the judiciary is not \r\n\r\n                a mere umpire, as some assume, but an activist catalyst in \r\n\r\n                the constitutional scheme.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19.     We may now advert to the ancillary question whether the High Court \r\n\r\n\r\nwas justified in non suiting the appellants on the ground that they failed to \r\n\r\n\r\ndischarge   the   primary   burden   of   proving   that   the   State   Government   had \r\n\r\n\r\ninvoked Section 17(1) and 17(4) without application of mind to the relevant \r\n\r\n\r\nconsiderations.   In this context, it is apposite to observe that while dealing \r\n\r\n\r\nwith challenge to the acquisition  of land belonging to those who suffer from \r\n\r\n\r\nhandicaps of poverty, illiteracy and ignorance and do not have the resources \r\n\r\n\r\nto access the material relied upon by the functionaries of the   State and its \r\n\r\n\r\nagencies for forming an opinion or recording a satisfaction that the urgency \r\n\r\n\r\nprovisions   contained   in   Section   17(1)   should   be   resorted   to   and/or   the \r\n\r\n\r\nenquiry   envisaged   under   Section   5A   should     be   dispensed   with,   the   High \r\n\r\n\r\nCourt   should   not   literally   apply   the   abstract   rules   of   burden   of   proof \r\n\r\n\r\nenshrined   in   the   Evidence   Act.     It   is   too   much   to   expect   from   the   rustic \r\n\r\n\r\nvillagers, who are not conversant with the intricacies of law and functioning \r\n\r\n\r\nof the judicial system in our country to first obtain relevant information and \r\n\r\n\r\nrecords   from   the   concerned   State   authorities   and   then   present   skillfully \r\n\r\n\r\ndrafted petition for enforcement of his legal and/or constitutional rights. The \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCourt should also bear in mind that the relevant records are always  in the \r\n\r\n\r\nexclusive   possession/domain   of   the   authorities   of   the   State   and/or   its \r\n\r\n\r\nagencies.     Therefore,   an   assertion   by   the   appellants   that   there   was   no \r\n\r\n\r\nurgency   in   the   acquisition   of   land;   that   the   concerned   authorities   did   not \r\n\r\n\r\napply  mind  to  the  relevant  factors  and  records  and  arbitrarily  invoked  the \r\n\r\n\r\nurgency   provisions   and   thereby   denied   him   the   minimum   opportunity   of \r\n\r\n\r\nhearing in terms of Section 5-A(1) and (2), should be treated as sufficient \r\n\r\n\r\nfor   calling   upon   the   respondents   to   file   their   response   and   produce   the \r\n\r\n\r\nrelevant records to justify the invoking of urgency provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n20.     In  Narayan   Govind   Gavate   v.   State   of   Maharashtra  (supra),   the \r\n\r\n\r\nthree-Judge Bench of this Court examined the correctness of the judgment \r\n\r\n\r\nof   the   Bombay   High   Court   whereby   the   acquisition   of   land   by   the   State \r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment by issuing notification under Section 4 read with Section 17(1) \r\n\r\n\r\nand 17(4) for development and utilisation as residential and industrial area \r\n\r\n\r\nwas  quashed.   The   High Court held  that  the  purpose  of  acquisition  was a \r\n\r\n\r\ngenuine public purpose but quashed the notifications by observing that the \r\n\r\n\r\nburden   of   proving   the   existence   of   circumstances   which   could   justify \r\n\r\n\r\ninvoking   of   urgency   clause   was   on   the   State,   which   it   had   failed   to \r\n\r\n\r\ndischarge. Some of the observations made by the High Court, which have \r\n\r\n\r\nbeen extracted in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the judgment of this Court, are \r\n\r\n\r\nreproduced below.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When the formation of an opinion or the satisfaction of \r\n\r\nan authority is subjective but is a condition precedent to \r\n\r\nthe exercise of a power, the challenge to the formation of \r\n\r\nsuch opinion or to such satisfaction is limited, in law, to \r\n\r\nthree   points   only.   It   can   be   challenged,   firstly,   on   the \r\n\r\nground   of   mala   fides;   secondly,   on   the   ground   that   the \r\n\r\nauthority which formed that opinion or which arrived at \r\n\r\nsuch satisfaction did not apply its mind to the material on \r\n\r\nwhich it formed the opinion or arrived at the satisfaction, \r\n\r\nand,   thirdly,   that   the   material   on   which   it   formed   its \r\n\r\nopinion   or   reached   the   satisfaction   was   so   insufficient \r\n\r\nthat no man  could reasonably  reach that conclusion.  So \r\n\r\nfar as the third point is concerned, no court of law can, as \r\n\r\nin an appeal, consider that, on the material placed before \r\n\r\nthe   authority,   the   authority   was   justified   in   reaching   its \r\n\r\nconclusion.   The   court   can   interfere   only   in   such   cases \r\n\r\nwhere there was no material at all or the material was so \r\n\r\ninsufficient   that   no   man   could   have   reasonably   reached \r\n\r\nthat conclusion. \r\n\r\nIn   the   case   before   us   the   petitioner   has   stated   in   the \r\n\r\npetition more than once that the urgency clause had been \r\n\r\napplied without any valid reason. The urgency clause in \r\n\r\nrespect of each of the said two notifications  concerning \r\n\r\nthe lands in Groups 1 and 2 is contained in the relative \r\n\r\nSection 4 notification itself. The public purpose stated in \r\n\r\nthe notification is `for development and utilization of the \r\n\r\nsaid lands as an industrial and residential area\'. To start \r\n\r\nwith, this statement itself is vague, in the sense that it is \r\n\r\nnot clear whether the development and utilization of the \r\n\r\nlands   referred   to   in   that   statement   was   confined   to   the \r\n\r\nlands mentioned in the schedule to the notification or it \r\n\r\napplied to a wider area of which such lands formed only \r\n\r\na   part.   So   far   as   the   affidavit   in   reply   is   concerned,   no \r\n\r\nfacts   whatever   are   stated.   The   affidavit   only   states   that \r\n\r\nthe   authority   i.e.   the   Commissioner   of   the   Bombay \r\n\r\nDivision   was   satisfied   that   the   possession   of   the   said \r\n\r\nlands  was  urgently   required   for the  purpose   of  carrying \r\n\r\nout   the   said   development.   Even   Mr   Setalvad   conceded \r\n\r\nthat the affidavit does not contain a statement of facts on \r\n\r\nwhich the authority was satisfied or on which it formed \r\n\r\nits   opinion.  It   is,   therefore,   quite   clear   that   the \r\n\r\nrespondents  have failed  to bring on record any material \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                whatever   on   which   the   respondents   formed   the   opinion \r\n\r\n                mentioned   in   the   two   notifications.  The   notifications \r\n\r\n                themselves show that they concern many lands other than \r\n\r\n                those   falling   in   the   said   first   and   third   groups.   It   is   not \r\n\r\n                possible   to   know   what   was   the   development   for   which \r\n\r\n                the lands were being acquired, much less is it possible to \r\n\r\n                know   what   were   the   circumstances   which   caused \r\n\r\n                urgency   in   the   taking   of   possession   of   such   lands.  We \r\n\r\n                have held that the burden of proving such circumstances, \r\n\r\n                at   least   prima   facie   is   on   the   respondents.   As   the \r\n\r\n                respondents   have   brought   no   relevant   material   on   the \r\n\r\n                record,   the   respondents   have   failed   to   discharge   that \r\n\r\n                burden.  We   must,   in   conclusion,   hold   that   the   urgency \r\n\r\n                provision   under   Section   17(4)   was   not   validly   resorted \r\n\r\n                to.\"\r\n\r\n                                                                     (emphasis supplied)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        While   dealing   with   the   argument   of   the   State   that   it   was   for   the \r\n\r\n\r\npetitioner   to   prove   that   there   was   no   material   to   justify   invoking   of   the \r\n\r\n\r\nurgency clause, this Court observed:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"We do not think that a question relating to burden of proof is \r\n\r\n        always free from difficulty or is quite so simple as it is sought \r\n\r\n        to   be   made   out   here.   Indeed,   the   apparent   simplicity   of   a \r\n\r\n        question relating to presumptions and burdens of proof, which \r\n\r\n        have   to   be   always   viewed   together   is   often   deceptive.   Over \r\n\r\n        simplification  of  such  questions  leads  to  erroneous  statements \r\n\r\n        and misapplications of the law.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        The Court then referred to the judgment in Woolmington v. Director \r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Prosecutions,  1935 AC 462, extensively quoted from     Phipson on \r\n\r\n\r\nEvidence (11th Edn),  noticed Sections 101 to 106 of the Evidence Act and \r\n\r\n\r\nobserved:\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Coming   back   to   the   cases   before   us,   we   find   that   the \r\n\r\nHigh   Court   had   correctly   stated   the   grounds   on   which \r\n\r\neven a subjective opinion as to the existence of the need \r\n\r\nto   take   action   under   Section   17(4)   of   the   Act   can   be \r\n\r\nchallenged on certain limited grounds. But, as soon as we \r\n\r\nspeak of a challenge we have to bear in mind the general \r\n\r\nburdens   laid   down   by   Sections   101   and   102   of   the \r\n\r\nEvidence  Act.  It   is  for  the   petitioner  to  substantiate  the \r\n\r\ngrounds of his challenge. This means  that the petitioner \r\n\r\nhas  to either  lead evidence or show  that some  evidence \r\n\r\nhas come from the side of the respondents to indicate that \r\n\r\nhis challenge to a notification or order is made good. If \r\n\r\nhe does not succeed in discharging that duty his petition \r\n\r\nwill fail. But, is that the position in the cases before us? \r\n\r\nWe   find   that,   although   the   High   Court   had   stated   the \r\n\r\nquestion before it to be one which \"narrows down to the \r\n\r\npoint as to the burden of proof\" yet, it had analysed the \r\n\r\nevidence   sufficiently   before   it   to   reach   the   conclusion \r\n\r\nthat   the   urgency   provision   under   Section   17(4)   had   not \r\n\r\nbeen validly resorted to.\r\n\r\n                                              \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n We think that the original or stable onus laid down by \r\n\r\nSection 101 and Section 102 of the Evidence Act cannot \r\n\r\nbe shifted by the use of Section 106 of the Evidence Act, \r\n\r\nalthough   the   particular   onus   of   providing   facts   and \r\n\r\ncircumstances   lying   especially   within   the   knowledge   of \r\n\r\nthe official who formed the opinion which resulted in the \r\n\r\nnotification   under   Section   17   (4)   of   the   Act   rests   upon \r\n\r\nthat   official.   The   recital,   if   it   is   not   defective,   may \r\n\r\nobviate   the   need   to   look   further.   But,   there   may   be \r\n\r\ncircumstances in the case which impel the court to look \r\n\r\nbeyond it. And, at that stage, Section 106 Evidence Act \r\n\r\ncan   be   invoked   by   the   party   assailing   an   order   or \r\n\r\nnotification.   It   is   most   unsafe   in   such   cases   for   the \r\n\r\nofficial or authority concerned to rest content which non-\r\n\r\ndisclosure of facts especially within his or its knowledge \r\n\r\nby relying on the sufficiency of a recital. Such an attitude \r\n\r\nmay itself justify further judicial scrutiny.\r\n\r\n                                              \r\n\r\nIn   the   cases   before   us,   if   the   total   evidence   from \r\n\r\nwhichever side any of it may have come, was insufficient \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            to   enable   the   petitioners   to   discharge   their   general   or \r\n\r\n            stable   onus,   their   petitions   could   not   succeed.   On   the \r\n\r\n            other hand, if, in addition to the bare assertions made by \r\n\r\n            the petitioners, that the urgency contemplated by Section \r\n\r\n            17(4)   did   not   exist,   there   were   other   facts   and \r\n\r\n            circumstances,   including   the   failure   of   the   State   to \r\n\r\n            indicate   facts   and   circumstances   which   it   could   have \r\n\r\n            easily  disclosed  if  they  existed, the petitioners  could be \r\n\r\n            held to have discharged their general onus.\r\n\r\n                                                            \r\n\r\n            It is also clear that, even a technically correct recital in an \r\n\r\n            order or notification stating that the conditions precedent \r\n\r\n            to   the   exercise   of   a   power   have   been   fulfilled   may   not \r\n\r\n            debar   the   court   in   a   given   case   from   considering   the \r\n\r\n            question   whether,   in   fact,   those   conditions   have   been \r\n\r\n            fulfilled.     And,   a   fortiori,   the   court   may   consider   and \r\n\r\n            decide   whether   the   authority   concerned   has   applied   its \r\n\r\n            mind   to   really   relevant   facts   of   a   case   with   a   view   to \r\n\r\n            determining that a condition precedent to the exercise of \r\n\r\n            a   power   has   been   fulfilled.     If   it   appears,   upon   an \r\n\r\n            examination  of  the  totality   of facts   in  the  case,   that  the \r\n\r\n            power conferred has been exercised for an extraneous or \r\n\r\n            irrelevant purpose or that the mind has not been applied \r\n\r\n            at all to the real object or purpose of a power, so that the \r\n\r\n            result is that the exercise of power could only serve some \r\n\r\n            other or collateral object, the court will interfere.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court finally held as under:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            \"There is no indication whatsoever in the \r\n\r\n            affidavit   filed   on   behalf   of   the   State   the   mind   of   the \r\n\r\n            Commissioner was applied at all to the question whether \r\n\r\n            it was a case necessitating the elimination of the enquiry \r\n\r\n            under   Section5A   of   the   Act.   The   recitals   in   the \r\n\r\n            notifications, on the other hand, indicate that elimination \r\n\r\n            of the enquiry under Section 5A of the Act was treated as \r\n\r\n            an automatic consequence of the opinion formed on other \r\n\r\n            matters.  The  recital does not say  at all that any opinion \r\n\r\n            was   formed   on   the   need   to   dispense   with   the   enquiry \r\n\r\n            under   Section   5A   of   the   Act.   It   is   certainly   a   case   in \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               which   the   recital   was   at   least   defective.   The   burden, \r\n\r\n               therefore, rested upon the State to remove the defect, if \r\n\r\n               possible,   by   evidence   to   show   that   some   exceptional \r\n\r\n               circumstances   which   necessitated   the   elimination   of   an \r\n\r\n               enquiry under Section 5A of the Act and that the mind of \r\n\r\n               the Commissioner was applied to this essential question. \r\n\r\n               It seems to us that the High Court correctly   applied the \r\n\r\n               provisions   of  Section   106  of  the   Evidence   Act   to  place \r\n\r\n               the   burden   upon   the   State     to   prove   those   special \r\n\r\n               circumstances,   although   it   also   appears   to   us   that   the \r\n\r\n               High Court was quite correct in stating its view in such a \r\n\r\n               manner as to make it appear that some part of the initial \r\n\r\n               burden of the petitioners  under Sections 101 and 102 of \r\n\r\n               the Evidence Act had been displaced by the failure of the \r\n\r\n               State to discharge  its duty under Section 106 of the Act. \r\n\r\n               The correct way of putting it would have been to say that \r\n\r\n               the failure of the State  to produce the evidence of facts \r\n\r\n               especially   within   the   knowledge   of   its   officials,   which \r\n\r\n               rested   upon   it   under   Section   106   of   the   Evidence   Act, \r\n\r\n               taken together with the attendant facts and circumstances \r\n\r\n               including   the   contents   of   recitals,   had   enabled   the \r\n\r\n               petitioners to discharge  their burden under Sections 101 \r\n\r\n               and 102 of the Evidence Act.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                              (emphasis supplied)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21.     The ratio of the aforesaid judgment was recently followed by the two-\r\n\r\n\r\nJudge  Bench   in  Anand  Singh  v. State  of Uttar  Pradesh  (2010)  11 SCC \r\n\r\n\r\n242.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n22.     We   shall   now   consider   whether   there   was   any   valid   ground   or \r\n\r\n\r\njustification for invoking the urgency provision contained in Section 17(1) \r\n\r\n\r\nand to exclude the application of Section 5A for the acquisition of land for \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplanned   industrial   development   of   the   district.

Special powers in case of urgency. - (1) In cases of \r\n\r\nurgency   whenever   the   appropriate   Government,   so \r\n\r\ndirects,   the   Collector,   though   no   such   award   has   been \r\n\r\nmade,   may,   on   the   expiration   of   fifteen   days   from   the \r\n\r\npublication   of   the   notice   mentioned   in   section   9,   sub-\r\n\r\nsection   (1)   take   possession   of   any   land   needed   for   a \r\n\r\npublic purpose. Such land shall thereupon vest absolutely \r\n\r\nin the Government, free from all encumbrances.\r\n\r\n\r\n(2)   Whenever,   owing   to   any   sudden   change   in   the \r\n\r\nchannel   of   any   navigable   river   or   other   unforeseen \r\n\r\nemergency,   it   becomes   necessary   for   any   Railway \r\n\r\nAdministration   to   acquire   the   immediate   possession   of \r\n\r\nany   land   for   the   maintenance   of   their   traffic   or   for   the \r\n\r\npurpose of making thereon a river-side or ghat station, or \r\n\r\nof providing convenient connection with or access to any \r\n\r\nsuch station, or the appropriate Government considers it \r\n\r\nnecessary   to   acquire   the   immediate   possession   of   any \r\n\r\nland   for   the   purpose   of   maintaining   any   structure   or \r\n\r\nsystem   pertaining   to   irrigation,   water   supply,   drainage, \r\n\r\nroad   communication   or   electricity,   the   Collector   may, \r\n\r\nimmediately after the publication of the notice mentioned \r\n\r\nin sub-section (1) and with the previous sanction  of the \r\n\r\nappropriate Government, enter upon and take possession \r\n\r\nof such land, which shall thereupon vest absolutely in the \r\n\r\nGovernment free from all encumbrances:\r\n\r\n\r\nProvided   that   the  Collector   shall   not  take   possession   of \r\n\r\nany building or part of a building under this sub-section \r\n\r\nwithout giving to the occupier thereof at least forty-eight \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhours\'   notice   of   his   intention   so   to   do,   or   such   longer \r\n\r\nnotice   as   may   be   reasonably   sufficient   to   enable   such \r\n\r\noccupier   to   remove   his   movable   property   from   such \r\n\r\nbuilding   without   unnecessary   inconvenience.                          \r\n\r\n\r\n(3)   In   every   case   under   either   of   the   preceding   sub-\r\n\r\nsections   the   Collector   shall   at   that   time   of   taking \r\n\r\npossession   offer   to   the   persons   interested   compensation \r\n\r\nfor the standing crops and trees (if any) on such land and \r\n\r\nfrom any other damage sustained by them caused by such \r\n\r\nsudden   dispossession   and   not   excepted   in   section   24; \r\n\r\nand, in case such offer is not accepted, the value of such \r\n\r\ncrops   and   trees   and   the   amount   of   such   other   damage \r\n\r\nshall   be   allowed   for   in   awarding   compensation   for   the \r\n\r\nland under the provisions herein contained. \r\n\r\n\r\n(3A)   Before   taking   possession   of   any   land   under   sub-\r\n\r\nsection (1) or sub-section (2), the Collector shall, without \r\n\r\nprejudice to the provisions of sub-section (3)-\r\n\r\n\r\n(a)     tender   payment   of   eighty   per   centum   of   the \r\n\r\ncompensation   for   such   land   as   estimated   by   him   to   the \r\n\r\npersons interested entitled thereto, and \r\n\r\n\r\n(b)     pay   it   to   them,   unless   prevented   by   some   one   or \r\n\r\nmore of the contingencies mentioned in section 31, sub-\r\n\r\nsection (2), \r\n\r\n\r\nand where the Collector is so prevented, the provisions of \r\n\r\nsection   31,   sub-section   (2),   (except   the   second   proviso \r\n\r\nthereto),   shall   apply   as   they   apply   to   the   payment   of \r\n\r\ncompensation under that section. \r\n\r\n\r\n(3B)   The   amount   paid   or   deposited   under   sub-section \r\n\r\n(3A),   shall   be   taken   into   account   for   determining   the \r\n\r\namount   of   compensation   required   to   be   tendered   under \r\n\r\nsection   31,   and   where   the   amount   so   paid   or   deposited \r\n\r\nexceeds   the   compensation   awarded   by   the   Collector \r\n\r\nunder section 11, the excess may, unless refunded within \r\n\r\nthree   months   from   the   date   of   Collector\'s   award,   be \r\n\r\nrecovered as an arrear of land revenue. \r\n\r\n\r\n(4) In the case of any land to which, in the opinion of the \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                appropriate   Government,   the   provisions   of   sub-section \r\n\r\n                (1)   or   sub-section   (2)   are   applicable,   the   appropriate \r\n\r\n                Government may direct that the provisions of section 5A \r\n\r\n                shall not apply, and, if it does so direct, a declaration may \r\n\r\n                be made under section 6 in respect of the land at any time \r\n\r\n                after the date of the publication of the notification under \r\n\r\n                section 4, sub-section (1).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        Section   17   has   been   amended   five   times   by   the   Uttar   Pradesh \r\n\r\n\r\nlegislature.     However,  the   only   amendment   which   is  relevant   for   deciding \r\n\r\n\r\nthis case is the insertion of proviso to Section 17(4) vide Uttar Pradesh Act \r\n\r\n\r\nNo.8 of 1974.  That proviso reads as under:\r\n\r\n\r\n                \"Provided that where in the case of any land, notification \r\n\r\n                under section 4, sub-section (1) has been published in the \r\n\r\n                Official   Gazette   on   or   after   September   24,   1984   but \r\n\r\n                before   January   11,   1989,   and   the   appropriate \r\n\r\n                Government has under this sub-section directed that the \r\n\r\n                provisions   of   section   5A   shall   not   apply,   a   declaration \r\n\r\n                under section 6 in respect of the land may be made either \r\n\r\n                simultaneously with, or at any time after, the publication \r\n\r\n                in the Official Gazette of the notification under section 4, \r\n\r\n                sub-section (1).\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23.     ANALYSIS OF THE PROVISIONS:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Section   4(1)   lays   down   that   whenever   it   appears   to   the   appropriate \r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment that land in any locality is needed or is likely to be needed for \r\n\r\n\r\nany   public   purpose   or   for   a   company,   then   a   notification   to   that   effect   is \r\n\r\n\r\nrequired to be published in the Official Gazette and two daily newspapers \r\n\r\n\r\nhaving   circulation   in   the   locality.     Of   these,   one   paper   has   to   be   in   the \r\n\r\n\r\nregional language.  A duty is also cast on the Collector, as defined in Section \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3(c), to cause public notice of the substance of such notification to be given \r\n\r\n\r\nat convenient places in the locality.  The last date of publication and giving \r\n\r\n\r\nof   public   notice   is   treated   as   the   date   of   publication   of   the   notification. \r\n\r\n\r\nSection   4(2)   lays   down   that   after   publication   of   the   notification   under \r\n\r\n\r\nSection   4(1),   any   officer   authorised   by   the  Government  in  this   behalf,   his \r\n\r\n\r\nservants or workmen can enter upon and survey and take levels of any land \r\n\r\n\r\nin   the   locality   or to   dig   or   bore   into   the   sub-soil   and   to   do   all   other   acts \r\n\r\n\r\nnecessary for ascertaining that land is suitable for the purpose of acquisition. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe   concerned  officer,  his   servants  or  workmen   can  fix   the  boundaries  of \r\n\r\n\r\nland   proposed   to   be   acquired   and   the   intended   line   of   the   work,   if   any, \r\n\r\n\r\nproposed to be made on it.  They can also mark such levels and boundaries \r\n\r\n\r\nby   marks   and   cutting   trenches   and   cut   down   and   clear   any   part   of   any \r\n\r\n\r\nstanding crops, fence or jungle for the purpose of completing the survey and \r\n\r\n\r\ntaking level, marking of boundaries and line.   However, neither the officer \r\n\r\n\r\nnor his servants or workmen can, without the consent of the occupier, enter \r\n\r\n\r\ninto   any   building   or   upon   any   enclosed   court   or   garden   attached   to   a \r\n\r\n\r\ndwelling house without giving seven days\' notice to the occupier.     Section \r\n\r\n\r\n5A,  which   embodies  the  most   important  dimension  of  the  rules  of  natural \r\n\r\n\r\njustice,   lays   down   that   any   person   interested   in   any   land   notified   under \r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4(1) may, within 30 days of publication of the notification, submit \r\n\r\n\r\nobjection in writing against the proposed acquisition of land or of any land \r\n\r\n\r\nin the locality to the Collector.  The Collector is required to give the objector \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan opportunity of being heard either in person or by any person authorized \r\n\r\n\r\nby him or by pleader.  After hearing the objector (s) and making such further \r\n\r\n\r\ninquiry,   as   he   may   think   necessary,   the   Collector   has   to   make   a   report   in \r\n\r\n\r\nrespect of land notified under Section 4(1) with his recommendations on the \r\n\r\n\r\nobjections and forward the same to the Government along with the record of \r\n\r\n\r\nthe proceedings held by him.   The Collector can make  different reports in \r\n\r\n\r\nrespect of different parcels of land proposed to be acquired.  Upon receipt of \r\n\r\n\r\nthe Collector\'s report, the appropriate Government is required to take action \r\n\r\n\r\nunder Section 6(1) which lays down that after considering the report, if any, \r\n\r\n\r\nmade   under   Section   5-A   (2),   the   appropriate   Government   is   satisfied   that \r\n\r\n\r\nany particular land is needed for a public purpose, then a declaration to that \r\n\r\n\r\neffect   is   required   to   be   made   under   the   signatures   of   a   Secretary   to   the \r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment   or   of   some   officer   duly   authorised   to   certify   its   orders.   This \r\n\r\n\r\nsection also envisages making of different declarations from time to time in \r\n\r\n\r\nrespect of different parcels of land covered by the same notification issued \r\n\r\n\r\nunder   Section   5(1).     In   terms   of  clause   (ii)   of   proviso   to   Section   6(1),   no \r\n\r\n\r\ndeclaration in respect of any particular land covered by a notification issued \r\n\r\n\r\nunder   Section   4(1),   which   is   published   after   24.9.1989   can   be   made   after \r\n\r\n\r\nexpiry of one year from the date of publication of the notification.  To put it \r\n\r\n\r\ndifferently,  a declaration  is required  to be made  under Section  6(1) within \r\n\r\n\r\none year from the date of publication of the notification under Section 4(1). \r\n\r\n\r\nIn   terms   of   Section   6(2),   every   declaration   made   under   Section   6(1)   is \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrequired to be published in the official gazette and in two daily newspapers \r\n\r\n\r\nhaving circulation in the locality in which land proposed to be acquired is \r\n\r\n\r\nsituated.     Of   these,   at   least   one   must   be   in   the   regional   language.     The \r\n\r\n\r\nCollector   is   also   required   to   cause   public   notice   of   the   substance   of   such \r\n\r\n\r\ndeclaration to be given at convenient places in the locality.  The declaration \r\n\r\n\r\nto   be   published   under   Section   6(2)   must   contain   the   district   or   other \r\n\r\n\r\nterritorial   division   in   which   land   is   situate,   the   purpose   for   which   it   is \r\n\r\n\r\nneeded,   its   approximate   area   or  a   plan  is   made   in  respect   of   land  and   the \r\n\r\n\r\nplace where such plan can be inspected.   Section 6 (3) lays down that the \r\n\r\n\r\ndeclaration made under Section 6(1) shall be conclusive evidence of the fact \r\n\r\n\r\nthat land is needed for a public purpose. After publication of the declaration \r\n\r\n\r\nunder   Section   6,   the   Collector   is   required   to   take   order   from   the   State \r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment for the acquisition of land to be carved out and measured and \r\n\r\n\r\nplanned (Sections 7 and 8). The next stage as envisaged is issue of public \r\n\r\n\r\nnotice   and   individual   notice   to   the   persons   interested   in   land   to   file   their \r\n\r\n\r\nclaim for compensation. Section 11 envisages holding of an enquiry into the \r\n\r\n\r\nclaim and passing of an award by the Collector who is required to take into \r\n\r\n\r\nconsideration the provisions contained in Section 23. Section 16 lays down \r\n\r\n\r\nthat after making an award the Collector can take possession of land which \r\n\r\n\r\nshall thereafter  vest in the Government. Section  17(1) postulates taking of \r\n\r\n\r\npossession of land without making an award.  If the appropriate Government \r\n\r\n\r\ndecides   that   land   proposed   to   be   acquired   is   urgently   needed   for   a   public \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npurpose   then   it   can   authorise   the   competent   authority   to   take   possession. \r\n\r\n\r\nSection 17(2) contemplates a different type of urgency in which, the State \r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment   can   authorise   taking   of   possession   even   before   expiry   of   15 \r\n\r\n\r\ndays period specified in Section 9 (1).  Section 17(4) lays down that in cases \r\n\r\n\r\nwhere   appropriate   Government   comes   to   the   conclusion   that   there   is \r\n\r\n\r\nexistence   of   an   urgency   or   unforeseen   emergency,   it   can   direct   that \r\n\r\n\r\nprovisions of Section 5-A shall not apply.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n24.      Before   adverting   to   the   precedents   in   which   Section   5A   has   been \r\n\r\n\r\ninterpreted by this Court, it will be useful to notice development of the law \r\n\r\n\r\nrelating   to   the   rule   of   hearing.   In   the   celebrated   case   of  Cooper   v. \r\n\r\n\r\nWandsworth Board of Works (1863) 143 ER 414, the principle was stated \r\n\r\n\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n\r\n         \"Even God did not pass a sentence upon Adam, before he was \r\n\r\n         called upon to make his defence.  \"Adam\" says God, \"where art \r\n\r\n         thou?     hast   thou   not   eaten   of   the   tree   whereof   I   commanded \r\n\r\n         thee that thou shouldest not eat\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTherein   the   District   Board   had   brought   down   the   house   of   the   plaintiff\'s \r\n\r\n\r\n(Cooper),   because   he   had   failed   to   comply   with   The   Metropolis   Local \r\n\r\n\r\nManagement Act.   The Act required the plaintiff to notify the board seven \r\n\r\n\r\ndays before starting to build the house.  Cooper argued that even though the \r\n\r\n\r\nboard had the legal authority to tear his house down, no person should be \r\n\r\n\r\ndeprived of their property without notice.  In spite of no express words in the \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstatute the court recognized the right of hearing before the plaintiff\'s house \r\n\r\n\r\nbuilt without permission was demolished in the exercise of statutory powers. \r\n\r\n\r\nByles J stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               `Although there are not positive words in a statute \r\n\r\n               requiring   that   the   party   shall   be   heard,   yet   the \r\n\r\n               justice   of   the   common   law   shall   supply   the \r\n\r\n               omission of the legislature\'.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n25.    Perhaps the best known statement on the right to be heard has come \r\n\r\n\r\nfrom Lord Loreburn, L.C. in Board of Education v. Rice (1911 AC 179 at \r\n\r\n\r\n182), where he observed: \r\n\r\n\r\n       \"Comparatively   recent   statutes   have   extended,   if   they   have \r\n\r\n       originated, the practice of imposing upon departments or offices \r\n\r\n       of   State   the   duty   of   deciding   or   determining   questions   of \r\n\r\n       various kindsIn such cases they must act in good faith and \r\n\r\n       fairly listen to both sides, for that is a duty lying upon everyone \r\n\r\n       who   decides   anything.     But   I   do   not   think   they   are   bound   to \r\n\r\n       treat such questions as though it were a trial they can obtain \r\n\r\n       information   in   any   way   they   think   best,   always   giving   a   fair \r\n\r\n       opportunity   to   those   who   are   parties   in   the   controversy   for \r\n\r\n       correcting or contradicting any relevant statement prejudicial in \r\n\r\n       their view.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n26.    In  Ridge   v.   Baldwin  1964   AC   40   Lord   Reid   emphasized   on   the \r\n\r\n\r\nuniversality of the right to a fair hearing whether it concerns the property or \r\n\r\n\r\ntenure   of   an   office   or   membership   of   an   institution.     In  O\'Reilly   v. \r\n\r\n\r\nMackman 1983 2 AC 237, Lord Diplock said that the right of a man to be \r\n\r\n\r\ngiven   a   fair   opportunity   of   hearing,   what   is   alleged   against   him   and   of \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npresenting his own case is so fundamental to any civilized legal system that \r\n\r\n\r\nit is to be presumed that Parliament intended that failure to observe the same \r\n\r\n\r\nshould   render   null   and   void   any   decision   reached   in   breach   of   this \r\n\r\n\r\nrequirement.  In Lloyd v. Mcmahon 1987 AC 625 Lord Bridge said:\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"My   Lords,   the   so-called   rules   of   natural   justice   are   not \r\n\r\n        engraved  on tablets  of  stone.   To  use  the  phrase   which better \r\n\r\n        expresses   the   underlying   concept,   what   the   requirements   of \r\n\r\n        fairness   demand   when   any   body,   domestic,   administrative   or \r\n\r\n        judicial, has to make a decision which will affect the rights of \r\n\r\n        individuals   depends   on   the   character   of   the   decision-making \r\n\r\n        body, the kind of decision it has to make and the statutory or \r\n\r\n        other framework in which it operates. In particular, it is well-\r\n\r\n        established  that when a statute has conferred on any body the \r\n\r\n        power  to make   decisions  affecting  individuals,  the  courts  will \r\n\r\n        not  only  require   the   procedure  prescribed  by  the  statute  to  be \r\n\r\n        followed,   but   will   readily   imply   so   much   and   no   more   to   be \r\n\r\n        introduced  by way of additional procedural  safeguards  as will \r\n\r\n        ensure the attainment of fairness.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n27.     In the United States, principles of natural justice usually find support \r\n\r\n\r\nfrom the Due Process clause of the Constitution.  The extent of due process \r\n\r\n\r\nprotection   required   is   determined   by   a   number   of   factors;   first   the   private \r\n\r\n\r\ninterest   that   will   be   affected   by   the   official   action;   second,   the   risk   of   an \r\n\r\n\r\nerroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the \r\n\r\n\r\nprobable   value,   if   any,   of   additional   or   substitute   procedural   requirement \r\n\r\n\r\nwould entail.  \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n28.    The   amplitude,   ambit   and   width  of   the   rule   of  audi  alteram   partem \r\n\r\n\r\nwas lucidly stated by the three-Judge bench in  Sayeedur Rehman v. State \r\n\r\n\r\nof Bihar (1973) 3 SCC 333 in the following words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               \"11This   unwritten   right   of   hearing   is \r\n\r\n               fundamental   to   a   just   decision   by   any   authority   which \r\n\r\n               decides   a   controversial   issue   affecting   the   rights   of   the \r\n\r\n               rival contestants. This right has its roots in the notion of \r\n\r\n               fair   procedure.   It   draws   the   attention   of   the   party \r\n\r\n               concerned to the imperative necessity of not overlooking \r\n\r\n               the other side of the case before coming to its decision, \r\n\r\n               for   nothing   is   more   likely   to   conduce   to   just   and   right \r\n\r\n               decision   than   the   practice   of   giving   hearing   to   the \r\n\r\n               affected parties.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n29.    In  Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner  (1978) 1 \r\n\r\n\r\nSCC   405,   Krishna   Iyer   J.   speaking   for   himself,   Beg   CJ   and   Bhagwati   J. \r\n\r\n\r\nhighlighted the importance of rule of hearing in the following words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               \"43. Indeed, natural justice is a pervasive facet of secular \r\n\r\n               law   where   a   spiritual   touch   enlivens   legislation, \r\n\r\n               administration and adjudication, to make fairness a creed \r\n\r\n               of life. It has, many colours and shades, many forms and \r\n\r\n               shapes   and,   save   where   valid   law   excludes   it,   applies \r\n\r\n               when   people   are   affected   by   acts   of   authority.   It   is   the \r\n\r\n               hone   of   healthy   government,   recognised   from   earliest \r\n\r\n               times   and   not   a   mystic   testament   of   Judge-made   law. \r\n\r\n               Indeed,   from   the   legendary   days   of   Adam   --   and   of \r\n\r\n               Kautilya\'s  Arthasastra  --   the   rule   of   law   has   had   this \r\n\r\n               stamp of natural justice which makes it social justice. We \r\n\r\n               need   not   go   into   these   deeps   for   the   present   except   to \r\n\r\n               indicate that the roots of natural justice and its foliage are \r\n\r\n               noble and not new-fangled. Today its application must be \r\n\r\n               sustained by current legislation, case-law or other extant \r\n\r\n               principle, not the hoary chords of legend and history. Our \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               jurisprudence has sanctioned its prevalence even like the \r\n\r\n               Anglo-American system.\r\n\r\n                                                                  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n               48.  Once we understand the soul of the rule as fair play \r\n\r\n               in action -- and it is so -- we must hold that it extends to \r\n\r\n               both   the   fields.   After   all,   administrative   power   in   a \r\n\r\n               democratic set-up is not allergic to fairness in action and \r\n\r\n               discretionary   executive   justice   cannot   degenerate   into \r\n\r\n          The High Court was justified in non-suiting the appellants on the ground that they had not raised a specific plea supported by a proper affidavit to question the decision taken by the State Government to invoke Section 17(1) and 17(4) of the Act. There was not any valid ground or justification for invoking the urgency provision contained in Section 17(1) and to exclude the application of Section 5A for the acquisition of land for planned industrial development of the district. The acquisition is primarily meant to cater private interest in the name of industrial development of the district. No evidence has been produced before the Court to show that the State Government and/or agencies/instrumentalities of the State are intending to establish industrial units on the acquired land either by itself or through its agencies/instrumentalities. The Supreme Court observed that even if planned industrial development of the district is treated as public purpose within the meaning of Section 4, there was no urgency which could justify the exercise of power by the State Government under Section 17(1) and 17(4). The private entrepreneurs, who are desirous of making investment in the State, take their own time in setting up the industrial units. Therefore, time required for ensuring compliance of the provisions contained in Section 5-A cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be portrayed as delay which will frustrate the purpose of acquisition and it was held that there was no real and substantive urgency to justify invoking of the urgency provision under Section 17(1) and to exclude the application of Section 5-A. The order of the High Court set aside. The respondents are directed to proceed from the stage of Section 4 notification and take appropriate action after complying with Section 5-A(1) and (2) of the Act. The appeal was allowed. Appeals Allowed','Daya Shankar Vs State Of M.P Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.\n\n\n\n1.    Leave granted.\n\n\n\n2.    Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a Division Bench of the\n\nMadhya Pradesh High Court upholding the conviction of the appellant for\n\noffence punishable under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the Indian\n\nPenal Code, 1860 (in short the `IPC&apos;) as was awarded by learned Additional\n\nSessions Judge, Panna, in Sessions Trial No.15/1992.\n3.    Prosecution version as unfolded during trial is as follows:\n\n\n\n      On 30th November, 1991 at about 5.00 p.m. Ram Kishore (hereinafter\n\nreferred to as the `deceased&apos;) was murdered in an agricultural field. First\n\nInformation Report was lodged by Manik Lal at Police Station, Pawal in the\n\nevening at about 7.00 p.m. Offence was registered as Crime No.124/91\n\nunder Section 302/34 IPC. Deceased had eloped with Lalli, sister of\n\nRamcharan (A-2) and both of them had performed court marriage. The court\n\nmarriage was registered and Lalli was living with Ramkishore. The\n\nappellant was having enmity with deceased on account of aforesaid\n\nincident. Deceased after eloping with Lalli was living in some other village\n\nand returned to his village a month before the incident. Ramkishore had\n\ngone to answer the call of nature in the evening on 30.11.1991 at about 4.30\n\np.m. towards the agricultural field of Gadka. Around 5 p.m. Phulla (A-3)\n\narmed with axe, Ramcharan (A-2) armed with sword alongwith\n\nDayashankar (A-1) and Munni Lal (A-4) went to the field of Gadaka. Munni\n\nLal and Dayashankar were barehanded. Phulla gave axe blow on the head of\n\ndeceased. Thereafter, Dayashankar and Munnilal, the co-accused pulled the\n\nlegs of deceased and threw him on the ground. Ram Kishore fell on the\n\n\n\n \ncrops in the field. Ramcharan assaulted the deceased by sword on the chest.\n\nThen he placed his sword on the chest of the deceased. On account of\n\nbeating he died. Police after receiving information of the commission of\n\ncrime carried out the investigation, arrested the accused persons and filed\n\nthe challan on 3.1.1992 before the Court of Judicial Magistrate. Case was\n\ncommitted to the Court of Sessions Judge. Trial Court framed charges under\n\nSection 302/34 IPC against the accused persons. After recording the\n\nevidence the trial Court convicted the accused persons for offence under\n\nSections 302 read with Section 34 IPC and sentenced them as afore-noted.\n\n\n\n      Before the High Court the basic stand was that the prosecution failed\n\nto prove common intention on the part of the appellants and, therefore,\n\nSection 34 had no application. The individual act of the appellant should\n\nhave been considered. Merely because the appellant had accompanied other\n\naccused persons, that cannot be sufficient to warrant presumption of\n\ncommon intention.\n\n\n\n4.    Learned counsel for the State submitted that the eye witnesses PWs 2\n\nand 3 had described the act of each of the appellants and the role ascribed to\n\nthe appellant was that he pulled the leg of the deceased as a result of which\n\n\n\n \ndeceased fell in the field of Masur crop and thereafter he was assaulted by\n\nother accused persons. The appeal was dismissed accepting the stand of the\n\nState.\n\n\n\n5.       Learned counsel for the appellant re-iterated the stand taken before\n\nthe High Court and submitted that Section 34 IPC has no application.\n\n\n\n6.       Learned counsel for the State on the other hand supported the\n\njudgment.\n\n\n\n7.       Section 34 has been enacted on the principle of joint liability in the\n\ndoing of a criminal act. The Section is only a rule of evidence and does not\n\ncreate a substantive offence. The distinctive feature of the Section is the\n\neleme Indian Penal Code, 1860 - Section 302/34 - Murder- - Conviction and sentence- - Whether calls for obstruction?- - Held, \"yes\"- - Evidence of observers did not credit any clear demonstration to litigant - Mere truth that he was in organization of blamed who were equipped - Not adequate to draw in Section 34- - Appellant not outfitted - He had no ill will with expired - Stand that he pulled leg of perished - Not built up - Not suitable to hold appealing party blameworthy by utilization of Section 34- - His conviction put aside.

Krishnamurthy and R. Gopdlakrishnan, for the appellant.\nH.   R.	 Gokhale,  B.  Subbiah	and  R.	 Thiagaraian,	for,\nrespondents Nos. 2 and 4.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRamaswami,  J. The plaintiff G. Narayana Raju filed O.S.  34\nof  1951-52  in	 the Court of  District	 Judge,	 Mysore	 for\npartition   and	 separate  possession  of  suit	  properties\nmentioned in the various schedules of the plaint.  The first\ndefendant is the brother\n \nof  the	 plaintiff.  The second defendant is  the  widow  of\nMuniswami  Raju, the eldest brother of the  plaintiff.	 The\nthird	defendant  is  the  legal  representative   of	 the\nplaintiffs  mother.  She is now the, appellant	having	been\nbrought	 on  record  as	 the  legal  representative  of	 the\ndeceased  plaintiff. The case of the original plaintiff	 was\nthat he, the first defendant and Muniswami Raju (husband  of\nthe  second defendant) were the sons of one Gopala Raju	 and\nwere all members of the joint family Gopalaraju died in	 May\n1931  and  after his death the plaintiff  and  his  brothers\ncontinued  to  be members of the joint	family.	  The  joint\nstatus	of  the,  family  was severed  by  the	issue  of  a\nregistered notice by the first defendant to the plaintiff in\nJuly 1951.  An ancestral house in Nazar bad belonging to the\nfamily was acquired by the City IuprovementTrust Board in or\nabout the year 1909.  Out of the compensation paid for	that\nhouse and supplemented by the earnings of the members of the\njoint  family, the house item No. I of Schedule &apos;A&apos;  to	 the\nplaint	was  purchased by Gopalaraju in or  about  the	year\n1910.	Subsequently  item No. 2 of Schedule  &apos;A&apos;  was	also\npurchased by Gopalaraju from the income of item No. I supple\nmented	by the earnings of the members of the  family.	 All\nthe other items of properties mentioned in Schedule &apos;A&apos;	 and\nother Schedules attached to the plaint were acquired out  of\nthe  income  from  items 1 and 2 of  Schedule  &apos;A&apos;,  It	 was\nfurther	 alleged that the business known as \"Ambika  Stores\"\nwas  also the joint family business and all  the  properties\nmentioned in the Schedules except items I and 2 of  Schedule\n&apos;A&apos;  were acquired out of the income of the members  of	 the\nfamily	including  the income from the	business  of  Ambika\nStores.	  The plaintiff accordingly claimed that he and	 the\nfirst defendant would each be entitled to get 5/14ths  share\nand  the second and third defendants would each be  entitled\nto  get	 2/14ths. share.  In the alternative  the  plaintiff\npleaded	 that  if  for any reason the Court  held  that	 the\nproperties stand in the name of Muniswami Raju and were	 not\nacquired with the aidof the joint familv nucleus, he and the\nsecond defendant were entitled to equal shares as  co-owners\nof the joint family business.  The suit was mainly contested\nby  the	 second defendant who asserted that  the  properties\nmentioned  in  all the Schedules of the	 plaint	 were  self-\nacquisitions of Miiniswami Raju and constituted his separate\nproperties.  It was alleged that Muniswami Raju was the only\ncarniiig member of the family at the time of the acquisition\nof items 1 and 2 of Schedule operties and the plaintiff	 and\nthe  first defendant were emploved,in petty jobs  in  Wesley\nPress.	 Muniswami Raju later on employed the  plaintiff  in\nhis  -shop  as	a salaried servant and	the  latter  had  no\nproprietary  right in the business of Ambika Stores.   After\nconsideration  of  the	oral and  documentary  evidence	 the\nDistrict Judge held that the plaintiff, first defendant	 and\nMuniswami  Raju were not divided and that the only  property\nwhich was divisible was item No. I of Schedule\n \n&apos;A&apos;  and  there	 was not sufficient  ancestral	nucleus	 for\nacquisition of the other properties and that all  properties\nexcept item No. 1 of Schedule &apos;A were the self	acquisitions\nof  Muniswami Raju, that Muniswami I Raju never blended	 his\nproperties with that of the joint family that the  plaintiff\nwas  only an employee under Muniswami Raju and therefore  he\nwas not entitled to the alternativ &apos; relief claimed by	him.\nAccordingly, the District Judge granted a preliminary decree\nholding	 that the plaintiff was entitled to 2/7ths share  in\nitem  No. I of Schedule &apos;A&apos;.  The plaintiff took the  matter\nin  appeal to the Mysore High Court.  By its judgment  dated\nMarch  25,  1960 the High Court affirmed the decree  of	 the\ntrial court with the modification that besides item No. I of\nSchedule  &apos;A&apos;  item No. 2 also should be hold  to  be  joint\nfamily property and the plaintiff was entitled to  partition\nof  his share in this item also.  The High  Court  cancelled\nthe  I	direction of the District Judge that  the  plaintiff\nshould	account for the moneys and properties  of  Muniswami\nRaju  -in  his hands before he is given	 possession  of	 his\nshare.\nThis  appeal  is  brought by certificate on  behalf  of	 the\nplaintiff  from the judgment of the Mysore High Court  dated\nMarch 25, 1960 in R.A. No. 155 of 1953.\nThe  first  question  to be considered	in  this  appeal  is\nwhether	 the  business	of  Ambika  Stores  was	 really	 the\nbusiness  of the joint family and whether the plaintiff	 was\nentitled. to a partition of his share in the assets of	that\nbusiness.: It was contended on behalf of the appellant	that\nthe  business of Ambika Stores grew out of a nucleus of	 the\njoint family funds of at least by the efforts of the members\nof  the joint family include the appellant.  The  contention\nof the appellant has been negatived by both the lower courts\nand there is a concurrent finding that the Ambika Stores was\nthe  separate business of Muniswami Raju and it was  neither\nthe  joint  family  business nor  treated  as  joint  family\nbusiness, It is wellestablished that there is no presumption\nunder Hindu law that a business standing in the name of	 any\nmember	of the joint family is a joint family business	even\nif that member is the manager, of the joint family.  Unless,\nit  could  be shown that the business in the  hands  of	 the\ncoparcener  grew up with the assistance of the joint  family\nproperty  or joint family funds or that the earnings of	 the\nbusiness  were	blended with the joint	family	estate,	 the\nbusiness remains free and separate.  The question  therefore\nwhether	 the  business	was begun or  carried  on  with	 the\nassistance of joint family property or joint family funds or\nas  a  -family	business is a  question	 of  fact.-(See	 the\ndecisions of the Judicial Committee in Bhwu Mal v. Jagannath\n(1)  and in Pearey Lal v. Nanak Chand (1) and of this  Court\nin Chattahatha Karayalar v. Ramachandra\n(1)   A.T.R 1943 P.C 40.\n(2)   A.T.R. 1948 P.C  108.\n \nlyer)  (1).   In  the present, case there  is  a  concurrent\nfinding of both the lower courts that the business of Ambika\nStores	was a separate, business of Muniswami Raju  and	 it,\nwas  neither  a joint family business nor treated  as  joint\nfamily business.  The concurrent finding of the lower courts\non  this issue is upon a finding of fact and  following	 the\nusual practice of this Court, it is not now open to  further\nscrutiny by this Court under Art. 133 of the Constitution.\nIt  was, however, contended on behalf of the appellant	that\nthe finding of the lower. courts is vitiated in, law because\nof  the circumstance that they have not taken  into  account\nthree important documents, Ex.	D, Ex.	E and Ex.  DDD.	  We\nare  unable  to	 accept this argument  as  correct.   It  is\nmanifest on a perusal of the judgment of the High Court that\nall  the documents have been examined, regarding  the  issue\nwhether	 the  business of Ambika Stores was a  joint  family\nbusiness  or whether it was p. separate, business  of  Muni-\nswami  Raju.  As regards Ex.  D, the High-,Court has,  after\nexamining the evidence adduced, remarked that the, mere fact\nthat  item No. 2 of Schedule &apos;A was given as a	security  by\nMuniswami Raju did not result in any detriment to the  joint\nfamily	property and, it cannot therefore be held  that	 the\nbusiness of Ambika Stores grew out of the joint family funds\nor with the aid of the joint family funds.  On behalf of the\nappellant  reliance was placed on the recitals in Ex.  E,  a\ndeed of mortgage dated July 26, 1928 executed by Gopalaraju,\nMuniswamiraju  and  the appellant in favour  of	 the  Mysore\nBank.	The  property  that had been  mortgaged	 under	this\ndocument is item No. 2 of Schedule &apos;A&apos;.	 The recital is that\nthe  borrowing from the Bank was for the business and  trade\nof  the	 executants and -for the benefit and  use  of  their\nfamily.	  There is also a recital in an earlier	 portion  of\nthe document that the business, was being carried on for the\nbenefit	 of  the  family, but it is not quite  clear  as  to\nwhether this related to the business carried on by  Narayana\nRaju  or whether it was intended to relate to some  business\ncarried on by all the three executants.	 It is possible that\nthe  appellant had other business of his own carried on	 -on\nhis own. account at that time and it cannot be, assumed that\nthe borrowing under Ex.	 E must have been for the purpose of\nAmbika	Stores.	 It should be noticed that  Muniswarni	Raju\nhas  been  described in the document as	 the  proprietor  of\nAmbika Stores which description is. not consistent with	 the\ncontention  of the appellant that the business, was a  joint\nfamily	business.  The High Court has, in  this	 connection,\nreferred  to Ex.  I an application dated February 14,  1929,\nby  the	 appellant  to the City	 Co-operative  Bank,  Mysore\nwherein, the appellant has said that he was getting a decent\nearning	 by  doing;  out-of-door  commercial  business	with\nAmbika	Stores.	 There is also the, recital in Ex.   I	that\nMuniswami Raju was the proprietor of Ambika Stores.   Having\nregard to this recital in I it is not-\n(1)  A.I.R. 1955 S.C. 799.\n \nunlikely that the appellant had some business of his own  at\nthe  material time and it cannot be assumed  that  borrowing\nunder Ex.  E, was for the purpose of Ambika Stores  business\nonly.  The High Court has also dealt with the effect of	 Ex.\nDDD, mortgage deed produced on behalf of the appellant.	  It\nis  true that in this document the appellant  and  Muniswami\nRaju  have been described as proprietors of  Ambika  Stores.\nThe finding of the High Court is that this recital was	made\nin the document for the purposes of borrowing from the Bank.\nReference was made in this context to a letter dated May  5,\n1931,  Ex.  75 written by Muniswami Raju  as  proprietor  of\nAmbika	Stores to the Bank of Mysore.  In&apos; this	 letter,  he\nhas requested the Bank to take note of the fact that he	 has\nauthorised the appellant to accept drafts, and sign  letters\netc. on behalf of the firm&apos; There is another Letter, Ex. 76,\ndated  April 14, 1934 written by Muniswami Raju to the	Bank\nof  Mysore wherein Muniswami Raju has been described as	 the\nproprietor  of Ambika Stores and there is an  intimation  to\nthe Bank, that the appellant Narayana Raju was authorised to\nsign  for the firm.  In the context and background of  these\ncircumstances  it is evident that though both the  appellant\nand  Muniswami Raju were described as proprietors of  Ambika\nStores the description was only for the purpose of borrowing\nmoney  from the Bank, as contended for by  the	respondents.\nIn  this  connection  the High Court  has  also	 taken	into\naccount Ex. 7 5 (b), a letter written by Muniswami Raju.  In\nthis  letter  Muniswami Raju has described  himself  as	 the\nproprietor of Ambika Stores and has instructed the Bank that\nhe   The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Ramaswami, J. The plaintiff G. Narayana Raju filed O.S. 34 of 1951-52 in the Court of District Judge, Mysore for partition and separate possession of suit properties mentioned in the various schedules of the plaint. The first defendant is the brother of the plaintiff. The second defendant is the widow of Muniswami Raju, the eldest brother of the plaintiff. The third defendant is the legal representative of the plaintiffs mother. She is now the, appellant having been brought on record as the legal representative of the deceased plaintiff. The case of the original plaintiff was that he, the first defendant and Muniswami Raju (husband of the second defendant) were the sons of one Gopala Raju and were all members of the joint family Gopalaraju died in May 1931 and after his death the plaintiff and his brothers continued to be members of the joint family. The joint status of the, family was severed by the issue of a registered notice by the first defendant to the plaintiff in July 1951. An ancestral house in Nazar bad belonging to the family was acquired by the City IuprovementTrust Board in or about the year 1909. Out of the compensation paid for that house and supplemented by the earnings of the members of the joint family, the house item No. I of Schedule \'A\' to the plaint was purchased by Gopalaraju in or about the year 1910. Subsequently item No. 2 of Schedule \'A\' was also purchased by Gopalaraju from the income of item No. I supple mented by the earnings of the members of the family. All the other items of properties mentioned in Schedule \'A\' and other Schedules attached to the plaint were acquired out of the income from items 1 and 2 of Schedule \'A\', It was further alleged that the business known as \"Ambika Stores\" was also the joint family business and all the properties mentioned in the Schedules except items I and 2 of Schedule \'A\' were acquired out of the income of the members of the family including the income from the business of Ambika Stores. The plaintiff accordingly claimed that he and the first defendant would each be entitled to get 5/14ths share and the second and third defendants would each be entitled to get 2/14ths. share. In the alternative the plaintiff pleaded that if for any reason the Court held that the properties stand in the name of Muniswami Raju and were not acquired with the aidof the joint familv nucleus, he and the second defendant were entitled to equal shares as co-owners of the joint family business. The suit was mainly contested by the second defendant who asserted that the properties mentioned in all the Schedules of the plaint were self- acquisitions of Miiniswami Raju and constituted his separate properties. It was alleged that Muniswami Raju was the only carniiig member of the family at the time of the acquisition of items 1 and 2 of Schedule operties and the plaintiff and the first defendant were emploved,in petty jobs in Wesley Press. Muniswami Raju later on employed the plaintiff in his -shop as a salaried servant and the latter had no proprietary right in the business of Ambika Stores. After consideration of the oral and documentary evidence the District Judge held that the plaintiff, first defendant and Muniswami Raju were not divided and that the only property which was divisible was item No. I of Schedule \'A\' and there was not sufficient ancestral nucleus for acquisition of the other properties and that all properties except item No. 1 of Schedule \'A were the self acquisitions of Muniswami Raju, that Muniswami I Raju never blended his properties with that of the joint family that the plaintiff was only an employee under Muniswami Raju and therefore he was not entitled to the alternativ \' relief claimed by him. Accordingly, the District Judge granted a preliminary decree holding that the plaintiff was entitled to 2/7ths share in item No. I of Schedule \'A\'. The plaintiff took the matter in appeal to the Mysore High Court. By its judgment dated March 25, 1960 the High Court affirmed the decree of the trial court with the modification that besides item No. I of Schedule \'A\' item No. 2 also should be hold to be joint family property and the plaintiff was entitled to partition of his share in this item also. The High Court cancelled the I direction of the District Judge that the plaintiff should account for the moneys and properties of Muniswami Raju -in his hands before he is given possession of his share.\r\n\r\n\r\nheld:  the appellant during Muniswami Raju\'s life-time of his being a co-owner of the partnership business, nor is there any evidence of recognition by Muniswami Raju of any such right of the appellant. On the other hand, there is sufficient evidence to show that whatever the appellant did in connection with the business was only done with the Authority conferd by Muniswami Raju. In our opinion the High Court has rightly rejected the claim of the appellant that he was a co-owner of the partnership business.\r\n\r\ncourt  the reason expressed we hold that this appeal has no merit and it must be dismissed with costs.\r\n\r\n Appeal was dismissed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ','Rathnavathi & Anr Vs Kavita Ganashamdas Abhay Manohar Sapre, J.\r\n\r\n1.    Leave granted.\r\n\r\n2.    The plaintiff  filed  two  suits,  one  for  specific  performance  of\r\nagreement and other for grant of permanent injunction  in  relation  to  the\r\nsuit  house.  The  trial  court  vide  common  judgment  and  decree   dated\r\n16.10.2001 dismissed both the suits. The first appellate  court,  i.e.,  the\r\nHigh Court, in appeal, by impugned  judgment  and  decree  dated  08.09.2011\r\nreversed the judgment and decree of the trial court  and  decreed  both  the\r\nsuits in appeal, against the defendants.  Being aggrieved  by  the  judgment\r\nand decree of the High Court, Defendants 1 and 3 have approached this  Court\r\nin the instant civil appeals.\r\n3.    The question arises for consideration in these appeals is whether  the\r\nHigh Court was justified in allowing the  first  appeals  preferred  by  the\r\nplaintiff, resulting in decreeing the two civil suits against defendants  in\r\nrelation to suit house?\r\n4.    In order to appreciate the controversy involved in  the  civil  suits,\r\nand now in these appeals, it is necessary to state the relevant facts.\r\n5.    For the sake of convenience, description of parties  herein  is  taken\r\nfrom Original Suit No.223/2000.\r\n6.    Defendant no.2 is the original owner of the suit house  and  defendant\r\nno.1 is the subsequent purchaser of the suit house from defendant no.2.\r\n7.    The dispute relates to a dwelling house bearing no. 351  Block  no.11,\r\nMatadahalli Extension,  now  known  as  R.T.  Nagar  Bangalore  (hereinafter\r\nreferred to as \" the suit house    ).\r\n8.    The suit house  was  purchased  by  defendant  no.  2  from  Bangalore\r\nDevelopment  Authority  (in  short     BDA   )  in  a  scheme.   On  15.02.1989,\r\nDefendant no. 2 entered into an agreement (Annexure-P-1) with plaintiff  for\r\nsale of suit house at a total consideration of Rs. 3,50,000/-. In  terms  of\r\nclause 2 of the agreement, the plaintiff paid  a  sum  of  Rs.  50,000/-  as\r\nadvance towards sale consideration. These facts are not in dispute.\r\n9.    On  07.01.2000,  the  plaintiff  filed  a  civil  suit  being  OS  No.\r\n223/2000, initially against 3 defendants for  seeking  permanent  injunction\r\nrestraining  the  defendants  jointly  and  severally  from  interfering  in\r\nplaintiff\'s possession over the  suit  house.  In  substance,  case  of  the\r\nplaintiff was  that  she  entered  into  an  agreement  on  15.02.1989  with\r\ndefendant no. 2 to purchase the suit house for Rs.  3,50,000/-  and  paid  a\r\nsum of Rs. 50,000/- to defendant no. 2 by way of advance  towards  the  sale\r\nconsideration. Later, the plaintiff further paid the  balance  consideration\r\nof Rs. 3 Lacs towards the sale price  and  obtained  receipts  acknowledging\r\nthe payment so made. It was  alleged  that  the  plaintiff  was  accordingly\r\nplaced in actual physical possession of the suit house and  since  then  she\r\nhas been in possession of the suit house. It was alleged that she also  made\r\nsome improvements therein by spending money and is  paying  electricity  and\r\nwater charges etc. It was further alleged that the  plaintiff  was  and  has\r\nalways been ready and willing to perform her part of the  agreement  to  get\r\nthe sale deed executed in her favour after having performed her part of  the\r\ncontract. However, defendant no. 2, for the reasons best known to  her,  did\r\nnot  execute  the  sale  deed  despite  having  received   the   full   sale\r\nconsideration from the plaintiff. It was alleged that defendant no.  1,  who\r\nis a total stranger to the  suit  house  and  having  no  right,  title  and\r\ninterest in the suit house, on 2.1.2000 visited the suit  house  along  with\r\ndefendant no.  2  and  some  other  unwanted  elements  and  threatened  the\r\nplaintiff to dispossess her from the suit house. It was  also  alleged  that\r\non 8.1.2000, defendant nos. 1 and 2 again visited and attempted  to  assault\r\nthe plaintiff and unsuccessfully attempted to commit trespass  in  the  suit\r\nhouse.\r\n10.   On seeing the hostile attitude of defendant nos. 1  and  2  and  their\r\nassociates, the plaintiff immediately lodged a complaint  in  the  concerned\r\npolice station. Since police authorities did not take any action, which  was\r\nrequired of, the plaintiff filed the  aforesaid  civil  suit  for  permanent\r\ninjunction restraining the  defendants  from  interfering  in  her  peaceful\r\npossession over the suit house. It was submitted that the  plaintiff  has  a\r\nprima facie case, so also the balance of convenience  and  irreparable  loss\r\nin her favour, which entitles her to claim permanent injunction against  the\r\ndefendants in relation to the suit house. The plaintiff  also  averred  that\r\nshe reserved her right to file a suit for specific performance of  agreement\r\nagainst the defendants.\r\n11.   The aforesaid suit was contested by defendant nos.  1  and  2.   While\r\nadmitting the ownership of defendant no. 2 over the suit house and the  fact\r\nof entering into an agreement  with  the  plaintiff  for  its  sale  to  the\r\nplaintiff and further while admitting the receipt of advance payment  of  Rs\r\n50,000/- from the plaintiff, the defendants denied all material  allegations\r\nmade in the plaint. It was alleged  that  the  plaintiff  did  not  pay  the\r\nbalance consideration as alleged. It was also alleged that defendant  no.  2\r\non 25.10.1995 cancelled the agreement dt 15.02.1989 by sending legal  notice\r\nto the plaintiff and then  sold  the  suit  house  to  defendant  no.  1  on\r\n09.02.1998 for Rs. 4 lacs and placed her in its possession.\r\n12.   On 31.03.2000, the plaintiff filed another civil  suit  being  OS  No.\r\n2334 of 2000 in  the  Court  of  City  Civil  Judge  Bangalore  against  the\r\ndefendants  for  specific  performance  of  agreement  dated  15.02.1989  in\r\nrelation to the suit house.\r\n13.   After pleading the same facts, which are set out above, the  plaintiff\r\nfurther alleged that she has performed her part of the agreement  by  paying\r\nentire sale consideration of Rs. 3,50,000/- and has been  in  possession  of\r\nthe suit house. It was alleged that  on  the  one  hand,  defendant  no.  2,\r\ndespite having received full sale consideration, did not  perform  her  part\r\nof the agreement by not getting the suit house  transferred  in  plaintiff\'s\r\nfavour as per clause 3 of the agreement and by doing the acts which she  was\r\nexpected to do in terms of agreement,  and  on  the  other  hand,  tried  to\r\ninterfere in plaintiff\'s lawful possession over the suit house.\r\n14.   This led the plaintiff to serve upon defendant  no.2  a  legal  notice\r\ndated 6.3.2000 thereby calling upon defendant no.2 to execute the sale  deed\r\nin relation to suit property in plaintiff\'s favour.  Since  despite  service\r\nof legal notice, defendant no. 2  failed  to  execute  the  same,  suit  for\r\nspecific performance was also filed. The plaintiff then by way of  amendment\r\nalso sought to add one prayer for cancellation of sale deed alleged to  have\r\nbeen executed by defendant  no.  2  in  favour  of  defendant  no.  1.  This\r\namendment was allowed.\r\n15.    The  defendants  contested  the  civil  suit.  While  admitting   the\r\nexecution of agreement dated 15.02.1989 with the plaintiff for sale of  suit\r\nhouse for Rs. 3,50,000/- and also admitting payment of Rs. 50,000/-  by  the\r\nplaintiff to defendant no. 2,  the  defendants  denied  all  other  material\r\nallegations and inter alia alleged that since the plaintiff  failed  to  pay\r\nthe balance sale consideration of Rs. 3 lacs to defendant no. 2 in terms  of\r\nthe agreement, defendant no. 2 on 25.10.1995 sent  a  legal  notice  to  the\r\nplaintiff cancelling the agreement dated 15.2.1989 and sold the  suit  house\r\nto defendant no. 1  on  09.02.1998  for  consideration  and  placed  her  in\r\npossession of the suit house. The defendants  also  alleged  that  defendant\r\nno. 1 was the bona fide purchaser for value and hence her  title  cannot  be\r\nquestioned in the suit.\r\n16.   The defendants also contested the suit on two legal grounds.  Firstly,\r\nit was contended that the suit was not maintainable, as  the  bar  contained\r\nin Order II Rule 2 of Code of Civil Procedure,  1908  (hereinafter  referred\r\nto as \'CPC\') did not permit the plaintiff to  file  the  suit  for  specific\r\nperformance of agreement in question against the defendants. It was  alleged\r\nthat relief to claim specific performance of agreement was available to  the\r\nplaintiff when she filed the first suit  (OS  No.  223/2000)  for  permanent\r\ninjunction against the defendants. Yet, the plaintiff failed  to  claim  the\r\nrelief in the first suit, consequently,  the  second  suit  filed  to  claim\r\nspecific performance of agreement in question is hit by rigor  contained  in\r\nOrder II Rule 2 of CPC. It is now barred and hence liable  to  be  dismissed\r\nas not maintainable. Secondly, it was contended that the suit  is  otherwise\r\nbarred by limitation having been filed beyond  the  period  of  three  years\r\nfrom the date of accrual of cause of action as provided  in  Article  54  of\r\nthe Limitation Act, 1963. It was, therefore,  contended  that  the  suit  is\r\nliable to be dismissed as being barred by limitation, as well.\r\n17.   The trial court consolidated both the suits  for  trial.  Issues  were\r\nframed. Parties adduced  evidence.  The  trial  court  vide  judgment/decree\r\ndated 25.8.2009 though  answered  some  issues  in  plaintiff\'s  favour  but\r\neventually dismissed the civil suits. It was held that the  agreement  dated\r\n15.02.1989 was executed between the plaintiff and defendant no. 2  for  sale\r\nof suit house; that the plaintiff was  not  placed  in  possession  of  suit\r\nhouse pursuant to agreement in question; that the plaintiff  was  not  ready\r\nand willing to perform her part of the agreement; that  suit  is  barred  by\r\nlimitation; that the plaintiff was not entitled  to  claim  the  relief  for\r\nspecific performance of agreement; that the plaintiff was  not  entitled  to\r\nclaim the relief for grant of permanent injunction; that defendant no. 1  is\r\na bona fide purchaser of the suit house for value;  that the  plaintiff  was\r\nnot entitled to challenge the sale deed dt. 9.2.1998, that the suit was  hit\r\nby the bar contained in Order II Rule 2 of CPC  because  the  plaintiff  did\r\nnot obtain leave to file second suit for specific performance  while  filing\r\nthe first suit for grant of permanent injunction against the  defendants  in\r\nrelation to the suit house.\r\n18.   Feeling aggrieved, the  plaintiff  filed  two  regular  first  appeals\r\nbeing R.F.A. Nos. 1092 of 2009 and 1094 of 2009 before the  High  Court.  By\r\ncommon impugned judgment/decree, the High Court allowed  both  the  appeals,\r\nreversed the judgment/decree of the trial court and decreed both  the  civil\r\nsuits by passing a decree for specific performance of agreement against  the\r\ndefendants in relation to suit house and also  issued  permanent  injunction\r\nas claimed by the plaintiff. The High Court answered all the  aforementioned\r\nissues in plaintiff\'s favour and against the defendants.\r\n19.   The High Court  in  its  judgment  held  that  the  plaintiff  was  in\r\npossession of suit house; that the  plaintiff  performed  her  part  of  the\r\nagreement; that the plaintiff paid the  entire  sale  consideration  of  Rs.\r\n3,50,000/- to defendant no. 2; that the plaintiff was ready and  willing  to\r\nperform her part of agreement; that defendant no. 2 failed  to  perform  her\r\npart of the agreement thereby rendering her liable to perform  her  part  of\r\nagreement; and that subsequent sale even if  made  by  defendant  no.  2  in\r\nfavour of defendant no. 1 was not binding on the plaintiff  because  it  was\r\nnot bona fide.\r\n20.   The High Court, however, after deciding the issues in  favour  of  the\r\nplaintiff, directed that in order to weigh the equities between the  parties\r\nand keeping in view the price escalation, which is  unavoidable  in  present\r\ndays, the plaintiff will pay an additional sum of Rs. 4 lacs over and  above\r\nRs. 3,50,000/- to defendant no. 2 for obtaining sale deed in her favour.\r\n\r\n 21.  It is against this judgment/decree of the High Court,  the  defendants\r\nhave filed the present appeals by way of special leave petitions.\r\n22.   Mrs. Nalini Chidambaram, learned  Senior  Counsel  appearing  for  the\r\nappellants (defendants) while assailing the legality and correctness of  the\r\nimpugned judgment urged various submissions. Firstly, she  argued  that  the\r\nHigh Court erred in allowing plaintiff\'s  first  appeals,  as  according  to\r\nher, both the appeals were liable to be dismissed by upholding the  judgment\r\n/decree of the trial court which had rightly dismissed the suits.  Secondly,\r\nshe argued that second suit filed for claiming specific performance  of  the\r\nagreement for sale of suit house to the plaintiff was hit by  bar  contained\r\nin Order II Rule 2 of CPC for  the  reason  that  the  plaintiff  failed  to\r\nsecure leave in her first suit and  hence  the  second  suit  filed  by  the\r\nplaintiff for grant of specific performance was not  maintainable.  Thirdly,\r\nshe argued that assuming the second suit was held  maintainable,  even  then\r\nit was barred by limitation prescribed in Article 54 of the Limitation  Act.\r\nIt was  pointed  out  that  cause  of  action  to  file  suit  for  specific\r\nperformance of contract against  the  defendants  arose  in  the  year  1989\r\nitself no sooner 60 days period  expired  from  the  date  of  agreement  as\r\nprovided in clause 2  of  the  agreement,  whereas,  the  suit  in  question\r\nseeking specific performance was filed  in  year  2000  and  hence,  it  was\r\nhopelessly  barred  applying  the  limitation  prescribed  in  Article   54.\r\nFourthly, it was argued that in any case, there was  no  case  made  out  on\r\nevidence by the plaintiff for reversal of the findings relating to grant  of\r\nspecific performance of agreement because the plaintiff  was  neither  ready\r\nnor willing to perform her part of the  agreement  and  nor  there  was  any\r\nevidence to hold in her favour on this material issue. Fifthly,  she  argued\r\nthat there was no evidence to hold that the plaintiff was in  possession  of\r\nthe suit house; rather there was enough evidence to hold that after sale  of\r\nsuit house by defendant no.2 to defendant no.1, it was defendant  no.1,  who\r\nwas in possession. Therefore, it should have been held  that  the  plaintiff\r\nwas not in possession of the suit house, as was rightly held  by  the  trial\r\ncourt. And, lastly she argued that it should have been held with the aid  of\r\nevidence that defendant no. 1 was bona fide purchaser of the suit house  for\r\nvalue, as she purchased it after the owner i.e. defendant  no.  2  cancelled\r\nthe agreement dt 15.2.1989 and then sold the suit house to defendant no.  1.\r\n\r\n23.   After arguing  at  length  with  reference  to  documents  on  record,\r\nlearned counsel for the appellants contended that impugned judgment  /decree\r\ndeserves to be set aside  and  that  of  the  trial  court  be  restored  by\r\ndismissing both the suits filed  by  the  plaintiff.  Learned  counsel  also\r\nrelied upon certain decisions, which we shall refer later.\r\n24.   Mr. P. Vishwanatha Shetty, learned senior counsel for  the  respondent\r\n(plaintiff) supported the impugned judgment /decree and  contended  that  it\r\ndoes not call for any interference. According  to  learned  senior  counsel,\r\nall the findings recorded by the High Court, though of reversal, deserve  to\r\nbe upheld because the High Court, in exercise of its first appellate  powers\r\nunder Section 96 of CPC, rightly appreciated the evidence and  came  to  its\r\nindependent conclusion which it could legally do and which  it  rightly  did\r\nwhile allowing the two first appeals.  Learned  senior  counsel  urged  that\r\nthis Court  while  hearing  these  appeals  cannot  and  rather  should  not\r\nundertake the exercise of appreciating the whole evidence  again  like  that\r\nof the first appeal except to find out whether there is any  apparent  legal\r\nerror in the impugned judgment so as to call for any  interference  by  this\r\nCourt. Learned senior counsel submitted that no such  error  exists  in  the\r\nimpugned judgment and hence these appeals are liable to be dismissed.\r\n25.   Having heard the learned counsel for the parties at  length  and  upon\r\nperusal of the record of the case, we find no merit in these appeals  as  in\r\nour considered opinion, the submissions urged by the learned senior  counsel\r\nfor the appellants, though argued ably, have no force.\r\n26.   Coming first to the legal question as  to  whether  bar  contained  in\r\nOrder II Rule 2 of CPC is attracted so as to non- suit  the  plaintiff  from\r\nfiling  the  suit  for  specific  performance  of  the  agreement,  in   our\r\nconsidered opinion, the bar is not attracted\r\n27.   At the outset, we consider it apposite to take note of law  laid  down\r\nby the Constitution bench of this Court in Gurbux Singh  v.  Bhooralal,  AIR\r\n1964 SC 1810, wherein this Court while explaining the true  scope  of  Order\r\nII Rule  2  of  CPC  laid  down  the  parameters  as  to  how  and  in  what\r\ncircumstances, a plea should be  invoked  against  the  plaintiff.   Justice\r\nAyyangar speaking for the Bench held as under:\r\n   In order that a plea of a  bar  under  Order  2  Rule  2(3)  of  the  Civil\r\nProcedure Code should succeed the defendant who raises the  plea  must  make\r\nout (1) that the second suit was in respect of the same cause of  action  as\r\nthat on which the previous suit was based;  (2)  that  in  respect  of  that\r\ncause of action the plaintiff was entitled to more than one relief;  (3)that\r\nbeing thus entitled to more than one relief  the  plaintiff,  without  leave\r\nobtained from the Court omitted to sue for the relief for which  the  second\r\nsuit had been filed. From this analysis it would be seen that the  defendant\r\nwould have to establish primarily and to start with, the  precise  cause  of\r\naction upon which the previous suit was filed, for unless there is  identity\r\nbetween the cause of action on which the earlier suit was filed and that  on\r\nwhich the claim in the later suit is based there would be no scope  for  the\r\napplication of the bar      \r\n                                   (Emphasis supplied)\r\n\r\n28.   This Court has consistently followed the aforesaid enunciation of  law\r\nin later years and reference to only one of such recent decisions  in  Virgo\r\nIndustries (Eng.) P. Ltd. Vs Venturetech Solutions P.  Ltd.,  (2013)  1  SCC\r\n625, would suffice, wherein this Court reiterated the principle  of  law  in\r\nfollowing words:\r\n   The cardinal requirement for application of  the  provisions  contained  in\r\nOrder II Rules 2(2) and (3), therefore, is that the cause of action  in  the\r\nlater suit must be the same  as  in  the  first  suit.  It  will  be  wholly\r\nunnecessary to enter into any discourse on the  true  meaning  of  the  said\r\nexpression, i.e. cause  of  action,  particularly,  in  view  of  the  clear\r\nenunciation in a recent judgment of this  Court  in  the  Church  of  Christ\r\nCharitable Trust and Educational  Charitable  Society,  represented  by  its\r\nChairman   v.   Ponniamman   Educational   Trust    represented    by    its\r\nChairperson/Managing Trustee  JT  2012  (6)  SC  149.  The  huge  number  of\r\nopinions  rendered  on  the  issue  including  the  judicial  pronouncements\r\navailable does not fundamentally detract from what is stated  in  Halsbury\'s\r\nLaws of England, (4th Edition). The following reference from the above  work\r\nwould, therefore, be apt for being extracted herein below:\r\n\r\n       Cause of Action    has been defined as meaning simply a  factual  situation\r\nexistence of which entitles one person to obtain from  the  Court  a  remedy\r\nagainst another person. The phrase has been held from the earliest  time  to\r\ninclude every fact which is material to be proved to entitle  the  Plaintiff\r\nto succeed, and  every  fact  which  a  Defendant  would  have  a  right  to\r\ntraverse. \'Cause of action    has also been  taken  to  mean  that  particular\r\naction on the part of the Defendant which gives the Plaintiff his  cause  of\r\ncomplaint, or the subject-matter  of  grievance  founding  the  action,  not\r\nmerely the technical cause of action.   \r\n\r\n29.   In the instant case when we apply  the  aforementioned  principle,  we\r\nfind that bar contained in Order II Rule 2 is not attracted because  of  the\r\ndistinction in the cause of action for filing the two suits. So far  as  the\r\nsuit for permanent injunction is concerned, it was based on a  threat  given\r\nto the plaintiff by the defendants to dispossess her from the suit house  on\r\n2.1.2000 and 9.1.2000. This would be clear  from  reading  Para  17  of  the\r\nplaint. So far as cause of action to file suit for specific  performance  of\r\nagreement is concerned, the same was based on non performance  of  agreement\r\ndated 15.2.1989 by defendant no. 2  in  plaintiff\'s  favour  despite  giving\r\nlegal notice dated 6.3.2000 to defendant no. 2 to perform her part.\r\n30.   In our considered opinion, both the suits were, therefore, founded  on\r\ndifferent causes of action and hence could be filed  simultaneously.  Indeed\r\neven  the  ingredients  to  file  the  suit  for  permanent  injunction  are\r\ndifferent than that of the suit for specific performance of agreement\r\n31.   In case of former, plaintiff is required to make out the existence  of\r\nprima facie case, balance of convenience and irreparable loss likely  to  be\r\nsuffered by the plaintiff on facts with reference to the  suit  property  as\r\nprovided in Section 38 of the Specific  Relief  Act,  1963  (in  short     the\r\nAct   ) read with Order 39 Rule 1 &amp; 2 of CPC. Whereas, in case of  the  later,\r\nplaintiff is required to  plead  and  prove  her  continuous  readiness  and\r\nwillingness to perform her part of  agreement  and  to  further  prove  that\r\ndefendant failed to perform her  part  of  the  agreement  as  contained  in\r\nSection 16 of The Act.\r\n32.   One of the basic requirements for successfully invoking  the  plea  of\r\nOrder II Rule 2 of CPC is that the defendant of  the  second  suit  must  be\r\nable to show that the second suit was also in respect of the same  cause  of\r\naction as that on which the previous suit was based.\r\n33.   As mentioned supra, since in the case on hand, this basic  requirement\r\nin relation to cause of action is not made out, the  defendants  (appellants\r\nherein) are not entitled to raise a plea of bar contained in Order  II  Rule\r\n2 of CPC to successfully non suit the plaintiff from  prosecuting  her  suit\r\nfor specific performance of the agreement against the defendants.\r\n 34.  Indeed when the cause of action to claim the respective  reliefs  were\r\ndifferent so also the ingredients for  claiming  the  reliefs,  we  fail  to\r\nappreciate as to how a plea of Order II  Rule  2  could  be  allowed  to  be\r\nraised by the defendants and how it was sustainable on such facts.\r\n 35.  We cannot accept the submission of  learned  senior  counsel  for  the\r\nappellants when she contended that  since  both  the  suits  were  based  on\r\nidentical pleadings and when cause of action to sue for relief  of  specific\r\nperformance of agreement was available to the plaintiff prior to  filing  of\r\nthe first suit, the second suit was hit by bar contained in Order II Rule  2\r\nof CPC.\r\n36.   The submission has a fallacy for two basic reasons. Firstly,  as  held\r\nabove, cause of action in two suits being different,  a  suit  for  specific\r\nperformance could not have been instituted on the basis of cause  of  action\r\nof the first The question arises for consideration in these appeals is whether the High Court was justified in allowing the first appeals preferred by the plaintiff, resulting in decreeing the two civil suits against defendants in relation to suit house?- In order to appreciate the controversy involved in the civil suits, and now in these appeals, it was necessary to state the relevant facts- The dispute relates to a dwelling house -The suit house was purchased by defendant no. 2 from Bangalore Development Authority (in short BDA) in a scheme- Defendant no. 2 entered into an agreement with plaintiff for sale of suit house at a total consideration of Rs. 3,50,000/-- In terms of clause 2 of the agreement, the plaintiff paid a sum of Rs. 50,000/- as advance towards sale consideration-These facts are not in dispute- the plaintiff filed a civil suit being For injuction-Though this litigation was not between inter se owner and subsequent purchaser of the suit house yet in order to do substantial justice between the parties and to see the end of this long litigation and to prevent a fresh suit being instituted by defendant no.1 against defendant no.2 for refund of sale consideration which will again take years to decide and lastly when neither it involve any intricate adjudication of facts, nor it is going to cause any prejudice to the parties, we consider it just and proper to invoke our power under Article 142 of the Constitution of India in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case as narrated above and accordingly direct defendant no. 2 (owner of the suit house) to refund Rs. 4 lacs to defendant no. 1 within three months after execution of sale deed by them in favour of plaintiff pursuant to the impugned judgment/decree- failure to refund the amount within three months, would carry interest at the rate of 9% payable on the unpaid amount from the date of this order till recovery and defendant no. 1, in the event of non-payment by defendant no. 2, would be entitled to levy execution against defendant no. 2 for realization of outstanding money along with interest as awarded treating this order to be a decree in appropriate executing court in accordance with law- Held- These appeals were accordingly disposed of-  No costs. Disposed off','Ranjana Vs State Of Maharashtra &amp; Ors      This appeal arises out of the judgment and order, dated 28th\n\nNovember, 2002, in Writ Petition No. 5058 of 2002, delivered by a\n\nDivision Bench of the High Court of Judicature of Bombay at\n\nAurangabad. By the impugned order, the High Court has dismissed\n\nappellant&apos;s petition questioning the correctness of the orders passed\n\nby the Caste Scrutiny Committee, which had invalidated the claim of\n\nthe appellant as belonging to the \"Mahar\" caste, finally resulting in\n\nher disqualification as a Member of the Zilla Parishad, Aurangabad.\n\n     In order to appreciate the issue, requiring determination, a few\n\nmaterial facts may be stated:\n\n     The appellant was born on 29th May, 1976 to Namdeo Nathaiji\n\nBagul and Zalabai Bagul, a farmer \"Mahar\" family. On 22nd April,\n1996, she married Babasaheb Nana Sature, a resident of Village\n\nJategaon according to \"Boudh\" rites.\n\n     In January, 2002, elections to the Zilla Parishad, Aurangabad\n\nwere announced and in the said election, the Constituency of\n\n&apos;10-Mahalgaon Circle&apos; was reserved for a Scheduled Caste citizen.\n\nOn 31st January, 2002, the appellant approached the Sub-Divisional\n\nOfficer, Vaijapur and obtained a Caste Certificate declaring that she\n\nbelonged to \"Mahar\" caste, a listed Scheduled Caste in the\n\nConstitution (Schedule Castes) Order, 1950 for the State of\n\nMaharashtra. On the basis of her Caste Certificate, the appellant\n\nfiled the nomination form as a candidate of the Shiv Sena Party to\n\ncontest for the 10-Mahalgaon Circle Seat. On 18th February, 2002,\n\nthe appellant was declared elected.\n\n     On 5th March, 2002, a complaint was lodged before the District\n\nCollector, Aurangabad by Smt. Kavita Anna Bagul, one of the\n\ndefeated candidates, alleging that the appellant was disqualified to\n\ncontest the elections as a Scheduled Caste candidate because she\n\nwas born in a Christian family and professed Christianity. On 14th\n\nMarch, 2002, another complaint on the same lines was filed by\n\nRamesh Khandagale, General Secretary, Republican Party of India.\n\n     The Collector     referred   appellant&apos;s   caste   certificate   for\n\nvalidation to the Caste Scrutiny Committee (\"the Committee\", for\n\n\n\n \nshort), which in turn got a vigilance inquiry conducted. After the\n\nsubmission of the vigilance report, the appellant filed her defence\n\nstatement. To substantiate their respective claims before the\n\nCommittee,    the   appellant   and   the   complainants    adduced\n\ndocumentary and oral evidence. The Committee by a majority view\n\nof 2 : 1, vide its order dated 25th October, 2002/18th November, 2002\n\nreturned the finding that though the appellant was born in a \"Mahar\"\n\ncaste, but her family professed Christianity inasmuch as the\n\nappellant was baptized on 27th October, 1977, when she was one\n\nyear old; she was married in a Christian family and her contention\n\nthat she had embraced Buddhism on 23rd August, 1988 was not\n\nestablished. Thus, her claim that she belonged to \"Mahar\" caste (a\n\nScheduled Caste) was rejected.\n\n     Aggrieved by the order of the Committee, the appellant\n\npreferred a writ petition in the High Court, challenging the\n\ncorrectness of the findings of the Committee. It was pleaded on\n\nbehalf of the appellant that she was born in a \"Hindu Mahar\" family;\n\nher school record shows that she was a Hindu; later on she\n\nembraced Buddhism on 23rd August, 1988; there was no Baptism\n\nceremony on 27th October, 1977 and that her marriage as also of\n\nher brothers and sisters were solemnised as per Boudh traditions.\n\n\n\n\n \n     Tracing the origin of \"Mahars\", one of the socially backward\n\nclasses in Rural Maharashtra, the High Court noted the factum of\n\nlarge scale conversions of socially backward classes in the rural\n\nareas of Maharashtra to Christianity. The High Court also noticed\n\nthe amendment carried out in the Constitution (Scheduled Castes)\n\nOrder, 1950, by the Act No.15 of 1999, whereby and whereunder\n\nthe persons who had converted themselves to \"Buddhism\" were\n\nheld eligible for the benefit of reservation as available to the\n\nScheduled Castes from 1999 onwards. Taking into consideration the\n\nevidence on record, including the entries in the Baptism Register,\n\nthe High Court observed thus:\n\n     \"Reading the Baptism register and the entries thereof in\n     respect of the petitioner on 27.10.1977, with the\n     provisions of Canon Law as reproduced hereinabove, we\n     have no doubt in our mind that the petitioner&apos;s parents\n     professed Christianity when the petitioner was baptised at\n     the age of one year and she was born to Christian\n     parents. It is obvious that the petitioner&apos;s parents continue\n     with their caste identity namely \"Mahar caste\" but that by\n     itself would not be sufficient to hold that the petitioner did\n     not Profess Christianity and she was all along a \"Mahar\n     Hindu / Buddhist\".\n\n     In so far as the stand of the appellant that she had embraced\n\nBuddhism on her marriage is concerned, the High Court observed\n\nas under:\n\n           \"It appears that the petitioner was aware of the legal\n     position, namely: on reconversion to Buddhism or\n     Hinduism she can enter into the fold of Scheduled Castes\n     and she took the plea regarding her reconversion to\n\n \n     Buddhism. In support of this defence, she relied on the\n     certificate purportedly issued by Bhadant. This Dhamma\n     Dhiksha Certificate is purportedly dated 23.8.2002 by the\n     said Bhadant. The Committee had issued a notice calling\n     upon the said person to appear before it. In spite of receipt\n     of the notice, the said Bhadant did not appear before the\n     Committee on 30.8.2002. T  Civil  - Validity of Order - Dismissal of Appellant\'s request of scrutinizing the accuracy of the requests go by the Caste Scrutiny Committee, which had negated the claim of the Appellant as having a place with the \"Mahar\" position - Hence Appeal \r\n\r\nHeld, Finding of the Committee that the Appellant is not a Scheduled Caste, being basically a finding of actuality, it is not a fit case for exercise of ward under Article 136 of the Constitution - Though the High Court has found the section with respect to Appellant\'s Baptism to have been made in the typical course of Baptism, however the passage does not fundamentally demonstrate the way that her folks had likewise changed over to Christianity - Matter remanded [para 12, 14] ','Noor Salman Makani Vs Union Of India (Jayachandra The Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nK.  JAYACHANDRA REDDY, J.- Leave granted in SLP	 (Crl.)	 No.\n1484 of 1993.\n2.   In	 both  these  matters, Noor  Salman  Makani  who  is\ndetained  under Section 3 of the COFEPOSA Act,	1974  (&apos;Act&apos;\nfor  short) is the petitioner.	The petitioner is a  citizen\nof  India.   On	 August	 26, 1992  he  was  travelling	from\nCalcutta  to Hong Kong by Thai International Airways  Flight\nNo. TC314.  After completing the immigration formalities, he\napproached  the Customs counter for clearance.	The  Customs\nauthorities   opened  his  briefcase  and   recovered	huge\nquantities  of	foreign exchange of various  countries,	 the\nvalue of which is estimated at Rs 38,06,930.  On August	 27,\n1992  he was produced under arrest before the  CJM,  Barasat\nand his application for bail was rejected.  On September 19,\n1992 an order of detention dated September\n \n18,  1992  was	served on him in the  jail  along  with	 the\ngrounds	 of  detention.	 On October 1,	1992  a	 declaration\nunder  Section 9(1) of the Act was issued and the  same	 was\nserved	on the detenu on October 13, 1992.  On	October	 15,\n1992  the  petitioner made a representation to	the  Central\nGovernment   against  the  declaration	but  the  same	 was\nrejected.   On	December  28, 1992  the	 petitioner  made  a\nrepresentation	before the Advisory Board but that was	also\nrejected.  Thereafter he filed a writ of habeas corpus and a\nDivision  Bench	 of the Calcutta High  Court  dismissed	 the\nsame.	As against the said order the present SLP  in  which\nleave is granted, has been filed.  A separate Writ  Petition\n(Crl.)	No.  261 of 1993 questioning the  declaration  under\nSection	 9(1)  of the Act has also been filed  stating	that\ncertain	 new facts have come to light which  invalidate	 the\ndeclaration.   The  detention  order is	 questioned  on	 the\nground	 that	there	was   delay   in   considering	 the\nrepresentation	and  also on the ground that  the  detaining\nauthority has not duly considered the circumstance that	 the\ndetenu	was  already  in jail and has  simply  made  a	bald\nstatement in the grounds stating that \"there is	 possibility\nof  the	 detenu being released on bail\" and the	 same  shows\nthat there is non-application of mind.\n3.   From the records it appears that the representation  of\nthe  detenu addressed to the Joint Secretary, COFEPOSA,	 New\nDelhi was forwarded by Dum Dum Central Jail authority  under\nregistered  post on October 15, 1992 and it was received  by\nthe  Ministry&apos;s	 Office	 on  October 22,  1992	and  it	 was\nforwarded  to  the Sponsoring Unit on October 23,  1992	 who\nreceived  it on October 26, 1992.  After  offering  parawise\ncomments  the same was sent by speed post to the  Ministry&apos;s\nOffice	on  October  29,  1992 which  was  received  by	 the\nMinistry&apos;s  Office on November 2, 1992.	 The  representation\nwas  put up before the Joint Secretary on November  3,	1992\nand the same was rejected on November 4, 1992.	The  Finance\nSecretary recommended the rejection of the representation on\nNovember  5,  1992  and finally	 the  Minister	for  Finance\nrejected the same on the same day and a memo dated  November\n6,  1992 was issued to the petitioner intimating  him  about\nthe rejection.\n4.   Learned  counsel appearing for the	 petitioner  submits\nthat the delay between October 15, 1992 and November 2, 1992\nhas  not  been satisfactorily explained and hence  is  fatal\nbeing violative of Article 22(5) of the Constitution.  It is\nalso  his submission that the delay of every day has  to  be\nexplained  as held by the courts.  He relied on some of	 the\njudgments of this Court including Rama Dhondu Borade v. V.K.\nSaraf,	Commissioner of Police&apos;.  There is no doubt that  in\nmany  cases  this Court has reiterated that  the  right	 and\nobligation to make and to consider the representation at the\nearliest  opportunity is a constitutional  imperative  which\ncannot	be curtailed or abridged but in considering  whether\nthere  was  undue and unexplained delay, the facts  in	each\ncase have to be examined.  In Rama Dhondu Borade case&apos;	this\nCourt observed thus: (SCC p. 180, para 20)\n	      \"True,  there is no prescribed  period  either\n	      under  the provisions of the  Constitution  or\n	      under the concerned detention law within which\n	      the\n	      1	 (1989) 3 SCC 173: 1989 SCC (Cri)  520:	 AIR\n	      1989 SC 1861\n \n	      representation should be dealt with.  The	 use\n	      of the words &apos;as soon as may be&apos; occurring  in\n	      Article  22(5)  of the  Constitution  reflects\n	      that    the    representation    should	  be\n	      expeditiously considered and disposed of	with\n	      due promptitude and diligence and with a sense\n	      of urgency and without avoidable delay.	What\n	      is  reasonable dispatch depends on  the  facts\n	      and circumstances of each case and no hard and\n	      fast  rule  can be laid down in  that  regard.\n	      However,	in case the gap between the  receipt\n	      of the representation and its consideration by\n	      the authority is so unreasonably long and	 the\n	      explanation  offered  by the authority  is  so\n	      unsatisfactory,  such delay could vitiate	 the\n	      order of detention.\"\nIn  the above case the gap between receipt and	disposal  of\nthe representation was 28 days but up to the date of service\nof the order of rejection, the delay amounted to 32 days and\nthe court was not satisfied with the explanation offered and\nit was only after a delay of 14 days that the representation\nwas disposed of and the only explanation was that some	more\ninformation  was  called  for and that	there  were  certain\nholidays  in  between.	The Court held that  the  delay	 was\nunreasonable   and  the	 explanation   was   unsatisfactory.\nRelying	 on these observations, the learned counsel  submits\nthat in the instant case the period between October 15, 1992\nand  October  22,  1992 and between  October  23,  1992	 and\nNovember  2, 1992 amounted to undue and	 unexplained  delay.\nBut  if	 we  examine  the facts it  can	 be  seen  that	 the\nrepresentation	was forwarded by the Jail Superintendent  on\nOctober	 15,  1992 itself by registered post  but  that	 was\nreceived  on October 22, 1992 by the Ministry&apos;s	 Office	 and\nthe  entire delay was due to the delay in  postal  delivery.\nTherefore  the	same cannot be said to be  unreasonable	 and\nunexplained.

','Sunil Vs State Of Maharashtra Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.\n\n\n\n1.      Leave granted.\n\n2.      Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a Division Bench of the\n\nBombay High Court, Aurangabad Bench dismissing the appeals filed by\n\nseveral accused persons. The present appeal is by original accused No. 6\n\n\n\n\n \n(hereinafter referred to as the A6). He was convicted for various offences\n\npunishable under the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short the `IPC&apos;) and\n\nsentenced to undergo custodial imprisonment and fine with default\n\nstipulation. The High Court dismissed the appeal so far as the present\n\nappellant is concerned, we are not concerned with the other appeals.\n\n\n\n3.    Prosecution version in a nutshell is as follows:\n\n\n\n      A.S.I. Yadav Satpute(P.W. 11) who was attached to police station,\n\nPathardi and was on duty as a Police Station officer on 7.3.1998, received a\n\nphone call at about 2230 hrs. informing him that there was stone pelting at\n\nRangar Galli and, therefore, he sent the necessary police force. He made an\n\nentry at sr. no. 30 in the station diary and at about 10.45 p.m. sent a message\n\nto the Control Room and the other police stations. An entry in this behalf\n\nwas recorded in the station diary at sr. no. 32. Sanjay Shahane (P.W. 4)\n\ncame to the police station and A.S.I. Satpute (P.W. 11) recorded the report\n\nof&apos; Sanjay (P.W. 4) at Exh. 125. An entry in this behalf was accordingly\n\nmade in the station diary at sr. no.33. Sanjay Shahane (P.W. 4) immediately\n\nleft the police station on receiving message that his uncle Jaikumar (P.W. 2)\n\n\n\n\n \nhad become unconscious. Thereafter at about 2355 hrs., original accused\n\nNo.13 Pratibha came to the police station and gave a report in respect of a\n\nnon-cognizable offence. An entry in respect thereof was made in the station\n\ndiary at sr. no. 34. Original accused No.10 Amol and juvenile offender\n\nRama were referred to the hospital as they had sustained minor injuries. The\n\nXerox copy of the entries in the station diary are Exh. 156. A.P.I. Shinde\n\n(P.W. 12) who was also attached to Police Station, Pathardi took over the\n\ninvestigation of Crime No.33 of 1998 from A.S.I. P.W. 11 Satpute as the\n\ncrime had been registered on the basis of the first information report of\n\nSanjay Shahane (P.W.4). A.P.I. Shinde (P.W. 12) received a copy of the\n\nstatement of Digambar (P.W. 1). On 8.3.1998, A.P.I. Shinde accordingly\n\nvisited the mortuary and drew the inquest panchnama of the dead bodies of\n\nDhananjay and Santosh vide inquest panchnamas at Exhs. 116 and 117 in\n\nthe presence of witnesses. Thereafter on the same day he visited the scene of\n\nthe offence at about 9.30 A.M. and drew the scene of the offence\n\npanchnama at Exh. 111 in the presence of P.W. 1 Digambar. The scene of\n\nthe offence was pointed out by P.W. 4 Sanjay Shahane and the spot is a\n\nnarrow lane to the south of the main road of Pathardi. The narrow lane\n\nwhich is the scene of the offence is known as Rangar Galli. Deceased\n\n\n\n\n \nDhananjay had been killed in front of the house of one Pandurang Kasar\n\nwhile deceased Sanjay had been killed in front of the house of one\n\nBhagirath Bajaj. The lane was of a width of about 4 ft. with stone flooring.\n\nDried bloodstains were noticed in front of the house of Bhagirath Bajaj as\n\nwell as in front of the house of Pandurang Kasar. The distance between the\n\ntwo spots where the murder of deceased Sanjay and deceased Dhananjay\n\nhad been committed is at about 10 ft. The spot panchnama further records\n\nthat at a distance of 25 ft. house of one Vilas Rodi is situated and an electric\n\nbulb is affixed on the door of his house.

','Bhagwan Singh &amp; Ors Vs State Of M.P SETHI, J.\n\n	The appellants, alongwith two others, were charged under Sections 148, 302, 336, 337, 427 read\nwith Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code by the Court of Additional Sessions Judge, Burhanpur and after\ntrial acquitted by the trial court vide its judgment dated 24th June, 1987.  The appeal filed by the State\nagainst the order of acquittal was allowed by the High Court vide the judgment impugned convicting the\nappellants for offences under Section 302/149 and sentencing them to life imprisonment besides paying a\nfine of Rs.5,000/- each in default of which they have been directed to suffer further rigorous imprisonment\nfor one year each.  They were also convicted for the commission of offence under Section 148 IPC and\nsentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year each.\n\n	Not satisfied with the judgment of the High Court, the appellants have preferred this appeal under\nSection 379 of the Code of Criminal Procedure read with Order XXI Rules 12 to 29 of the Supreme Court\nRules, 1966.\n\n	According to the prosecution there was a dispute between Amarnath (deceased) and Ram Singh,\nappellant with respect to four mango trees grown on Khasra No.212 situated at Village Sarai.  Litigation\nwas pending between both the parties and police had registered several cases under Sections 147 and 145 of\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure.	 According to the FIR recorded on the statement of PW22 Jagdish that he\nalong with his family members was watching TV at his house.  Amarnath and Hari Ram were also there.\nWhen he was about to start his meals, they heard the cries of \"Bachao-Bachao\" (save-save) raised by\nSurender.  They saw all the 16 accused persons assaulting Surender with lathis, Dhariya, Khartaliya and\nPata.  When Hari Ram went to intervene, the accused attacked him.  Similarly when Amarnath went\nforward he was also assaulted.	Ram Singh instigated other accused persons to finish Amarnath saying that\nas he was responsible for everything, he should be finished today.  Thereafter Ram Singh, Bhagwan Singh,\nSardar Singh, Roop Singh and Dhyansingh attacked Amarnath with lethal weapons in their possession.\nWitness rushed forward to save his father and was also attacked by the aforesaid accused persons.  He ran\naway to the house to save himself.  The accused then threw stones on the house which broke roof tiles,\ndoors and also damaged the walls.  After registration of the FIR, the investigating officers sent the injured,\nnamely, Surender and Hari Ram to the District Hospital, Khandwa where they died the same night, the\ninformation of which was sent to the police by Hospital Authorities.  Mukesh was also found injured and\nsent for treatment to the hospital.  In the occurrence three persons, namely, Surender, Hari Ram and\nAmarnath were murdered and some of the witnesses injured.\n\n	The trial court acquitted the accused persons on finding that appellants Bhagwan Singh, Ram\nSingh, Roop Singh had received injuries and \"seeing danger of life and other accused utilised right of\nprivate defence and there aggressors died and rest aggressors fled away.  Hence the act of the accused fall\nwithin the definition of right of private defence u/s 100 IPC and their act is not punishable according to\nprovisions of section 96 IPC\".	The trial court further held, \"I find that prosecution failed to prove case\nbeyond reasonable doubts and accused committed murder of deceased Amarnath, Surender and Hariram\nand caused injuries to Mukesh witness and damaged house of Jagdish after throwing stones\". Holding that\nthe prosecution had failed to prove the offence against accused beyond all reasonable doubts and giving\nthem the benefit of right of self-defence, as contemplated under Section 100 IPC, he acquitted the accused\npersons.\n\n	The High Court rightly found that the trial court had been led astray by the simple fact that the\ninjuries on the person of the accused had not been explained by the prosecution witnesses.  After referring\nto number of judgments of this Court, the High Court concluded:\n\n\"In view of what we have discussed about the circumstances\nof the case, the injuries on the persons of the three\ndeceased, the sequence in which the witnesses reached the\nspot of crime, minor nature of the injuries on the persons\nof the accused except one injury on the head of Bhagwan\nSingh and the background and also the sequence in which the\ndeceased were attacked, rules out any possibility of the\naccused having attacked the three deceased in exercise of\nself-defence of any of them.  It is clear that the accused\npersons were the aggressors.\"\n\n\n	After critically and minutely examining the evidence on record,\nthe High Court found that the presence of eye-witnesses, namely, Kiran\n(PW7), Mukesh (PW12) and Jagdish (PW22) cannot be doubted.  In this\nregard the court held:\n\n\"A striking feature of this case is that one of the accused\nSardarsingh lodged a report Ex.D-5 at 11.30 p.m. that 4\npersons i.e. Amarnath, Jagdish, Surendra and Hariram were\nassaulting Bhagwansingh and Roopsingh.	Even here Jagdish\nwitness was shown present and there was no mention of\nRamsingh accused.  Then in cross examination to these three\neye-witnesses the suggestions have been that the deceased\nand the witnesses along with others assaulted the accused at\nthe house of Ramsingh.	The trial court has ignored this\ntrend of cross examination on behalf of the accused in\nappreciating whether the witnesses were present at the scene\nof violence.  In the facts and circumstances of a given\ncase, the trend of cross-examination by defence or\nprosecution witness can provide support to the inference if\nsome accused and witnesses were present at the scene of\ncrime.	The most striking feature is the fact that such a\nreport was recorded by the police and they at one proceeded\nto the scene of crime.	There is no mention in Ex.D-5 if any\nserious injury was given to Sardarsingh or Roopsing and\nwhether any weapon has been used or only fists blows were\nbeing exchanged.  Still the police rushed to the scene of\ncrime at the night.  This is rare.  This indicates that\nthere was some under current working between the police and\nthe accused persons.  The police could not but have recorded\nthe Dehati Nalishi on finding one person died and 2 in the\nprocess of dying with fatal injuries.  This is followed by\nlapse of the investigating officer in recorded statement of\nMukesh and Kiran after 7 days if Kiran had not witnesses the\noccurrence there was no need to introduce her as a witness\nwhen there were witnesses such as Jagdish and Mukesh whose\npresence at that spot could hardly be challenged.  So, if\nanything, investigation was unfair towards the complainant\nparty and not against the accused persons.\"\n\nand concluded:\n\n\"So we find the testimony of these witnesses, trustworthy\nand also confirmatory to each other.  Their presence is\nestablished at the scene of crime.  Their testimony is\ncorroborated by FIR and by medical evidence.\"\n\n	We do not agree with the submissions of the learned counsel for\nthe appellants that under Section 378 of the Code of Criminal Procedure\nthe High Court could not disturb the finding of facts of the trial court\neven if it found that the view taken by the trial court was not proper.\nOn the basis of the pronouncements of this Court, the settled position\nof law regarding the powers of the High Court in an appeal against an\norder of acquittal is that the Court has full powers to review the\nevidence upon which an order of acquittal is based and generally it will\nnot interfere with the order of acquittal because by passing an order of\nacquittal the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused is\nreinforced.  The golden thread which runs through the web of\nadministration of justice in criminal case is that if two views are\npossible on the evidence adduced in the case, one pointing to the guilt\nof the accused and the other to his innocence, the view which is\nfavourable to the accused should be adopted.  Such is not a jurisdiction\nlimitation on the appellate court but a Judge made guidelines for\ncircumspection.	 The paramount consideration of the court is to ensure\nthat miscarriage of justice is avoided.	 A miscarriage of justice which\nmay arise from the acquittal of guilty is no less than from the\nconviction of an innocent.  In a case where the trial court has taken a\nview ignoring the admissible evidence, a duty is cast upon the High\nCourt to reappreciate the evidence in acquittal appeal for the purposes\nof ascertaining as to whether all or any of the accused has committed\nany offence or not.  Probable view taken by the trial court which may\nnot be disturbed in the appeal is such a view which is based upon legal\nand admissible evidence.  In the instant case the trial court acquitted\nthe respondents by not re Code of Criminal Procedure - area 379 - Supreme Court Rules - Order XXI Rules 12 to 29 - advance under - Indian Penal Code - Sections 148, 302, 336, 337, 427 read with Section 149 - offenses under - conviction and sentence under the settled position of law in regards to the forces of the High Court in an interest against a request of quittance is that the court has full powers to survey the proof whereupon a request or vindication is based and for the most part it won\'t meddle with the request of absolution in light of the fact that by passing a request of exoneration the assumption guiltlessness for the denounced is strengthened - for a situation where the trial court has taken a view overlooking the allowable confirmation, an obligation is provided reason to feel ambiguous about the High Court to reappreciate the proof in quittance advance for the motivations behind learning concerning whether all or any of the charged has perpetrated any offense or not - the trial court wrongly held that the respondents were supported in bringing on the demise of three people in practice of their privilege of self-preservation - no legitimacy in offer - rejected. ','Sumatidevi M. Dhanwatay Vs Union Of India And Ors JUDGMENT\n\n2004(3) SCR 928\n\nThe following Judgment of the Court was delivered\n\nThe appellant travelled by 1st Class Air conditioned berth from Nagpur to\nBombay by Howrah-Bombay Mail. She was carrying her luggage which included\ngold, pearl, silver and diamond jewellery and other valuables valued at Rs.\n1,11,756. While she was travelling, she was assaulted by some unauthorised\npassengers and her gold, silver, pearl, diamond and other valuables were\ntaken away forcibly. This incident occurred on 4.12.1991. Thousands of\npersons entered into the compartment and assaulted the passengers,\nincluding the appellant. The said crowd was so violent that they broke the\ndoors, window bars, glass panels, seating berths and toilets etc. This\napart, the crowd committed so many other illegal acts of assaulting the\nbonafide passengers. They molested the women and even raped the young girl\npassengers. The appellant pulled the alarm chain three times, as a result\nof which, the train stopped at Igatpuri Station. She, alongwith other\nbonafide passengers got down at that station. She approached the Railway\nAuthorities for protection, but, without any assistance. On reaching\nBombay, she lodged a complaint with the police about the incident. The\nappellant approached the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission,\nMaharashtra State (hereinafter referred to as &apos;the State Commission&apos;, for\nshort) by filing a complaint claiming compensation of Rs. 9,32,256. The\nState Commission, after considering the material that was placed before it\nand on considering the rival contentions, allowed the claim of the\nappellant partly awarding total compensation of Rs. 1,41,756. The Railway\nadministration, aggrieved by and not satisfied with the said order, filed\nan appeal before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission\n(hereinafter referred to as &apos;the National Commission&apos;, for short). The\nNational Commission, by the order under challenge in this appeal, set aside\nthe order made by the State Commission. Hence this appeal.\n\nThe learned counsel for the appellant strongly contended that the National\nCommission was not right and justified on facts as well as in law in\nupsetting the order passed by the State Commission; the National Commission\nhas set aside the order made by the State Commission without dislodging the\nreasons given by the State Commission in allowing the claim made by the\nappellant; the National Commission has set aside the order of the State\nCommission simply stating that the State Commission was not right in\nupholding that there has been a deficiency in service on the part of the\nRailway administration. The learned counsel added that having regard to the\nfacts found, the State Commission was fully justified in ordering the\ncompensation.\n\nIn opposition, the learned counsel for the respondent Nos. 1 to 4 submitted\nthat the order impugned in this appeal is just and supportable order.\nAccording to her, the State Commission had no jurisdiction to entertain the\ncomplaint made by the appellant; there was no deficiency in service on the\npart of the Railway administration; when an unruly mob entered into the\nrailway compartment and caused damage on the person and property of the\npassengers, the Railway administration was helpless. In such a situation,\nno complaint could be entertained by the State Commission under the\nConsumer Protection Act, 1986.\n\nWe have considered the respective submissions made on behalf of the\nparties. As is evident from the order of the State Commission that opposite\nparties Nos 1, 3, 5 &amp; 6, i.e., Union of India, Chief Security\nCommissioner, Secretary, Home Department and Inspector General of Police,\nremained absent. No written version was filed by any of the parties on the\ndate given. The complaint was posted for final hearing on 14.9.1993, on\nwhich date the Union of India and the General Manager, Central Railway\nfiled written version jointly. The averment made in the complaint that the\nappellant travelled by train on that day when the incident happened, is\nadmitted. However, the Railway administration denied its responsibility as\nto the theft of luggage of the appellant and the injuries suffered by her.\nThe only contention of the Railway administration was that it was not\nresponsible for the toss of luggage and injuries caused to the appellant.\nThe State Commission, on consideration of the facts and circumstances, has\nrecorded that having regard to the past experience, the Railway\nadministration did not take reasonable steps to avoid such incident. It is\nalso recorded in the order of the State Commission that the allegations of\ninjuries suffered by the appellant and the loss caused to her luggage, the\nRailway administration had not been able to controvert effectively. It was\nsubmitted on behalf of the Railway administration before the State\nCommission that the claim as to the loss of ornaments urged by the\nappellant, was exaggerated. As&apos; regards loss of the Bank Draft, it was\ncontended that intimation could be given to the concerned Bank. An argument\nwas also advanced that the complaint was not maintainable under the\nprovisions of  Consumer Act- safety- Compansation- The appellant travelled by 1st Class Air conditioned berth from Nagpur to Bombay by Howrah-Bombay Mail- she was assaulted by some unauthorised passengers and her gold, silver, pearl, diamond and other valuables were taken away forcibly- They molested the women and even raped the young girl passengers. The appellant pulled the alarm chain three times, as a result of which, the train stopped at Igatpuri Station-She, alongwith other bonafide passengers got down at that station. She approached the Railway Authorities for protection, but, without any assistance- she lodged a complaint with the police about the incident. The appellant approached the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Maharashtra State by filing a complaint claiming compensation of Rs. 9,32,256- The State Commission, after considering the material that was placed before it and on considering the rival contentions, allowed the claim of the appellant partly awarding total compensation of Rs. 1,41,756- The Railway administration, aggrieved by and not satisfied with the said order, filed an appeal before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (hereinafter referred to as \'the National Commission\', for short). The National Commission, by the order under challenge in this appeal, set aside the order made by the State Commission. Hence this appeal-under Section 124A of the Railways Act, 1989, the Railway administration cannot escape the liability having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case and in the light of the incident that had taken place. As to the deficiency of service on the part of the Railway administration, no such plea was raised before the State Commission. The Railway administration also did not raise any issue as to the maintainability of the complaint or jurisdiction of the State Commission to deal with the complaint. Even otherwise, under Section 3 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, the complaint could be entertained by the State Commission in the absence of any such plea taken by the Railway administration as to the jurisdiction to entertain the complaint. This being the position, in our view, the impugned order passed by the National Commission cannot be sustained. No good reason was given by the National Commission to upset the order passed by the State Commission, as already observed. Under the circumstances, the appeal is entitled to succeed. Accordingly, it is allowed and the impugned order is set aside. The respondent-Railways shall pay Rs. 5000 to the appellant towards cost.

MOHAPATRA,J This appeal, filed by accused no.1 Babu Kuttan Ramkrishna Pillai and accused no.2 Umesh @ Babu Purshottam Bhatt of TADA ACT Spl.Case No.33 of 1994, is directed against the judgment and order dated 21.8.1998 of the Designated Court at Brihan `Mumbai under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 (for short TADA Act). In the said case seven accused persons faced trial under Section 120-B read with 307 r/w 34, 307 r/w 114, 307 r/w 149, 387 r/w 34, 143, 144, 147, 148 and 506 (ii), 353 r/w 114 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 3(2)(ii), 3(3), 3(5), 5 and 6 of the TADA Act and section r/w 25(IB)\r\n\r\n(a), Section 5 r/w 27 of the Arms Act. The gist of the prosecution case relevant for the purpose of this proceeding may be stated thus: With the growth of industry, commerce and trade in and around the city of Mumbai which generates substantial quantity of wealth, there has been increase of organised activities by gangs of anti-socials to extract money from affluent sections of society like developers, hoteliers and other businessmen by putting them in fear of death and then to demand substantial sums of money commonly known as &quot;Khadani&quot; i.e. protection money. One such gang was operating in the city under Amar Naik @ Bhai, who died a couple of years before the decision in the case at an encounter with the police. The prosecution alleged that in pursuance of a criminal conspiracy between 15.1.1994 to 16.5.1994 the accused persons and others of the gang embarked upon preparatory acts like procuring the information about the names of the builders of M/s Kalpataru Construction Company which was engaged in developing a property at Pali Hill, named Nakshatra Building. PW-7 Sudhir Tambe was the Senior Vice-President of the company with its head office at Nariman Point. He used to sit in the head- office. PW 6 Pachapur, Civil Engineer, was an employee of the company who used to remain at the site to supervise the construction. As the prosecution story runs, on 15.4.1994 between 11.30 a.m. and 12.00 noon while PW 6 was on duty at the construction site, accused no.3, Nitin Vasant Venugurlekar armed with revolver and accused No.4 Rajindera @ Rajan Mahadeo Margaj armed with a chopper and accused no.5 Jayendra @ Jai Anandrao Jadhav also armed with a chopper visited the site of Nakshatra Building; they threatened the workers at the site, forcibly brought PW 6 Pachapur in a room on the ground floor and man-handled him. Accused no.3, pointing a revolver at him demanded the name, address and telephone number of the builders. PW 6 disclosed the name of PW 7 Tambe and gave his telephone number to them. The accused then asked him to go to the office of the builders at Nariman Point and make the arrangement for a telephonic talk with Tambe. PW 6 rushed to the office and told Tambe of what had happened at the construction site. This was followed by telephonic calls from the accused who wanted to speak to Tambe. Attempts were made by PW 6 and PW 7 to avoid any discussion with the gangsters. Two or three days thereafter when the accused got Tambe on the telephone he (Tambe) gave them some other telephone numbers and asked them to contact those persons including one D.N.Ghosh, the Security Contractor. Eight/ten days thereafter again a telephone call was made to the office of Tambe which was received by PW 6 who was informed by the person making the call that they could not get D. N. Ghosh on the telephone numbers furnished by Tambe. Thereafter PW 6 handed over the receiver to Tambe. This incident was followed by several threats given by the gangsters to workers and also repeated telephone calls made to the Head Office of the company to contact Tambe. The staff of the site office absented from work resulting in virtual closure of construction activity. On 11.5.1994 the deceased Sanjay Patil telephoned to Tambe and warned him that he is wasting time and should meet him without further delay. After some days there was one more similar call from Sanjay Patil and he asked Tambe that he should talk to Bhai and saying so he handed over the receiver to another person who gave his identity as Amar Naik (since deceased), who told Tambe that he should pay Rs.10 lacs. The later pleaded his inability to pay such a heavy sum and after some discussion agreed to pay Rs.5 lacs. He was asked to come to Nakshatra Building site on 16.5.1994 along with money. In the meantime Tambe informed all the happenings to the Addl. Commissioner of Police Mr.Sanjeev Dayal and the then Dy. Commissioner of Police of Zone VII Mr. Rajanish Sheth within whose jurisdiction Khar Police Station fell.\r\n\r\nOn 16.5.1994 at about 12.00 noon the deceased Sanjay Patil telephoned Tambe and inquired from him as to what he was going to do about the payment and then Tambe replied that he will be leaving office at about 2.00 p.m. for Pali Hill. Sanjay Patil cautioned him that he should not make any haste and he should wait for his call so that he will take necessary instructions from his boss i.e. Amar Naik.

The	petitioner  is	diploma-  holder  in\nEngineering  and holds the post of Executive Engineer in the\nrespondent-Corporation. Till 1974, the promotion post of the\nsuperintending Engineer	 was  available	 both  for  diploma-\nholders and degree-holders according to merit-cum-seniority.\nThis was  so according	to  the	 practice  followed  by	 the\nCorporation without  making any	 rules or regulation in that\nbehalf. In  1974, the corporation made regulation by passing\na resolution  by passing a resolution and continued the same\npractice. Admittedly,  the regulation  were not	 made  under\nsection 64  of the  Maharashtra Industrial  Development Act,\n1961 [hereinafter  referred to as the &apos;Act&apos;] under which the\nrespondent-corporation was  created. Thereafter in 1988, the\ncorporation passed a resolution, for the first time,. making\n75 per	cent of	   the	posts  of  superintending  engineers\navailable to  the executive Engineers holding degrees and 25\nper cent  to  the  Executive  Engineers	 who  were  diploma-\nholders.  This	 resolution  was   also	 admittedly   not  a\nregulation made	 under the   said  section 64.	But for this\nresolution, the	 petitioner who was senior to respondent NO.\n2 would	 have been  promoted to	 the post  of Superintending\nEngineer on  31st October,  1990. However,  since respondent\nNo.2 was a degree holder, he got the said resolution and was\npromoted to the said post on that date. It is this promotion\nwhich was challenged by the petitioner by a writ petition in\nthe High  Court. The  High Court  by the  impugned  judgment\ndismissed the said petition.\n     2.	 Two   contentions  were  raised\n     before us.\n     (i) that no classification could be\n     made among	 the Executive Engineers\n     on the  basis of  their educational\n     qualification for	the  purpose  of\n     promotion	 to    the    post    of\n     superintending Engineer, since they\n     belong  to	  the  same   cadre   of\n     Executive Engineers and do the same\n     work.  There   was	 also  a  common\n     seniority	  of	the    Executive\n     Engineers	maintained.   hence  the\n     classification  was  discriminatory\n     in nature and violative of Articles\n     14 and 16 of the Constitution .\n     (ii)  that	  if  at   all	such   a\n     discrimination was	 permissible, it\n     could be  made only  be a statutory\n     rule  or  regulation  framed  under\n     Section 64	 of the said Act. A mere\n     resolution	   or	 an    executive\n     instruction could	not effect  such\n     discrimination.\n3.   We find  not merit in either of the two contentions. It\nis now	well settled  that for	the purpose  of promotion, a\nvalid classification  can made among the members holding the\nsame post  on the  basis of their qualification. In state of\nJummu &amp;	 Kashmir v.  Triloki Nath Khosa &amp; Ors., [1974] 1 SCR\n771, a Constitution Bench of his court has clearly held that\nsuch a	classification is  permissible and  does not violate\nArticles 14  and  16  of  the  Constitution  the  Court	 has\nobserved there that in state of Mysore &amp; Anr. v. P. Narasing\nRao, [1968]  1 SCR  407 and The Union of India and others v.\nDr.(Mrs.) S.B.	Kholi, AIR  1973 SC 811, it was already held\nthat   classification	 on   the   basis   of	 educational\nqualification was  permissible. The  Court then	 referred to\nRoshan Lal  Tandon v.  Union of India, [1968] 1 SCR  185 and\ndistinguished it  on the facts by pointing out that it was a\ncase of	 the direct  recruits and  promotees integrated into\none cadre.  Once they  were integrated they lost their birth\nbirth-marks, viz.  the different   sources  from which	they\nwere recruited.	 [Emphasis supplied].  The court pointed out\nthat Roshan Lal&apos;s case [supra] was thus no authority for the\nproposition that  if direct  recruits  and    promotees	 are\nintegrated into	 one class  they cannot	 be  classified	 for\npurposed of promotion on a basis other than that in the case\nbefore the them the classified for purpose of promotion on a\nbasis  other  than  that  they	were  drawn  from  different\nsources.

','Shyamcharan Sharma Vs Dharamdas      CIVIL APPELLATE  JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 854, of\n1977.\n     Appeal by	Special Leave  from the	 Judgment and  order\ndated 2-8-1976	of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in S.A. No.\n440/71.\n     S. S. Khanduja and Lalit Kumar Gupta for the Appellant.\n     T. P. Naik and S. K. Gambhir for the Respondent.\n     The Judgment of the Court was delivered by\n     CHINNAPPA	REDDY,	 J.-The	 respondent-landlord  sought\neviction of  the appellant-tenant  from the suit premises an\ntwo grounds:  (i) failure  to pay  arrears of  rent  of	 Rs.\n158.25 despite service of notice of demand and (ii) bonafide\nrequirement of	premises for landlord&apos;s personal occupation.\nThe second  ground was	rejected by  all the  sub-  ordinate\ncourts and  we are  no longer concerned with that ground. In\nregard to  the first  ground, the trial Court found that the\ntenant was\n \nin arrears  of payment	of rent	 but  that  the	 tenant	 was\nentitled to the Protection of s. 12(3) of the Madhya Pradesh\nAccommodation Control Act, 1961, as the tenant had deposited\nthe arrears  of rent within the time allowed by the Court on\nhis application.  When the  appeal preferred by the landlord\nwas pending before the Additional District Judge, Satna, the\ntenant filed  an application  for condonation  of delay R in\ndepositing the	rent,  month  by  month,  which	 had  become\npayable after  the filing  of the  suit, as stipulated by s.\n13(1) of  the Act.  It appears	that, on  several occasions,\nwhen the  suit and  the appeal were pending before the trial\ncourt and  the appellate  court respectively, the tenant had\ndeposited the monthly rent a day or two or three, beyond the\nprescribed date.  The amount  had been received by the court\nand drawn  out	by  the	 landlord,  apparently	without	 any\nprotest. Taking	 advantage of  the filing  of  the  tenant&apos;s\napplication for condonation of delay, the landlord contended\nthat the  court had  no power to extend the time for deposit\nof the monthly rent and that he was entitled to a decree for\neviction  consequent   on  the	 non-compliance	  with	 the\nprovisions  of	 s.  13	  (  1	 )  of	the  Madhya  Pradesh\nAccommodation Control Act. The appellate court negatived the\nlandlord&apos;s contention and dismissed the appeal. The landlord\npreferred a  Second Appeal  to	the  High  Court  of  Madhya\nPradesh. The High Court, holding that the court had no power\nto extend  time, decreed  the suit for eviction. The tenant,\nhaving obtained special leave, has appealed to this Court.\n     Shri  Khanduja,  learned  counsel	for  the  appellant,\nraised two  contentions before	us. The first contention was\nthat the  High Court was wrong in holding that the Court had\nno power to condone the delay in depositing the monthly rent\nfalling due  after the	filing of the suit for eviction. The\nsecond contention  was that,  in the  circumstances  of	 the\ncase. the  respondent must  be considered  to have waived or\nabandoned the right to insist on dis-entitling the tenant of\nthe protection	to which  he was  otherwise  entitled.	Shri\nNaik, learned  counsel for  the respondent, contended to the\ncontrary on both the questions.\n     The Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Control Act, 1961, was\nenacted, as recited in the statement of objects and reasons,\n\"for the  purpose of  controlling, letting  of and  rents of\nresidential  and  nonresidential  accommodation	 and  giving\nadequate protection  to tenants	 of  such  accommodation  in\nareas where there is dearth of accommodation\". Section 12(1)\nof the	Act provides  that no  suit shall  be-filed ill	 any\ncivil court  against a	tenant for  his	 eviction  from	 any\naccommodation except on one or more of the grounds specified\ntherein. Several  grounds are specified, such as, failure to\npay the	 arrears of  rent after	 the service  of  notice  of\ndemand, unlawful sub-letting of the whole or\n \npart of	 the accommodation, creation of a nuisance, bonafide\nrequirement of the accommodation by the landlord for his own\noccupation,   causing	of   substantial   damage   to	 the\naccommodation  etc.  etc.  The	ground	with  which  we	 are\nconcerned is that mentioned in s. 12(1) (a) and-it is: \"that\nthe tenant  has neither	 paid nor  tendered the whole of the\narrears of  rent legally  recoverable from  him	 within	 two\nmonths of  the date  on which  a notice	 of demand  for	 the\narrears of  rent has  been served  on him by the landlord in\nthe prescribed	manner\". Thus,	where a tenant is in arrears\nof rent,  a landlord  is obliged,  before instituting a suit\nfor eviction  on that  ground, to  serve a  notice of demand\ncalling upon  the tenant  to pay  or tender the whole of the\narrears of  rent within two months of the date of service of\nthe notice. S. 12(3) provides that an order for the eviction\nof a  tenant shall not be made on the ground specified in s.\n12(1) (a),  if	the  tenant  makes  payment  or	 deposit  as\nrequired by  s. 13. S. 13,sub-ss. (1), (5) and (6) which are\nrelevant for the present purpose are as follows:\n	  \"13. (1)  on a suit or proceeding being instituted\n     by the landlord on any of the grounds referred to in s.\n     12, the  tenant shall,  within one month of the service\n     of the  writ of  summons on  him or within such further\n     time as  the Court	 may, on  an application made to it,\n     allow in  this behalf,  deposit in	 the Court or pay to\n     the landlord  an amount  calculated at the rate of rent\n     at which  it was  paid, for  the period  for which	 the\n     tenant may	 have  made  default  including	 the  period\n     subsequent thereto	 up to the end of the month previous\n     to that  in which	the deposit  or payment	 is made and\n     shall thereafter  continue to  deposit or pay, month by\n     month, by	the 15th  of each  succeeding  month  a	 sum\n     equivalent to the rent at that rate.\n     xx		xx	  xx	    xx	     xx\n	  (5) If  a  tenant  makes  deposit  or	 payment  as\n     required by  sub-section (1)  or  sub-section  (2),  no\n     decree or	order shall  be made  by the  Court for	 the\n     recovery of  possession of	 the  accommodation  on	 the\n     ground of default in the payment of rent by the tenant,\n     but the Court may allow such cost as it may deem fit to\n     the  The respondent-landlord	sought	 expulsion of	 the \r\n\r\nappealing party occupant from the suit	 premises for inability to pay \r\n\r\nunpaid debts of lease, regardless of administration of notice of interest. The \r\n\r\ntrial court found that the occupant was falling behind financially o. installment \r\n\r\nof lease, however the inhabitant having stored the back payments of lease \r\n\r\ninside the time permitted by the court on his application the \r\n\r\noccupant was qualified for benefit the security of segment 12(3) \r\n\r\nof the	Madhya Pradesh	Accommodation Control Act. 1961. furthermore, \r\n\r\nexpelled the suit for expulsion. \r\n\r\nThe proprietor favored an interest keeping in mind the same was \r\n\r\npending? the occupant recorded an application under area 13(1) \r\n\r\nof the	Act for	 approbation of	 delay in depositing,,	 the \r\n\r\nlease, month by month.	which had turned out to be payable after the \r\n\r\ndocumenting of the suit. On a few events, when the suit and \r\n\r\nthe interest were pending under the watchful eye of the trial court and	 the \r\n\r\ninvestigative court	 separately, the inhabitant had saved the \r\n\r\nmonth to month lease a day or a few past the endorsed \r\n\r\ndate, and the same had been gotten by the court and drawn \r\n\r\nout by	the landowner, with no dissent. The landowner, \r\n\r\nexploiting the documenting of the occupant s application \r\n\r\nfor condonation	 of postponement, fought that the court had no \r\n\r\nenergy to amplify the ideal opportunity for store of the month to month lease and \r\n\r\nthat he	 was qualified for an announcement for expulsion resulting on \r\n\r\nthe resistance with the arrangements of area 13(1) of \r\n\r\nthe Act. The redrafting court negatived this dispute and \r\n\r\nrejected the interest. In the second interest favored by the \r\n\r\nproprietor, the High Court held that the Court had no energy to \r\n\r\nbroaden time and declared the Suit for ousting. \r\n\r\nIn the occupant\'s interest to this Court on the question \r\n\r\nwhether the Court ha(l. the ability to overlook the deferral in \r\n\r\nsaving the month to month lease falling due after the filling of \r\n\r\nthe suit for ousting. \r\n\r\n^ \r\n\r\nHELD :1. The court had the purview to augment time \r\n\r\nfor store or installment of month to month lease falling due after the \r\n\r\nrecording of the suit. [338 G] \r\n\r\n2. Keeping in mind the end goal to qualifies an inhabitant for claim the insurance \r\n\r\nof area 12(3). the inhabitant needed to make installment or store \r\n\r\nas required by section	 13. The unfulfilled obligations of lease ought to be \r\n\r\npaid or	 stored inside one month of the administration of the \r\n\r\nwrit of summons on the inhabitant or inside such further time as \r\n\r\nmay he	allowed by the court, and ought to further store or \r\n\r\npay each month by the fifteenth. a whole identical to the lease. \r\n\r\n[338 A-B]. \r\n\r\n335 \r\n\r\n3. Failure	 to pay	 or store a whole identical to the \r\n\r\nlease by	 the fifteenth of consistently, ensuing to the recording \r\n\r\nof the	suit for removal will	 not entitle the proprietor, \r\n\r\nstraightaway, to a declaration for removal. The results of \r\n\r\nthe store or payment	 and non-installment or non-store are \r\n\r\nrecommended by subsection and (6) of segment 13. [338 B] \r\n\r\n4. A circumspection is vested in the court under segment \r\n\r\n13(6) to arrange the striking out of the, protection against \r\n\r\nexpulsion. [338 D] \r\n\r\n5. In the event that the court has the	discretion not to strike out \r\n\r\nthe protection or an inhabitant submitting default in installment or \r\n\r\nstore of lease as required by segment 13(1), the court \r\n\r\nmost likely has the further tact to approve the default and \r\n\r\namplify the ideal opportunity for installment or store. Such a tact is \r\n\r\na fundamental ramifications of the tact not to strike out \r\n\r\nthe defence.	Any other development may	lead, to a \r\n\r\ncorruption of the question of the Act. to be specific, \'the satisfactory \r\n\r\nsecurity of the occupant.\' [338 F-G] \r\n\r\n6. Section	 12(3) qualifies an inhabitant for claim insurance \r\n\r\nagainst removal on the ground indicated in area 12(1)(a) \r\n\r\nin the event that he makes installment or store as required by area 13. As \r\n\r\nthe court has under area 13, the ability to degree: the \r\n\r\ntime for installment or store, installment or store, inside the \r\n\r\naugmented time	 will entitle	 the inhabitant to claim	 the \r\n\r\ninsurance of segment 12(3). [338 H] 1 \r\n\r\n7. Express	 arrangement for augmentation of time for store \r\n\r\non the other hand installment or lease falling due after the documenting of the suit \r\n\r\nwas not	 made in area 13(1!	 as the	 result of non- \r\n\r\ninstallment was managed with	 by a different sub-area, segment \r\n\r\n13(6). The watchfulness given to the court under segment 13(6) \r\n\r\nmust suggest a caution to excuse the postponement and broaden the \r\n\r\ntime in	 making deposit	 or installment under area 13(1). \r\n\r\n[339A, E] \r\n\r\nJagdish Kapoor v.

The	Income	Tax  Officer\nlater  on came to know that the assessee&apos;s income  from	 the\nsale  of  estates had escaped assessment.

What is the line  which  separates\n	      the  two classes of cases may be difficult  to\n	      define,  and  each  case	must  be  considered\n	      according	 to  its facts; the question  to  be\n	      determined  being-Is the sum of gain that	 has\n	      been  made  a  mere enhancement  of  value  by\n	      realising	 a security or is it a gain made  in\n	      the  operation of business in carrying  out  a\n	      scheme for profit making ?\"\nBut  in judging the character of such  transactions  several\nfactors	 have been treated as significant in decided  cases.\nFor instance, if a transaction related to the business which\nis normally carried on by the assessee, though not  directly\na  part of it, an intention to launch upon an  adventure  in\nthe  nature  of trade may readily be  inferred.	  A  similar\ninference  would  arise where a commodity is  purchased	 and\nsub-divided,  altered,	treated or repaired and sold  or  is\nconverted  into	 a different commodity and then	 sold.	 The\nmagnitude of the transaction of purchase, the nature of	 the\ncommodity,  the	 subsequent dealings of	 the  assessee,	 the\nnature of the Organisation employed by the assessee and	 the\nmanner of disposal may be such that, the transaction may  be\nstamped	 with the character of a trading nature.  In  Martin\nv.  Lowry, (2) the assessee purchased a large  quantity of\naeroplane  linen and sold it in different lots, and for	 the\npurpose of  selling it started	an  advertising	 campaign,\nrented	offices	  engaged an advertising  manager,  a  linen\nexpert	and  a	staff of clerks.  maintained  account  books\nnormally used by a trader, and passed receipts add payment\n(1) [1904] 5 S.T.C. 159,16-66.\n(2) 11 Tax Cases 297.\n \nin  connection	with the linen through	a  separate  banking\naccount.,  It  was  held that the  assessee  carried  on  an\nadventure  in  the  nature of trade and so  the	 profit	 was\nliable to be taxed.  The same view was taken in Rutledge  v.\nCommissioners of Inland Revenue(1) in regard to an  assessee\nwho  purchased very cheaply a vast quantity of toilet  paper\nand   within  a	 short	time  thereafter  sold	 the   whole\nconsignment   at  a  considerable  profit.   Similarly,	  in\nCommissioner of Inland Revenue v. Fraser (2) the assessee, a\nwoodcutter,  bought  for resale, whisky in  bond,  in  three\n&apos;lots.	 He  sold it later on at considerable  profit.	 The\nassessee had never dealt in whisky before, he had no special\nknowledge  of  the  trade he did not take  delivery  of	 the\nwhisky	nor did he have it blended and advertised.  Even  so\nit  was	 held that the transaction was an adventure  in	 the\nnature	of  trade.  Lord President Normand observed  in	 the\ncourse of the judgment :\n	      \"It  is  in general more easy to hold  that  a\n	      single   transaction   entered  into   by	  an\n	      individual  in  the  line	 of  his  own  trade\n	      (although not part and parcel of his  ordinary\n	      business)	 is  an adventure in the  nature  of\n	      trade than to hold that a transaction  entered\n	      into by an individual outside the line of	 his\n	      own trade or occupation is an adventure in the\n	      nature of trade.	But what is a good deal more\n	      important	 is  the nature of  the	 transaction\n	      with reference to the commodity dealt in.	 The\n	      individual  who enters into a purchase  of  an\n	      article  or  commodity may have  in  view	 the\n	      resale  of it at a profit, and yet it  may  be\n	      that  is	not the only purpose  for  which  he\n	      purchased	 the article of the  commodity,	 nor\n	      the only purpose to which he might turn it  if\n	      favourable opportunity of sale does not occur.\n	      In some of the cases the purchase of a picture\n	      has been given as an illustration.  An amateur\n	      may  purchase  a picture with a  view  to	 its\n	      resale  at a profit, and yet he may  recognise\n	      at the time or afterwards that the  possession\n	      of   the	picture	 will  give  him   aesthetic\n	      enjoyment	 if he is unable ultimately,  or  at\n	      his chosen time, to realise it at a profit.  A\n	      man may purchase stocks and shares with a view\n	      to selling them at an early date at a  profit,\n	      but, if he does so, he is purchasing something\n	      which  is	 itself an investment,	a  potential\n	      source of revenue to him while he holds it.  A\n	      man may purchase land with a view to realising\n	      it  at a profit, but it also may yield him  an\n	      income  while he continues to hold it.  If  he\n	      continues	 to  hold it, there may	 be  also  a\n	      certain pride of possession But the  purchaser\n	      of  a  large  quantity  of  a  commodity	like\n	      whisky,  greatly	in excess of what  could  be\n	      used by\n	      (1) 14Tax Cases490.\n	      (2) 24 Tax Cases 498.\n \n	      himself,	his family and friends, a  commodity\n	      which  yields  no pride of  possession,  which\n	      cannot  be  turned  to account  except  by.  a\n	      process	of  realisation,  I   can   scarcely\n	      consider	to be other than an adventure  in  a\n	      transaction  in the nature of a trade;  and  I\n	      can find no single fact among those stated  by\n	      the  Commissioners which in any way  traverses\n	      that  view.  In my opinion, the fact that	 the\n	      transaction  was	not in the way	of  business\n	      (whatever it was) of the respondent in no	 way\n	      alters the character which almost	 necessarily\n	      belongs to a transaction like this\".\nThese are cases of commercial commodities but a	 transaction\nof purchase of land cannot be assumed without more to be  an\nadventure in the nature of trade.  In Leeming v. Jones,(1) a\nsyndicate  was	formed to acquire an option  over  a  rubber\nestate with a view to resell it at a profit, and finding the\nestate	too small the syndicate acquired another estate	 and\nsold  the  two	estates on profit.  It	was  held  that	 the\ntransaction  was not in the nature of trade and	 the  profit\nwas  not  liable to be assessed to tax.	 The same  view	 was\nexpressed in Saroj Kumar Mazumdar v. Commissioner of  Income\nTax  (2)  in which the assessee who carried on	business  of\nengineering   works   purchased	 land,	 which	 was   under\nrequisition by the Government, negotiated a sale before	 the\nland  was  de-requisitioned and sold it after the  land	 was\nreleased.   But the circumstances of a particular  case	 may\nlead to the conclusion that the purchaser resale of land  is\nin  the	 nature of trade.  In Venkataswami Naidu  &amp;  Co.  v.\nCommissioner of Income Tax(3) the appellant firm which acted\nas  managing agents purchas  the appellant was assessed for the assessment year 1956-57 on a total income of Rs. 8,400. The Income Tax Officer later on came to know that the assessee\'s income from the sale of estates had escaped assessment. The Income Tax Officer took action under section 34(1) (a) of the Income Tax Act, 1922 for the assessment year 1956-57 on 13th August, 1959. Under an agreement dated 18th May, 1955 a company called Mundakayam Valley Rubber Co. Ltd. sold and delivered an estate called Kuttikal Estate to one Mr. A. V. George. The area of the estate was 477 acres and 71 cents. Mr. A. V. George had entered into the agreement in his own name and on behalf of another company called the Kailas Rubber Co. Ltd. It was agreed that the vendor would execute the necessary conveyance in favour of Mr. A. V. George or his nominees. On 15th August. 1955. the assessee entered into an agreement with Mr. A. V. George whereby the assessee agreed to purchase 477.71 acres forming part of Kuttikal Estate for Rs. 6 lakhs. An advance of Rs. 1 1,000 was paid by the assessee. The balance of Rs. 5,89,000 was to be paid by the assessee on or before 25th September, 1955. It was agreed that Mr. A. V. George should execute a sale-deed himself or cause it to be executed Kailas Rubber Co. Ltd. on whose behalf he was acting in favour of the assessee or his nominees. The assessee subsequently divided the area of 477.71 acres into 23 plots and found purchasers for 22 of these, plots. The total extent of 22 plots for which he found purchasers was 373.58 acres and the total price paid by the 22 purchasers was Rs. 5,18,500. A sale deed was executed by the Mundakayam Valley Rubber Co. Ltd. on 31st March, 1956. It covered all the 23 plots. The 22 plots for which the assessee found purchasers were conveyed to the respective purchasers and the 23rd plot was conveyed to the assesses himself. Mr. A. V. George and the Kailas Rubber Co. Ltd. were parties to this document. The plot which the assessee had retained for himself was 104.13 acres in extent. Its value was estimated by the Income Tax Officer at Rs. 2,08,000. \r\nheld: he Income-tax authorities have correctly estimated the profit of the assessee by treating the land as stock-in-trade and valuing it according to the normal accountancy practice. \r\nappeal dismissed ','Bakhshish Singh Vs Union Of India (Uoi) And Ors. JUDGMENT\n  \n\nO. Chinnappa Reddy, J.\n \n\n1. Bakhshish Singh, the appellant, was appointed an Assistant in the Punjab Civil Secretariat on December 7, 1948 and was confirmed on September 1, 1956. Manohar Singh, Sardar Singh, D. Justin and Prithipal Singh Chawala, respondents 3 to 6 were also Assistants in &apos;. the Punjab Civil Secretariat, but were junior to the appellant. All of them were working as Assistants on November 1, 1956 when consequent on the State&apos;s Reorganisation Act, the former States of Punjab and PEPSU were merged into one State. On merger the conditions of service of those employed by the former States of Punjab and PEPSU were protected as provided by Sections 115(7) and 117 of the State&apos;s Reorganisation Act. The rules in force at that time, which governed them, were the Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Services Class III) Rules, 1952. Rule 6(1)(b) provided that posts of Superintendents, Records in the service were to be filled by selection among Assistants. Posts of Assistants-in-charge were to be filled (i) by promotion of Assistants; or (ii) by transfer or deputation of an official already in Government service. Rule 6 (1) (c) provided that posts of Assistants-in-charge were to be filled (i) by promotion of Assistants; or (ii) by transfer or deputation of an official already in Government service. Rule 6(I)(d) provided that the post of Superintendent, Military Secretary to Governor&apos;s office was to be filled by selection amongst\n Assistant. In October, 1963, the posts of Superintendents were made class II posts and came to be governed by the Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Service Class II) Rules. Rule 8(1)(a) provided that posts of Superintendents other than the Superintendent in the Press Branch were to be made (i) by promotion from amongst Deputy Superintendents, Assistants-in-charge and Assistants, who are members of the Punjab Civil Secretariat\n (State Service Class III) with minimum experience of one year as Deputy Superintendent or a total experience of 10 years as an Assistant; or (ii) by direct recruitment or by transfer or deputation of an official already in Government service holding a ministerial post. We are not concerned with the proviso to Rule 8(I)(a). Rule 8(I)(b) dealt with the post of Superintendent, Press Branch with which also we are not concerned. While this was so, as an experimental measure some posts of Assistant Section Officers were created which were not posts which belonged either to the Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Services Class III) or Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Services Class II). Appointment\n to these posts were to be made from Assistants belonging to the Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Services Class III) on the basis of an examination to be held by the Public Service Commission. Respondents 3 to 6 were selected and appointed as Assistant Section Officers as they were successful in the examination. The appellant either did not appear at the examination or was not successful at the examination. Therefore, he continued as Assistant in the Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Service Class III). By an order dated March 14, 1961, the Government expressly provided that the seniority of those appointed as Assistant Section Officers in their normal lines as Assistants will remain unchanged and that their promotion as Deputy Superintendents/Superintendents will be governed by their seniority as Assistants. Even so some Assistant Section Officers were promoted as Superintendents without reference to their seniority as Assistants. The promotions were quashed by the Punjab High Court in Roshan Lal Sharma&apos;s 1966 Ct. L J. 848 case. The State of Punjab thereupon thought fit to amend the Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Services Class II) by introducing a new Rule 8(I)(a)(i) in the place of the old Rule 8(I)(a)(i) which was as follows :-\n (i) By promotion from amongst Assistant Section Officers and such Deputy Superintendents, Assistants-in-charge and Assistants as are member of the Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Service Class III) with minimum experience of one year as a Deputy Superintendent or a total experience of ten years as an Assistant. \n \n\nTwo explanations were added and Explanation II provided that the number of posts of Superintendent and Section Officers available for promotion from amongst\n Assistant Section Officers shall bear the some proportion to the total number of such posts as the branch manned by Assistant Section Officers and Section Officers bear to the number of branches manned by Assistants and Superintendents, the method of promotion to vacancies available in such proportion being that persons, other than the Assistant Section Officers shall be promoted first and the Assistant Section Officers shall be promoted thereafter and so on. The Government of Punjab thought it advisable to obtain the approval of the Central Government as the High Court in Roshan Lal Sharma&apos;s case had said that the promotion of Assistant Section Officers to the posts of Superintendents based on their seniority as Assistant Section Officers was violative of the guarantees given by the State&apos;s Reorganisation Act. After seeking some clarification from the State Government, the Government of India wrote to the State Government as follows : -\n \n \n\nNo. 17/57/66-SR (S)\n \n\nGovernment of India/Ministry of Home Affairs.\n \n\nTo \n\nThe Chief Secretary to Government of Punjab, Secretariat Administration, Chandigarh.\n \n\nNew Delhi-1, the 20th May, 1967.\n \n\nSub : Integration of Services in Punjab-Rules for promotion to the post of Superintendent-Provision for promotion of Assistant Section Officers-Approval of the Central Government under the S.R.

In view of the fact that under the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, retrospective approval cann  Service- state of administration - Sections 115 and 117 of States Reorganization Act, 1956 and Rules 6 (I) and 8 (I) of Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Service Class III) Rules,1952 - claim against expulsion of request of testing advancement of respondents - respondents were junior to appellants - litigant fought ensure given to litigant by Sections115 (7) and 117 abused if there should be an occurrence of making of posts of Assistant Section Officers and by arrangement of advancement to posts of Superintendent in Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Service Class II) - making of new posts outside Class III administration and making people holding those posts qualified for advancement decreased odds of advancement of Assistants having a place with Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Service Class III) - there was no repudiation of Section 115 (7) - there was no adjustment in states of administration - respondents were youngsters to appealing party in framework of Assistants - appealing party did not profit himself of chance stood to him to qualify himself as Assistant Section Officer by passing recommended examination - appealing party can\'t be heard to whine that the individuals who were youngsters to him as Assistant have stolen walk over him - offer expelled.

She met with an accident on or about\n\n20.9.1999 while she was aged only 9 years. In the said accident she suffered\n\nthe following injuries, as stated in the application filed on her behalf before\n\nthe Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal :\n\n\n             1.     There is swelling deformity &amp; fracture of\n                    middle 3rd of Lt. thigh (femur shaft).\n             2.     Abrasion over left frontal region.\n \n\n             3.     Abrasion over Rt. Lateral aspect.\"\n\n\n3.    She was treated by two doctors. According to one of them, namely,\n\nDr. Mukund, who examined himself as PW3, she suffered 10% to 15% of\n\ndisability whereas according to the other doctor, Dr. Shivanand, she suffered\n\n20% to 25% of physical disability in her left lower limb.\n\n\n      An amount of Rs.3,00,000/- was claimed by her by way of\n\ncompensation in the claim petition before the Motor Accidents Claims\n\nTribunal under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereinafter\n\ncalled and referred to for the sake of brevity as `the Act&apos;). The Tribunal,\n\nhowever, having regard to the evidences brought on record, opining that\n\npermanent disability suffered by her would be 10%, a sum of Rs.40,000/-\n\nawarded on the said ground. The total amount of compensation determined\n\nwas a sum of Rs.72,785/- details of which are as under :\n\n\n                   \"Rs.18,000/- towards pain and sufferings\n             and agony, Rs. 12,460 towards diet and attendant\n             charges and Rs.323/- were awarded towards\n             medical expenses.\"\n\n\n4.    On an appeal preferred thereagainst, the High Court, without\n\nassigning any reason, enhanced the amount of compensation to\n\nRs.1,12,000/-, stating :\n \n\n            \"Petitioner could be awarded Rs.30,000/- for pain\n            and agony, Rs.10,000/- for medical and incidental\n            expenses relating to treatment, Rs.15,000/- for loss\n            of amenities and discomfort on account of\n            disability, Rs.27,000/- (1500 X 18) for loss of\n            future earnings on account of disability and\n            Rs.20,000/- for loss of marriage prospects on\n            account of disability. In all, the petitioner is\n            entitled to the compensation of Rs.1,12,000/- as\n            against Rs.72,785/- awarded by the Tribunal. On\n            the enhanced compensation, the interest payable\n            shall be 6% p.a. from the date of petition till\n            payment.\"\n\n\n5.    Appellant being aggrieved by and dissatisfied therewith is before us.\n\n\n6.    Mr. P.V.V. Shetty, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\nappellant, would contend that the High Court committed a serious error in\n\nawarding only a sum of Rs.1,12,000/- without taking into consideration her\n\nprospect of marriage. The amount of compensation on the basis of notional\n\nincome should not have been determined, urging that even if she was to\n\nwork as a labourer, she would have earned at Rs.4,000/- per month.\n\n\n7.    Indisputably, she was a child at that time. She had no earning. What\n\namount could be awarded towards future loss of earning or prospective loss\n\nof earning could not have been determined on the basis of any legal\n\nprinciple. Compensation for the injuries suffered by a person in a motor\n\nvehicle accident can be determined either on the basis of the actual damages\n\nsuffered or upon application of the structured formula. Although for the\n \n\npurpose of invoking the provisions of Section 163A of the Act, a legal\n\nprinciple may be found in the Second Schedule thereof.           The Second\n\nSchedule provides that where no income is proved, notional income for the\n\npurpose of payment of compensation to those who had no income prior to\n\naccident, a sum of Rs.15,000/- per annum would be considered as the\n\nmultiplicand. The multiplier which was required to be applied would be 15.\n\nParagraph 4 and 5 of the said Schedule reads as under :\n\n\n            \"4.

The exact prayer, contained in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 173  of  2010,\r\n    would give a glimpse of  the  nature  of  the  case  set  up  by  these\r\n    petitioners and the precise relief which these  petitioners  pray  for.\r\n    This prayer reads as under:\r\n               It is, therefore, respectfully prayed that Your  Lordships  may\r\n            graciously be pleased to:\r\n\r\n\r\n               i) Issue a writ, order or direction directing the respondents\r\n                  more particularly Respondent Nos. 1 to 3  to  appoint  the\r\n                  petitioners and similarly circumstanced  Trained  Teachers\r\n                  in order of seniority.\r\n\r\n\r\n              ii) Issue a writ, order or direction directing the respondents\r\n                  and more particularly the State of  Jharkhand  (Respondent\r\n                  Nos. 1 to 3)  to  protect  fundamental  right  of  Primary\r\n                  Education  to  the  children  of  State  of  Jharkhand  by\r\n                  appointing the Trained Teachers available in the Jharkhand\r\n                  State  on  the  sanctioned  vacant  posts   of   Assistant\r\n                  Teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n             iii) Pass such other or orders as this Honourable Court  may  deem\r\n                  fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of the  case\r\n                  and in the interests of justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  The background in which these petitions have come  to  be\r\n     filed is somewhat detailed one with chequered  history,  riddled  with\r\n     previous litigation  benefit  whereof  the  petitioners  are  seeking.\r\n     However, we would endeavour to traverse through  these  events  in  as\r\n     simple a manner as possible.\r\n     3.     As is well known, the State of Jharkhand  was  created  in  the\r\n     year 2000. Before that it was a part of the State of Bihar. All  these\r\n     petitioners belong to undivided Bihar vintage. They  claim  that  they\r\n     are  qualified   and   trained   teachers   who   acquired   requisite\r\n     qualification  and  underwent  necessary  training  and  thus   became\r\n     eligible to be considered for appointment as primary teachers  in  the\r\n     schools run by the State Government  as  per  the  provisions  of  the\r\n     Extant Rules on the subject. However, even  when  the  Government  was\r\n     legally bound to appoint only the trained teachers, on the basis of an\r\n     advertisement issued on 6.10.1991  by  the  Government  of  Bihar  for\r\n     filling up of 25,000 posts of Assistant Teachers, the State  recruited\r\n     17,281  untrained  teachers  out  of  total  appointments  of   19,272\r\n     Assistant  Teachers  made  in  the  said  recruitment  process.   This\r\n     selection was challenged by some persons by filing  writ  petition  in\r\n     the High Court of Judicature at Patna which was decided on  26.9.1996.\r\n     The High Court did not quash the appointments already made, though  at\r\n     the same time it held that the State  would  not  force  a  person  to\r\n     confine his application to a particular district. Against this  order,\r\n     Special Leave Petition No. 23187 of 1996  was  preferred  before  this\r\n     Court. In those proceedings an affidavit dated 14.8.1997 was filed  by\r\n     the Deputy Superintendent of Education, Bihar Government  agreeing  to\r\n     appoint trained teacher against existing vacancies. Having  regard  to\r\n     the averments made in the said affidavit, SLP  was  disposed  of  vide\r\n     order dated 5.9.1997. This case is known as Ram Vinay Kumar &amp; Ors.  v.\r\n     State of Bihar and  Ors.  (1998)  9  SCC  227.  The  exact  directions\r\n     regarding appointment to the post of  Assistant  Teachers  which  were\r\n     given by this Court are the following:\r\n              (i)  The Commission shall conduct a special selection  for  the\r\n           purpose of appointment of  these  unfilled  posts  from  amongst\r\n           applicants who had submitted their applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n           (ii)  The selection shall be confined to  applicants  possessing\r\n           teacher\'s  training/  qualification  obtained  from  government/\r\n           private teacher\'s training institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n           (iii) The selection shall be made by holding a preliminary  test\r\n           and a written examination of the candidates who qualify  in  the\r\n           preliminary test.\r\n\r\n\r\n       iv) In case the number of persons found suitable for appointment  in\r\n           such special selection exceeds the number  of  posts  for  which\r\n           recruitment was to be made on the basis of  advertisement  dated\r\n           6.10.1991, the surplus number of candidates who have been  found\r\n           suitable for the appointment would be justified against posts to\r\n           be filled on the basis of subsequent selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        v) The special selection which is to be conducted in  pursuance  of\r\n           these  directions  shall  be  completed  by  the  Commission  by\r\n           31.1.1997.   \r\n\r\n\r\n  4. In nut-shell, the direction was to conduct  a  special  selection  for\r\n     filling up of the unfilled posts from amongst the applicants  who  had\r\n     already submitted their applications  pursuant  to  the  advertisement\r\n     issued and it  was  to  be  confined  to  those  applicants  who  were\r\n     possessing teachers training/ qualification obtained from  Government/\r\n     private teachers\' training institution i.e. from amongst  the  trained\r\n     teachers. As per the petitioners as  on  30.9.1993  there  were  about\r\n     45,000 vacancies in as much as against total post of 2,09,981,  number\r\n     of teachers working were 1,54,751. Furthermore, in  next  three  years\r\n     about 18,431 teachers were expected to  retire.  Therefore,  projected\r\n     vacancies were approximately 63,000. On the creation of the  State  of\r\n     Jharkhand in terms of Bihar  Reorganisation  Act,  2000  proportionate\r\n     vacancies i.e. one-third came to the share of State of Jharkhand which\r\n     would mean that 21,000 vacancies were available on the date  on  which\r\n     this State was created.\r\n     5.     It is stated by the petitioners that for almost  7  years  from\r\n     the date of directions given in Ram Vinay Kumar\'s Case, no action  was\r\n     taken. It forced certain sections of trained teachers to approach  the\r\n     Patna High Court by way of several  Writ  Petitions.  All  these  Writ\r\n     Petitions were heard together with leading case known as Nand  Kishore\r\n     Ojha &amp; Ors. v. State of Bihar and Ors. (CWJC 13246/2003).  These  Writ\r\n     Petitions were allowed by the Patna High  Court  vide  judgment  dated\r\n     1.7.2004. In the said judgment it was inter alia noted that there were\r\n     number of unfilled vacancies because of  which  primary  schools  were\r\n     lying empty. The High Court deprecated the inaction on the part of the\r\n     Government of Bihar in not implementing the judgment of this Court  in\r\n     Ram Vinay Kumar\'s Case, on one pretext or the other, thereby  creating\r\n     a human rights problem in denying a  young  generation  its  right  to\r\n     basic education. According to the High Court, the solution was  simple\r\n     viz. to follow the judgment of this Court in Ram  Vinay  Kumar\'s  case\r\n     from where the circumstances has been left out. The  High  Court  also\r\n     calculated the number of existing  vacancies  in  the  manner  already\r\n     pointed out above.  On this basis direction was given to carry out the\r\n     selection process as per the mandate of this Court  contained  in  the\r\n     case of Ram Vinay Kumar.\r\n     6.     The State of Bihar challenged the aforesaid  judgment  of  High\r\n     Court by filing  Special  Leave  Petitions  in  this  Court.  However,\r\n     thereafter affidavit dated 18.1.2006 was filed by the Commissioner-cum-\r\n     Secretary, Education Department,  Government  of  Bihar  alongwith  an\r\n     application for withdrawal of those Special Leave  Petitions.  In  the\r\n     affidavit an undertaking was given that  only  trained  teachers  were\r\n     appointed as Assistant teachers in the State of Bihar.  Further  owing\r\n     to the reason that the number of available teachers in  the  State  of\r\n     Bihar were less than the available sanctioned post  and  no  test  for\r\n     selection was required. On the basis of this affidavit,  orders  dated\r\n     23.1.2006 were  passed  permitting  the  Government  to  withdraw  the\r\n     Special Leave Petitions.\r\n     7.     When the undertaking  given  in  the  said  affidavit  was  not\r\n     implemented  immediately  thereafter,  some  persons  filed   Contempt\r\n     Petition No. 207 of 2006 in this Court which was disposed of by orders\r\n     dated 19.3.2007 with a direction to the State of  Bihar  to  implement\r\n     its undertaking.\r\n            Operative part of the said order reads as under:\r\n              In paragraph 17 of the said affidavit in reply dated  7.2.2007,\r\n           it is stated that priority has been given to trained teachers in\r\n           appointment and only if trained teachers are  not  available  in\r\n           sufficient  numbers,  the  case  of   untrained   teachers   are\r\n           considered by the concerned  by  the  Panchayati  Raj  Institute\r\n           (PRI) to achieve the constitutional goal of free and  compulsory\r\n           education for children from age 6-14, and  in  this  regard  the\r\n           State of Bihar and other  answering  respondents  are  complying\r\n           with the orders of the High Court and  also  of  this  Court.  A\r\n           rejoinder has also been filed by the  petitioner  disputing  the\r\n           statements made by the State of Bihar  in  the  affidavit  dated\r\n           7.2.2007.\r\n                 In view of the categorical statement  now  made  that  the\r\n           priority will be given to the trained  teachers  in  appointment\r\n           and also the clarification made  in  paragraphs  19  to  222  of\r\n           aforesaid affidavit dated 7.2.2007, we direct the State of Bihar\r\n           to implement the undertaking given by the State of Bihar earlier\r\n           and also now by the present affidavit dated 7.2.2007  in  letter\r\n           and spirit by appointing the trained teachers on priority basis.\r\n                 The Contempt Petition is disposed of accordingly.   \r\n\r\n\r\n     8.     Still this undertaking was  not  complied  with  which  led  to\r\n     filing of another Contempt  Petition  No.  297  of  2007  titled  Nand\r\n     Kishore Ojha v. Anjani Kumar Singh  in which following interim  orders\r\n     dated 9.12.2009 were passed.\r\n              Accordingly, without issuing a Rule of Contempt, we direct that\r\n           the 34,540 vacancies shown as  available  in  the  advertisement\r\n           published in December, 2003,  be  filled  up  from  amongst  the\r\n           trained teachers who are available, in order  of  seniority.  As\r\n           indicated above, this is to be done on a one-time basis and must\r\n           not be taken as the regular practice to be followed.\r\n           Let the Contempt Petition be adjourned for a further  period  of\r\n           six weeks to enable the State Government to implement this order\r\n           and to submit a report on the next date as to the result of  the\r\n           discussions  held  between  the  petitioner  and  the  concerned\r\n           authorities.   \r\n\r\n\r\n     9.     Thereafter, the State of Bihar filled up  the  vacant  post  of\r\n     Assistant Teachers in terms of its undertaking thereby recruiting from\r\n     amongst the trained teachers who had applied earlier, pursuant to  the\r\n     advertisement given in the year 1991. Many had become over aged in the\r\n     meantime, and age relaxation was given in their cases.\r\n     10.    What is narrated above is the  history  of  litigation  in  the\r\n     State of  Bihar.  In  so  far  as  State  of  Jharkhand  is  concerned\r\n     (respondent herein),  as  already  pointed  out  above,  approximately\r\n     21,000 vacant post were transferred  to  this  State.  The  respondent\r\n     advertised these vacancies in the year 2002 by  giving  relaxation  in\r\n     age by 5 years only. Because of this reason many trained teachers,  in\r\n     which category of the petitioners include, could not be  appointed  as\r\n     Assistant Teachers, being overage. The petitioners, in this  backdrop,\r\n     contend that they are entitled to the benefit  of  Ram  Vinay  Kumar\'s\r\n     judgment of this Court  rendered  much  before  the  creation  of  the\r\n     Jharkhand State and applied to the erstwhile  unified  Bihar  and  the\r\n     judgment be implemented in their case as well as it has  happened  qua\r\n     the trained teachers in State of Bihar in the manner explained  above.\r\n     We may point out  at  this  stage  that  respondent  State  is  making\r\n     appointment only from amongst trained teachers. The problem,  however,\r\n     has arisen because fo the reason that these  petitioners  have  become\r\n     over aged and wanted total age relaxation. To put it, succinctly  they\r\n     are claiming parity with their counterparts in the State of Bihar  and\r\n     submitting that when those  teachers  were  appointed  by  giving  age\r\n     relaxation, there is no reason to deprive  the  petitioners  from  the\r\n     same treatment which would, otherwise, be discriminatory and violative\r\n     of Article 14 of the Constitution.\r\n     11.    The petitioners have pointed out that the respondent-State  had\r\n     set up a Committee in the year 2001 for implementation of the judgment\r\n     and even the said Committee in its report dated 31.5.2001  recommended\r\n     that all vacancies in the State of Jharkhand be  filled  with  trained\r\n     teachers  within  two  months.  The  operative  portion  of  the  said\r\n     recommendation reads as under:\r\n              Since the Government at its own  level  have  imparted  teacher\r\n           training to the thousands and the trained teachers were  in  the\r\n           hope for the two decades  that  they  will  be  appointed  as  a\r\n           teacher.  It  is  totally  unjustified  and  in-human  that  the\r\n           Government appoints untrained persons  and  thereby  ruined  the\r\n           future of trained teachers. Therefore,  the  committee  here  by\r\n           recommends that all the vacancies in the State of  Jharkhand  be\r\n           fulfill with trained teachers within  2  months.  If  number  of\r\n           trained teachers exceeds  the  number  of  vacancies,  then  the\r\n           vacancies be fulfilled on the basis of seniority of the  trained\r\n           teachers  i.e.  in  the  order  of   their   getting   training.\r\n           Thereafter,  the  trained  teachers   remained   unemployed   be\r\n           appointed  against  subsequent  vacancies.  In  the  appointment\r\n           process the  All the petitioners, in the Writ Petitions filed under&nbsp;Article 32&nbsp;of the Constitution of India, are similarly situated. After getting the requisite training they have acquired the nomenclature of \'trained teachers\'. They seek an appointments in the schools run by the Respondent-State of Jharkhand as assistant teachers. Some IAs filed by several similarly situated teachers for impleadment and seeking the same relief. It is for this reason that these petitions were conjointly heard.The direction was to conduct a special selection for filling up of the unfilled posts from amongst the applicants who had already submitted their applications pursuant to the advertisement issued and it was to be confined to those applicants who were possessing teachers training/ qualification obtained from Government/ private teachers\' training institution i.e. from amongst the trained teachers.&nbsp;The High Court deprecated the inaction on the part of the Government of Bihar in not implementing the judgment of this Court .The High Court also calculated the number of existing vacancies .The State of Bihar challenged the aforesaid judgment of High Court by filing Special Leave Petitions in this Court.Thereafter, the State of Bihar filled up the vacant post of Assistant Teachers in terms of its undertaking thereby recruiting from amongst the trained teachers who had applied earlier, pursuant to the advertisement given in the year 1991. Many had become over aged in the meantime, and age relaxation was given in their cases.Having regard to the above it would not be permissible to the petitioners to compare their case with their counterparts in Bihar. As far as the counterparts in the State of Bihar are concerned they had filed writ petitions well in time i.e. way back in the year 2003 in Patna High Court wherein those persons succeeded. The Patna High Court allowed those writ petitions vide judgment dated 1.7.2004 directing the State of Bihar to implement the judgment in Ram Vinay Kumar\'s Case. In such circumstances this Court would not be inclined to grant any relief to the petitioners in these petitions filed under&nbsp;Article 32&nbsp;of the Constitution, more so when it is found that the respondent/ State of Jharkhand has taken steps in conformity with the statutory recruitment rules framed under proviso to&nbsp;Article 309&nbsp;of the Constitution.Finding no merits in these writ petitions, same were dismissed. All pending I.As also stand dismissed. I.As Disposed','Punjab State Warehousing Corp Vs Bhushan Chander & Anr Dipak Misra, J.\r\n\r\n\r\n      The singular question that has emanated in  this  appeal,  by  special\r\nleave, is whether the High  Court  has  correctly  accepted  the  submission\r\nadvanced on behalf of the first respondent, who was convicted  for  offences\r\npunishable under Section 409/467/468/471 of  the  Indian  Penal  Code,  1860\r\n(for short,    IPC   ) and had been awarded sentence for each  of  the  offences\r\nwith the stipulation that they would run  concurrently,  that  he  being  an\r\nemployee of the appellant Corporation is a public servant and the trial  had\r\ncommenced without obtaining sanction  under  Section  197  of  the  Code  of\r\nCriminal Procedure, 1973  (CrPC)  and  hence,  the  trial  in  entirety  was\r\ninvalid and as a result the conviction  and  sentence  deserved  to  be  set\r\naside.\r\n2.    As far as the factual narration is  concerned,  suffice  it  to  state\r\nthat the Managing Director of  the  Corporation  had  written  a  letter  on\r\n28.6.1989 to the concerned police authority to register a case  against  the\r\nfirst respondent for offences punishable under Sections 409/467/468 and  471\r\nof  the  IPC  or  any  other   appropriate   provision   of   law.    During\r\ninvestigation, the investigating agency  found  that  the  accused  who  was\r\nworking as a Godown Assistant in  the  Corporation  had  misappropriated  11\r\ngunny bales value of which was Rs.38,841/-; that he had  tampered  with  the\r\nrecord of the department; and accordingly the police authorities  filed  the\r\ncharge-sheet for the  aforesaid  offences  before  the  court  of  competent\r\nJudicial Magistrate.  The  learned  Magistrate  on  the  basis  of  evidence\r\nbrought on record, found that the prosecution had been able  to  bring  home\r\nthe guilt against the  accused  and  accordingly  sentenced  him  to  suffer\r\nrigorous imprisonment for three years under Section 467 and 409 IPC and  two\r\nyears under Section 468/471 IPC with separate default clauses. The  judgment\r\nof conviction and order of  sentence  was  assailed  in  appeal  before  the\r\nlearned Session Judge, Firozpur and the matter  was  finally  heard  by  the\r\nlearned Additional Session Judge, who appreciating the evidence  on  record,\r\nconcurred with the conviction but  modified  the  sentence  of  three  years\r\nimposed under Section 409 and 467 IPC to two years.\r\n3.    Being dissatisfied, the first respondent preferred  Criminal  Revision\r\nNo. 359/2001 in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh.   Before\r\nthe revisional court, the only contention that was raised pertained to  non-\r\nobtaining of sanction under Section 197 CrPC.   It  was  argued  before  the\r\nlearned Single Judge that in view of the decisions in State  of  Maharashtra\r\nv. Dr. Budhikota Subbarao[1], Rakesh Kumar Mishra  v.  State  of  Bihar  and\r\nothers[2], Sankaran Moitra v. Sadhna Das and another[3],  Om  Kumar  Dhankar\r\nv. State of Haryana[4], the requisite sanction  having  not  been  obtained,\r\nthe trial was vitiated.  On behalf of the Corporation as well as  the  State\r\nof Punjab, it was argued that the sanction under Section 197  CrPC  was  not\r\nnecessary to prosecute the first respondent and  to  substantiate  the  said\r\nstand, reliance was  placed  on  Dr.  Lakshmansingh  Himatsingh  Vaghela  v.\r\nNaresh Kumar Chadrrashanker Jah[5], N. Bhargavan Pillai (dead) by  Lrs.  and\r\nanother v. State of Kerala[6],   State  of  U.P.  v.  Paras  Nath  Singh[7],\r\nRaghunath Anant Govilkar v. State of Maharashtra[8]  and  Choudhury  Parveen\r\nSultana v. State of West Bengal[9].\r\n4.    The learned Single Judge referred to the charges framed under  Section\r\n409 and 467 IPC.  He also referred  to  the  authorities  in  Prakash  Singh\r\nBadal v. State of Punjab[10], Nirmal Singh Kahlon v.  State  of  Punjab[11],\r\nOm Kumar Dhankar (supra) and Bakshish Singh  Brar  v.  Gurmel  Kaur[12]  and\r\nanalyzing Section 197 CrPC observed that the  said  provision  is  meant  to\r\nprotect responsible public servants against  the  institution  of  vexatious\r\ncriminal proceedings for offences alleged to have been  committed  by  them.\r\nThe learned Single Judge referred to P. Arulswami v.  State  of  Madras[13],\r\nMatajog Dube v.  H.C.  Bahri[14],  P.K.  Pradhan  v.  State  of  Sikkim[15],\r\nreproduced a passage from B. Saha v. M.S. Kochar[16], and came  to  hold  as\r\nfollows:-\r\n   So far as the commission of offence in this case  is  concerned,  the  very\r\nallegation would clearly reveal that it is not a case where the  allegations\r\nare in any other capacity than a public  servant.   The  allegation  against\r\nthe petitioner is that while being a public  servant,  he  had  committed  a\r\ncriminal breach of trust.  It is only in the  performance  of  the  official\r\nduty that the  petitioner  is  alleged  to  have  been  found  with  certain\r\ndeficiencies for which allegation of criminal breach of trust  as  well  has\r\nbeen made against him.  Certainly the facts in this  case  are  inextricably\r\nmingled with the official duty of the petitioner to be considered  severable\r\nto call for dispensing with the requirement of sanction   .\r\n\r\n5.    After so stating, the revisional court distinguished the  decision  in\r\nParas Nath Singh (supra)  which  was  relied  upon  by  the  prosecution  by\r\nstating thus:-\r\n   The aggrieved  person  in  the  said  case  has  faced  trial  for  alleged\r\ncommission of the offences punishable under Section 409, 420,  461  and  468\r\nIPC.  The Supreme Court in  this  case  has  drawn  difference  between  the\r\nofficial duty and doing something by public servant in  the  course  of  his\r\nservice.  It is observed that the section does  not  extend  its  protective\r\ncover to act or omission done by a public servant in service, but  restricts\r\nits scope of operation to only those acts or omissions, which are done by  a\r\npublic servant in discharge of official duty.  Even this observation of  the\r\nHon   ble Supreme Court would fully apply to the facts of  the  present  case.\r\nHere, the petitioner is alleged to have committed this offence not  only  as\r\na public servant but is stated to have done so in discharge of his  official\r\nduty.   In discharge of his official duty, the petitioner  was  required  to\r\nprotect stock, which he failed to do so and so he is asked  to  account  for\r\nthe same   .\r\n\r\n6.    The eventual conclusion recorded by the learned  Single  Judge  is  to\r\nthe following effect:-\r\n   Under normal circumstances, the offence under Sections 467/468/471 IPC  may\r\nbe of such a nature that requirement of  obtaining  sanction  under  Section\r\n197 CrPC may not be called for.  The offences in this case have been  inter-\r\nconnected with  the  main  offence  alleged  against  the  petitioner  under\r\nSection 409 IPC and it would clearly indicate that these offences could  not\r\nbe separately treated or dealt  with.   Requirement  of  obtaining  sanction\r\nwould be needed for an offence under Section 409 IPC and the  same  may  not\r\nbe separated from the remaining offences   .\r\n\r\n7.    After so stating, the learned Single Judge ruled that the  Corporation\r\nis a fully government-owned  and  financed  by  the  State  Government  and,\r\ntherefore, he is a public servant as per the definition  of  Section  21  of\r\nIPC and, therefore, his employment in the Corporation would confer  him  the\r\nstatus of public servant for which sanction is  necessary.   The  revisional\r\ncourt has not adverted to any of the aspects touching  merits  of  the  case\r\nand, therefore, we refrain from entering into the said arena.\r\n8.    Section 197(1) and  (2)  CrPC  which  are  relevant  for  the  present\r\npurpose are reproduced below:-\r\n   197. Prosecution of Judges and public servants.   (1) When any person who  is\r\nor was a Judge or Magistrate or a public  servant  not  removable  from  his\r\noffice save by or with the sanction of the  Government  is  accused  of  any\r\noffence alleged to have been committed by him while acting or purporting  to\r\nact in the discharge of his official duty, no court  shall  take  cognizance\r\nof such  offence  except  with  the  previous  sanction  save  as  otherwise\r\nprovided in the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013   \r\n\r\n(a) in the case of a person who is employed or, as the case may be,  was  at\r\nthe time of commission of the alleged offence employed, in  connection  with\r\nthe affairs of the Union, of the Central Government;\r\n\r\n(b) in the case of a person who is employed or, as the case may be,  was  at\r\nthe time of commission of the alleged offence employed, in  connection  with\r\nthe affairs of a State, of the State Government:\r\n\r\nProvided that where the alleged offence was committed by a  person  referred\r\nto in clause (b) during the period while a proclamation issued under  clause\r\n(1) of Article 356 of the Constitution was in force in a State,  clause  (b)\r\nwill apply as if for the expression    State  Government     occurring  therein,\r\nthe expression    Central Government    were substituted.\r\n\r\nExplanation.   For the removal  of  doubts  it  is  hereby  declared  that  no\r\nsanction shall be required in case  of  a  public  servant  accused  of  any\r\noffence alleged to have been committed under Section 166-A,  Section  166-B,\r\nSection 354, Section 354-A, Section 354-B,  Section  354-C,  Section  354-D,\r\nSection 370,  Section  375,  Section  376,  Section  376-A,  Section  376-C,\r\nSection 376-D or Section 509 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860).\r\n\r\n(2)   No Court shall take cognizance of any offence  alleged  to  have  been\r\ncommitted by any member of the Armed Forces of the  Union  while  acting  or\r\npurporting to act in the discharge of his official  duty,  except  with  the\r\nprevious sanction of the Central Government.   \r\n\r\n9.    In Matajog Dube (supra), certain complaints were alleged  against  the\r\nauthorized  officials  on  the  ground  that  the  officials  had  committed\r\noffences  punishable  under  Sections  323,  341,  342  and  109  IPC.   The\r\nofficials were arrayed as accused persons who were authorized to search  two\r\npremises in question.  The trial Magistrate discharged the  accused  persons\r\nfor want of sanction under Section 197 CrPC.  Similar order  was  passed  by\r\nanother trial Magistrate.  Both the orders were concurred with by  the  High\r\nCourt.  Be it noted two cases had arisen as two complaints were  filed.   It\r\nwas contended before  this  Court  that  the  act  of  criminal  assault  or\r\nwrongful confinement can never be regarded  as  act  done  while  acting  or\r\npurporting to act in the  discharge  of  official  duty  and  that  duty  is\r\nclearly defined in the statute.  The  Constitution  Bench  referred  to  two\r\ndecisions  of  the  Federal  Court  and  the  decisions  of  this  Court  in\r\nShreekantiah Ramayya Munipalli v. State of Bombay[17]  and  Amrik  Singh  v.\r\nState of Pepsu[18] and analyzing the earlier authorities opined that:-\r\n   The result of foregoing discussion is this:  There  must  be  a  reasonable\r\nconnection between the act and the discharge of official duty; the act  must\r\nbear such relation to the duty that the accused could lay a  reasonable  but\r\nnot a pretended or fanciful claim, that he did  it  in  the  course  of  the\r\nperformance of his duty   .\r\n\r\n10.   Thereafter, the  Court  adverted  to  the  determination  of  need  of\r\nsanction and the relevant  stage.   We  are  not  concerned  with  the  said\r\naspects in the present case.\r\n11.    In  Arulswami  (supra),  the  President  of  a  Panchayat  Board  was\r\nconvicted under Section 409 IPC by the High Court which had  overturned  the\r\ndecision of the lower court.  It was argued before the High Court  that  the\r\nprosecution  was  not  maintainable  for  want  of  sanction  by  the  State\r\nGovernment under Section 106 of the Madras Village Panchayats  Act   (Madras\r\nAct X of 1950).  The High Court held that no sanction of the Government  was\r\nnecessary as the appellant had ceased to hold the office of  the  President,\r\nwhen the prosecution was launched and  further  that  the  sanction  of  the\r\nCollector was sufficient in law.  That apart, this Court posed the  question\r\nwhether the sanction of the Government under Section 106 of the  Madras  Act\r\nwas necessary for the prosecution of the appellant  for  the  offence  under\r\nSection 409 IPC.  To appreciate the contention raised,  the  Court  referred\r\nto Section 197 CrPC.  The three-Judge Bench referred  to  the  decisions  in\r\nHori Ram Singh v. Emperor[19] and H.H.B. Gill v. The King[20].   The  three-\r\nJudge Bench quoted the observations of Lord  Simonds  made  in  H.H.B.  Gill\r\n(supra) in approving the statement of law made in Hori Ram  Singh   (supra).\r\nThe Court also took note of the  fact  that  the  decision  in  H.H.B.  Gill\r\n(supra) had been approved in Albert West Meads v.  The  King[21],  Phanindra\r\nChandra v. The King[22] and R. W. Mathams v. State of  West  Bengal[23]  and\r\neventually held:-\r\n   It is not therefore every  offence  committed  by  a  public  servant  that\r\nrequires sanction for prosecution under S. 197(1) of the Criminal  Procedure\r\nCode; nor even every act done by him while he is  actually  engaged  in  the\r\nperformance of his  official  duties;  but  if  the  act  complained  of  is\r\ndirectly concerned with his official  duties  so  that,  if  questioned,  it\r\ncould be claimed to have been done by virtue of the  office,  then  sanction\r\nwould be necessary.  It is the quality of the act that is important  and  if\r\nit falls within the scope and range of his official  duties  the  protection\r\ncontemplated by S. 197 of the Criminal Procedure  Code  will  be  attracted.\r\nAn office may be entirely unconnected with the official duty as such  or  it\r\nmay be committed within the  scope  of  the  official  duty.   Where  it  is\r\nunconnected with the official duty there can be no protection   .\r\n12.   The Court while arriving at the said conclusion also  placed  reliance\r\non Om Prakash Gupta v. State of U.P.[24] and ultimately came  to  hold  that\r\nthe sanction of the Government is  not  necessary  for  prosecution  of  the\r\naccused under Section 409 IPC.\r\n13.   The aforesaid two authorities  make  it  clear  that  no  sanction  is\r\nneeded to launch the prosecution for the offence  punishable  under  Section\r\n409 IPC.  As we notice from the impugned judgment, the learned Single  Judge\r\nhas been swayed away by what has been stated in B.  Saha  (supra).   In  the\r\nsaid  case,  the  appellants  had  sought  discharge  on  the  ground   that\r\ncognizance of the complaint had been taken without obtaining sanction  under\r\nSection 197 CrPC and Section 155 of the Customs Act, 1962.   The  Magistrate\r\nhad accepted the objection relying on the decision in  Shreekantiah  Ramayya\r\nMunipalli (supra).  The said order was challenged by the complainant  before\r\nthe High Court and the learned  Single  Judge,  after  elaborate  discussion\r\nopined that no sanction was required for the  prosecution  of  the  accused-\r\nappellants for the offence under Sections 120-B/409 IPC  because  they  were\r\ncertainly not acting in the discharge of their official  duties,  when  they\r\nmisappropriated the goods.  The three-Judge Bench analyzing  the  ambit  and\r\nscope of Section 197 CrPC opined that the  words     any  offence  alleged  to\r\nhave been committed by  him  while  acting  or  purporting  to  act  in  the\r\ndischarge of his official duty    employed in Section 197(1) of the Code,  are\r\ncapable of a narrow as well as a wide interpretation.   If  the  said  words\r\nare  construed  too  narrowly,  the  section  will  be  rendered  altogether\r\nsterile, for,    it is no part of an official duty to commit an  offence,  and\r\nnever can be   . The Court proceeded to observe that in the wider  sense,  the\r\nsaid words  will  take  under  their  umbrella  every  act  constituting  an\r\noffence, committed in the course  of  the  same  transaction  in  which  the\r\nofficial duty is performed  or  purports  to  be  performed  and  the  right\r\napproach to the import of these  words  lies  between  these  two  extremes.\r\nWhile on the one hand, it  is  not  every  offence  committed  by  a  public\r\nservant while engaged in the performance of  his  official  duty,  which  is\r\nentitled to the  protection  of  Section  197(1),  an  act  constituting  an\r\noffence, directly and reasonably  connected  with  his  official  duty  will\r\nrequire sanction for  prosecution  under  the  said  provision.   The  Court\r\nreferred to the observations of Ramaswami,  J.,  in  Baijnath  v.  State  of\r\nM.P.[25], which is to the following effect:-\r\n   it is the quality of the act that is important, and if it falls within  the\r\nscope and range of his  official  duties,  the  protection  contemplated  by\r\nSection 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code will be attracted   .\r\n\r\n      After  The Managing Director of the Corporation had written a letter on 28.6.1989 to the concerned police authority to register a case against the first respondent for offences punishable under&nbsp;Sections 409/467/468&nbsp;and&nbsp;471&nbsp;of the IPC or any other appropriate provision of law. During investigation, the investigating agency found that the accused who was working as a Godown Assistant in the Corporation had misappropriated 11 gunny bales value of which was Rs.38,841/-; that he had tampered with the record of the department; and accordingly the police authorities filed the charge-sheet for the aforesaid offences before the court of competent Judicial Magistrate. The learned Magistrate on the basis of evidence brought on record, found that the prosecution had been able to bring home the guilt against the accused and accordingly sentenced him to suffer rigorous imprisonment for three years under&nbsp;Section 467&nbsp;and&nbsp;409&nbsp;IPC and two years under&nbsp;Section 468/471&nbsp;IPC with separate default clauses. The judgment of conviction and order of sentence was assailed in appeal before the learned Session Judge, Firozpur and the matter was finally heard by the learned Additional Session Judge, who appreciating the evidence on record, concurred with the conviction but modified the sentence of three years imposed under&nbsp;Section 409&nbsp;and&nbsp;467&nbsp;IPC to two years.Being dissatisfied, the first respondent preferred Criminal Revision No. 359/2001 in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh. Before the revisional court, the only contention that was raised pertained to non- obtaining of sanction under&nbsp;Section 197&nbsp;CrPC.The Supreme Court in the case had drawn difference between the official duty and doing something by public servant in the course of his service.&nbsp;Here, the petitioner was alleged to have committed the offence not only as a public servant but was stated to have done so in discharge of his official duty. In discharge of his official duty, the petitioner was required to protect stock, which he failed to do so and so he was asked to account for the sameâ€.In view of the aforesaid analysis, the irresistible conclusion was that the respondents were not entitled to have the protective umbrella of&nbsp;Section 197&nbsp;CrPC and, therefore, the High Court has erred in setting aside the conviction and sentence on the ground that the trial is vitiated in the absence of sanction. Consequently, Supreme Court allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment and order passed by the High Court and remit the matter to the High Court to decide the revision petition in accordance with law. Appeals Allowed','M/S. Techno Shares & Stocks Ltd Vs Commissioner Of Income Tax-Iv S.H. KAPADIA, CJI\r\n\r\n1.    Leave granted.\r\n\r\n2.    In this batch of cases the question which arises for\r\n\r\ndetermination       is:   whether    BSE    Membership           Card   can   be\r\n\r\nconsidered     an    intangible         asset   for        the    purpose      of\r\n\r\ndepreciation    under      Section      32(1)(ii)     of    the    Income     Tax\r\n\r\nAct, 1961 (for short \"the 1961 Act\")?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFacts in M/s Techno Shares &amp; Stocks Ltd. [Lead matter]\r\n\r\n3.    In this case, we are concerned with the Assessment\r\n\r\nYears 1999-2000, 2000-2001, 2001-2002 and 2002-2003. The\r\n\r\nassessee   company        filed   its    Return     of     income       for   the\r\n \r\n\r\nAssessment      Year    1999-2000         disclosing     a    loss      of    Rs.\r\n\r\n10,77,276/-. The return was processed under Section 143(1)\r\n\r\non November 8, 2000. The case stood reopened under Section\r\n\r\n147 and Notice u/s 148 stood issued to the assessee on\r\n\r\n16.7.2002. The assessee filed its return of income under\r\n\r\nprotest. The assessee filed its return of income pursuant\r\n\r\nto the Notice u/s 148 once again declaring loss of Rs.\r\n\r\n10,77,276/-, the same as was in the original return of\r\n\r\nincome. The main reason for reopening of assessment under\r\n\r\nSection 147 was the claim of depreciation by the assessee\r\n\r\non BSE membership card amounting to Rs. 23,65,000/-. The\r\n\r\nclaim of depreciation of the assessee was based on Section\r\n\r\n32(1)(ii) which stood inserted by Finance (No. 2) Act,\r\n\r\n1998 w.e.f. 1.4.1999. However, the said Section deals with\r\n\r\nclaim    for   depreciation          of   items   acquired    on       or    after\r\n\r\n1.4.1998.      The assessee claimed before the A.O. that the\r\n\r\nBSE     membership     card    is     a    \"licence\"     or   \"business         or\r\n\r\ncommercial right of similar nature\" u/s 32(1)(ii) and is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, an intangible asset eligible for depreciation\r\n\r\nu/s 32(1)(ii) which submission was not accepted by the\r\n\r\nA.O.      It   was   held     that    membership    is   only      a   personal\r\n\r\npermission which is non-transferable and which does not\r\n\r\ndevolve automatically on legal heirs and, therefore, it is\r\n \r\n\r\nnot a privately owned asset.               That, there is no ownership\r\n\r\nof an asset and that what ultimately can be sold is only a\r\n\r\nRight to Nomination.           Further, according to the A.O., in\r\n\r\nthe case of BSE membership, there is no obsolescence, wear\r\n\r\nand tear or diminution in value by its use, hence, the\r\n\r\nassessee     was   not     entitled        to    claim     depreciation            u/s\r\n\r\n32(1)(ii).     This decision of the A.O. stood affirmed by\r\n\r\nC.I.T. (A) in the appeal filed by the assessee.\r\n\r\n4.    Aggrieved      by    the      said    decision       of    CIT    (A),       the\r\n\r\nassessee   carried       the   matter      in    appeal    to    the        Tribunal\r\n\r\nwhich took the view that since the assessee had acquired a\r\n\r\nright to trade on the floor of BSE through the membership\r\n\r\ncard, it was not entitled to depreciation u/s 32(1)(ii) of\r\n\r\nthe 1961 Act.        That, the said Card is a capital asset\r\n\r\nthrough    which   right       to   trade       on   the   floor       of    BSE    is\r\n\r\nacquired     and   since       it   is     intangible       asset       the     said\r\n\r\nassessee was entitled to depreciation u/s 32(1)(ii).\r\n\r\n5.    Against the said decision, the Department carried\r\n\r\nthe matter in appeal to the High Court which came to the\r\n\r\nconclusion,    following        certain     decisions       of     this       Court,\r\n\r\nthat the BSE membership card is only a personal privilege\r\n\r\ngranted to a member to trade in shares on the floor of the\r\n\r\nStock Exchange; that, such a privilege cannot be equated\r\n \r\n\r\nwith the expression \"licence\" or \"any other business or\r\n\r\ncommercial rights of similar nature\" u/s 32(1)(ii); that,\r\n\r\nthere     is    a   difference       between    acquiring       a    know-how,\r\n\r\npatent, copyright or trademark and acquiring a licence to\r\n\r\nuse     such     know-how,     patent,     copyright,       trademark         or\r\n\r\nfranchise;       that   the   expression       \"business    or      commercial\r\n\r\nrights of similar nature\" in Section 32(1)(ii) of the 1961\r\n\r\nAct   would      take   its    colour    from    the    preceding         words,\r\n\r\nnamely,        know-how,      patent,    copyright,        trademark         and\r\n\r\nfranchise which belong to a class of intellectual property\r\n\r\nrights and applying the rule of ejusdem generis, the High\r\n\r\nCourt held that the expression \"licence\" as well as the\r\n\r\nexpression       \"business     and    commercial       rights       of   similar\r\n\r\nnature\" in Section 32(1)(ii) of the 1961 Act are referable\r\n\r\nto IPRs such as know-how, patent, copyright, trademark and\r\n\r\nfranchise and since the BSE membership card does not fall\r\n\r\nin any of the above categories, the claim for depreciation\r\n\r\nwas not admissible on the BSE membership card acquired by\r\n\r\nthe   assessee      u/s    32(1)(ii).     Consequently,         the      appeals\r\n\r\nfiled by the Department stood allowed, hence, these civil\r\n\r\nappeals.\r\n\r\nImportance of BSE:\r\n\r\n6.       BSE is recognized by the Government of India under\r\n \r\n\r\nSecurities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956. Approximately\r\n\r\n70000 deals are executed on a daily basis. There are about\r\n\r\n3500     companies    which     are    listed    on   BSE.     The     market\r\n\r\ncapitalization of the BSE is Rs. 5 trillion. The main aim\r\n\r\nand object of the BSE is to provide a market place for the\r\n\r\npurchase    and   sale     of   securities.      It   aims     to    promote,\r\n\r\ndevelop and maintain a well regulated market for dealing\r\n\r\nin   securities      and   to   safeguard       the   interests       of    the\r\n\r\nmembers and the investing public having dealings in the\r\n\r\nExchange. It helps industrial development of the country\r\n\r\nthrough resources mobilization. It is set up to establish\r\n\r\nand promote \"just practices\" in securities transactions.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1996, the BSE constituted a Trade Guarantee\r\n\r\nScheme    under    which    all    trades    carried     out    on     online\r\n\r\ntrading    are    guaranteed      by   the   clearing    house       of    BSE.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, a depository has been set up as a joint venture\r\n\r\nbetween BSE and Bank of India etc. BSE has introduced\r\n\r\ntrading also in fixed income securities to give impetus to\r\n\r\ntrading in debentures and corporate debt instruments to\r\n\r\nincrease trading in Government owned securities.\r\n\r\nQuestion arising in the Present Matters:\r\n\r\n7.     Is depreciation allowable on the cost of a Stock\r\n\r\n       Exchange Membership Card under Section 32(1)(ii)\r\n \r\n\r\n     of the Income Tax Act, 1961, which was enacted and\r\n\r\n     inserted by Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnswer to the above Question:\r\n\r\n8.

It is relevant  to point out that the acquisition \r\n\r\n              proceedings under the Act, are based on the principal of \r\n\r\n              eminent   domain   and   the   only   protection   given   to   the \r\n\r\n              person   whose   land   is   sought   to   be   acquired   is   an \r\n\r\n              opportunity under Section 5-A of the Act to convince the \r\n\r\n              enquiring authority that the purpose for which the land is \r\n\r\n              sought   to   be  acquired   is   in  fact   is   not   a  public   purpose \r\n\r\n              and is only purported to be one in the guise of a public \r\n\r\n              purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      It   is   relevant   to   mention   here   that   excluding   the \r\n\r\n              enquiry   under   Section   5-A   can   only   be   an   exception \r\n\r\n              where the urgency cannot brook any delay.  The enquiry \r\n\r\n              provides an opportunity to the owner of land to convince \r\n\r\n              the authorities concerned that the land in question is not \r\n\r\n              suitable for purpose for which it is sought to be acquired \r\n\r\n              or   the   same   sought   to   be   acquired   for   the   collateral \r\n\r\n              purposes.    It   is   pertinent   to   mention   here   that   the \r\n\r\n              respondents  No.  1  &amp;  2  without   the  application  of  mind \r\n\r\n              dispensed   with   the   enquiry   on   the   ground   of   urgency \r\n\r\n              invoking the power conferred by Section 17 (1) or (2) of \r\n\r\n              the   Act.     Further,   the   respondent   No.   1   &amp;   2   without \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplication of mind did not considered the survey report \r\n\r\nof the abadi of the village Makaura where the entire land \r\n\r\nis being used for the purpose of residence and grazing of \r\n\r\ncattle\'s in Khasra No. 394.  Further, the petitioners were \r\n\r\nsurprised to find that their land have not been included in \r\n\r\nthe   Abadi   irrespective   the   same   is   in   use   for   habitable \r\n\r\nand   keeping   the   cattle   and   other   uses.     The   petitioners \r\n\r\nhave   constructed   their   houses   and   using   the   same   for \r\n\r\ntheir   residence   and   keep   their   cattle\'s   and   agricultural \r\n\r\nproduce.    The   survey   report   clearly   shows   that   the \r\n\r\nimpugned Khasra  No. 394 is in use  for residence.    The \r\n\r\nreport in respect of the land in question falling in Khasra \r\n\r\nNo.   394   given   by   the   respondent   No.   4   vide \r\n\r\ncommunication   dated   26th  March,   2007   is   annexed   as \r\n\r\nAnnexure 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n16.     That   the   said   notification   under   Section   4   of   the \r\n\r\nAct   issued   by   the   respondent   No.   1   and   2   is   without \r\n\r\napplication   of   mind   and   there   was   no   urgency   in   the \r\n\r\nacquisition   of   land,   for   the   planned   industrial \r\n\r\ndevelopment, as the land, as per the master plan - 2021 \r\n\r\nthe   land   of   the   village   Makaura   is   reserved   for \r\n\r\n\"residential\"   of   which   the   respondent   No.   2   invoked \r\n\r\nSection 17 (1) and subsection 4 of the Act by dispensing \r\n\r\nwith an enquiry under Section 5A of the Act.   The said \r\n\r\naction   on   the   part   of   the   respondents   are   un-warranted \r\n\r\nand is in gross violation of Article 14,19, 21 and 300A of \r\n\r\nthe constitution.   The such illegal  act on the part of the \r\n\r\nrespondents show mala fide and their oblique motive to \r\n\r\ndeprive   the   owners   from  their   houses   in   order   to   fulfill \r\n\r\ntheir political obligations/promise to the private builders \r\n\r\nby   taking   the   shelter   of   section   17   of   the   Act   by \r\n\r\ndispensing with the enquiry under Section 5-A of the Act \r\n\r\nas well as overlooked purpose as stipulated in the Master \r\n\r\nPlan   2021   which   is   any   way   do   not   require   any   urgent \r\n\r\nattention. \r\n\r\n\r\nA.      That the whole acquisition proceedings   are void, \r\n\r\nunconstitutional,   tainted   with   mala   fide,   abuse   of \r\n\r\nauthority   and   power,   non-application   of   mind,   and   as \r\n\r\nsuch, liable to be quashed as violative of Articles 14,19 \r\n\r\nand 300-A of the Constitution of India. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            F.      That   the   purpose   stated   in   the   notification   under \r\n\r\n            Section   4   and   declaration   under   section   6   by   invoking \r\n\r\n            section   17   is   presently   non-existent   and   thus   the \r\n\r\n            notification   is   bad   in   law.   There   is   no   urgency   for   the \r\n\r\n            invocation   when   the   land   is   to   be   acquired   for   planned \r\n\r\n            development for the purpose of setting residential colony. \r\n\r\n            The impugned             notification   is   without   any   authority \r\n\r\n            of law and volatile of Article 300-A of the Constitution \r\n\r\n            of   India,   which   limits   the   power   to   acquire   land   to   the \r\n\r\n            authority under the Land Acquisition Act.  Therefore, the \r\n\r\n            notification in question is bad in law.\"\r\n\r\n                                                              (emphasis supplied)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7.    The  High  Court negatived  the  appellants\'   challenge  at the  threshold \r\n\r\n\r\nmainly on the ground that the averments contained in the petition were not \r\n\r\n\r\nsupported by a proper affidavit.  This is evident from the following portions \r\n\r\n\r\nof the impugned order:\r\n\r\n\r\n            \"Here the petitioners neither have pleaded that there exist \r\n\r\n            no material before  the State Government to come to the \r\n\r\n            conclusion that the enquiry under Section 5-A should be \r\n\r\n            dispensed with by invoking Section 17(4) of the Act nor \r\n\r\n            the learned counsel for the petitioners could place before \r\n\r\n            us   any   such   averment   in   the   writ   petition.   Though,   in \r\n\r\n            para-11 of the writ petition, an averment has been made \r\n\r\n            that the respondents no. 1 and 2 without the application \r\n\r\n            of   mind   dispensed   with   the   enquiry   on   the   ground   of \r\n\r\n            urgency  invoking the power conferred by Section  17(1) \r\n\r\n            or (2) of the Act, but in the affidavit, the said paragraph \r\n\r\n            has   been   sworn   on   the   basis   of   perusal   of   record. \r\n\r\n            Similarly   in   para   16   of   the   writ   petition,   the   only \r\n\r\n            averment contained therein is as under:\r\n\r\n\r\n            \"16. That the said notification under Section 4 of the \r\n\r\n            Act   issued   by   the   respondent   No.1   and   2   is   without \r\n\r\n            application of mind and there was no urgency in the \r\n\r\n            acquisition   of   land,   for   the   planned   industrial \r\n\r\n            development, as the land, as per the master plan-2021 \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               the   land   of   the   village   Makaura   is   reserved   for \r\n\r\n               \"residential\"   of   which   the   respondent   No.2   invoked \r\n\r\n               Section   17(1)   and   sub-section   4   of   the   Act   by \r\n\r\n               dispensing with an enquiry under Section 5-A of the \r\n\r\n               Act. The said action on the part of the respondents are \r\n\r\n               un-warranted   and   is   in   gross   violation   of   Article \r\n\r\n               14,19,21   and   300A   of   the   Constitution.     The   such \r\n\r\n               illegal   act   on  the   part   of  the  respondents   show   mala \r\n\r\n               fide   and   their   oblique   motive   to   deprive   the   owners \r\n\r\n               from   their   houses   in   order   to   fulfill   their   political \r\n\r\n               obligations/ promise to the private builders by taking \r\n\r\n               the shelter of Section 17 of the Act by dispensing with \r\n\r\n               the  enquiry  under Section   5-A  of the  Act as  well  as \r\n\r\n               overlooked   purpose   as   stipulated   in   the   Master   Plan \r\n\r\n               2021   which   is   any   way   do   not   require   any   urgent \r\n\r\n               attention.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n               However, in the affidavit, this para has not been sworn at \r\n\r\n               all   and   in   any   case   with   respect   to   dispensation   of \r\n\r\n               enquiry under Section 5-A by invoking  Section 17(4) of \r\n\r\n               the Act nothing has been said except that the exercise of \r\n\r\n               power is violative of Articles 14,19, 21 and 300-A of the \r\n\r\n               Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n               We, therefore, do not find any occasion even to call upon \r\n\r\n               the   respondents   to   file   a   counter   affidavit   placing   on \r\n\r\n               record,   the   material   if   any   for   exercising   power   under \r\n\r\n               Section   17(1)   and   (4)   of   the   Act   in   the   absence   of   any \r\n\r\n               relevant   pleading   or   material   and   the   question   of \r\n\r\n               requiring the respondents to produce the original record \r\n\r\n               in this regard also does not arise.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8.     The   High   Court   distinguished   the   judgment   of   this   Court   in  Om \r\n\r\n\r\nPrakash   v.   State   of   U.P.  (1998)   6   SCC   1,   albeit   without   assigning   any \r\n\r\n\r\ncogent   reason,   relied   upon   the   judgments   of   the   Division   Benches   in \r\n\r\n\r\nKshama Sahkari Avas Samiti Ltd. v. State of U.P.  2007 (1) AWC 327, \r\n\r\n\r\nJasraj Singh v. State of U.P. 2008 (8) ADJ 329 and Jagriti Sahkari Avas \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSamiti Ltd. Ghaziabad v. State of U.P. 2008 (9) ADJ 43 and held that the \r\n\r\n\r\ndecision of the Government to invoke Section 17(1) cannot be subjected to \r\n\r\n\r\njudicial   review.   The   High   Court   also   rejected   the   appellants\'   plea   that   in \r\n\r\n\r\nterms  of  the  policy  framed by  the   State   Government, the  land   covered   by \r\n\r\n\r\nabadi cannot be acquired by observing that no material has been placed on \r\n\r\n\r\nrecord   to   show   that   the   policy   framed   in   1991   was   still   continuing.     To \r\n\r\n\r\nbuttress   this   conclusion,   the   High   Court   relied   upon   the   judgment   of   this \r\n\r\n\r\nCourt in Anand Buttons Limited v. State of Haryana (2005) 9 SCC 164.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9.      By an order dated 29.10.2010, this Court, after taking cognizance of \r\n\r\n\r\nthe fact that the respondents did not get opportunity to file reply to the writ \r\n\r\n\r\npetition, directed them to do so. Thereupon, Shri Harnam Singh, Additional \r\n\r\n\r\nDistrict   Magistrate   (Land   Acquisition)/Officer   on   Special   Duty   (Land \r\n\r\n\r\nAcquisition) NOIDA, District Gautam Budh Nagar filed counter affidavit on \r\n\r\n\r\nbehalf   of   respondent   Nos.1   to   3.     In   paragraph   10   of   his   affidavit,   Shri \r\n\r\n\r\nHarnam  Singh   has   attempted   to   justify   invoking   of   the   urgency   clause   by \r\n\r\n\r\nmaking the following assertions:\r\n\r\n\r\n                \"That   in   invoking   the   urgency   clause   the   State \r\n\r\n                Government   has   taken   into   consideration   the   following \r\n\r\n                factors:-\r\n\r\n\r\n                i)      Greater   Noida   Industrial   Development   Authority \r\n\r\n                was   constituted   under   the   U.P.

The   acquired   land   was \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             urgently   required   by   the   Development   Authority   for \r\n\r\n             planned Industrial Development of the area.\r\n\r\n\r\n             ii)     That the land in the adjoining villages were already \r\n\r\n             acquired   by   the   Greater   Noida   Industrial   Development \r\n\r\n             Authority.  Thus, the acquired land was urgently required \r\n\r\n             for   continuity   of   infrastructure   services   and   planned \r\n\r\n             Industrial   Development   of   the   Area.     If,   the   proposed \r\n\r\n             land   was   not   acquired   immediately   and   delay   in   this \r\n\r\n             regard would lead to encroachments and would adversely \r\n\r\n             affect the Planned Industrial Development of the Area.\r\n\r\n\r\n             iii)    That   the   acquired   land   was   required   for   overall \r\n\r\n             development   i.e.   construction   of   roads,   laying   of \r\n\r\n             sewerages,   providing   electricity   etc.   in   the   area   and  the \r\n\r\n             said   scheme   has   been   duly   approved   by   the   state \r\n\r\n             government.\r\n\r\n\r\n             iv)     That   the   acquired   land   consists   of   246   plots \r\n\r\n             numbers with 392 recorded tenure holders.

Shri   Manoj   Kumar   Singh,   Tehsildar   filed   a   separate   affidavit   on \r\n\r\n\r\nbehalf of Respondent No.4 and justified the invoking of urgency clause by \r\n\r\n\r\nasserting that large tracts of land were acquired for industrial development \r\n\r\n\r\nof the district.  According to him, as per the policy of industrial development \r\n\r\n\r\nof   the   State   Government,   the   land   is   required   to   be   allotted   to   industrial \r\n\r\n\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\n\r\n11.     On   8.11.2010,  Shri   Dinesh   Dwivedi  learned   senior   counsel   for   the \r\n\r\n\r\nState   made   a   request   for   permission   to   file   additional   affidavit   with   some \r\n\r\n\r\ndocuments. His request was accepted.   Thereafter, the respondents filed an \r\n\r\n\r\naffidavit   of   Shri   Sushil   Kumar   Chaubey,   Tehsildar,   Land   Acquisition, \r\n\r\n\r\nGautam Budh Nagar along with eight documents of which seven have been \r\n\r\n\r\ncollectively marked as Annexure A-1.     The first of the documents marked \r\n\r\n\r\nAnnexure A-1 is copy of letter dated 25.2.2008 sent by the Commissioner \r\n\r\n\r\nand Director, Directorate of Land Acquisition, Revenue Board, U.P. to the \r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial   Secretary,   Industrial   Development   on   the   subject   of   issuance   of \r\n\r\n\r\nnotification   under   Sections   4   and   17   of   the   Act   for   acquisition   of   lands \r\n\r\n\r\nmeasuring 205.0288 hectares of village Makora.  The second document is an \r\n\r\n\r\nundated   letter   signed   by   Deputy   Chief   Executive   Officer,   Greater   Noida, \r\n\r\n\r\nCollector,  Gautam Budh Nagar and four other  officers/officials.    The  next \r\n\r\n\r\ndocument has been  described as comments/certificate on the issues raised in \r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment Order No.5261/77-4-06-251N/06 dated 21.12.2006 with regard \r\n\r\n\r\nto   proposal   for   acquisition   of   205.0288   hectares   lands   in   village   Makora. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis   document   is   accompanied   by   seven   forms   containing   various \r\n\r\n\r\nparticulars.  The third document is communication dated 29.10.2007 sent by \r\n\r\n\r\nthe   Commissioner,   Meerut   Division,   Meerut   to   the   District   Magistrate, \r\n\r\n\r\nGautam Budh Nagar conveying  the consent  of the Divisional Land Utility \r\n\r\n\r\nCommittee  for the acquisition of   lands of five villages including Makora. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter is accompanied by minutes of the meeting of the Divisional Land \r\n\r\n\r\nUtility Committee held on 29.10.2007.  The fifth document is form No.43A-\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  The sixth document is communication dated 22.2.2008 sent by Collector, \r\n\r\n\r\nLand Acquisition/Special Land Acquisition Officer, Greater Noida.  The last \r\n\r\n\r\ndocument which forms part of Annexure A-1 is form No.16 showing the list \r\n\r\n\r\nof properties having constructions etc.  Annexure A-2 is copy of letter dated \r\n\r\n\r\n31.10.2008   sent   by   the   Director,   Directorate   of   Land   Acquisition   to   the \r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial Secretary, Industrial Development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12.     Shri   N.P.Singh,   learned   counsel   for   the   appellants   argued   that   the \r\n\r\n\r\nimpugned   order   is   liable   to   be   set   aside   because   the   High   Court   failed   to \r\n\r\n\r\nconsider   the   issues   raised   in   the   writ   petition   in   a   correct   perspective. \r\n\r\n\r\nLearned counsel submitted that the appellants had specifically pleaded that \r\n\r\n\r\nthere was no valid ground to invoke the urgency clause contained in Section \r\n\r\n\r\n17(1) and to dispense with the application of Section 5-A but the High Court \r\n\r\n\r\ndid not even call upon the respondents to file counter affidavit and brushed \r\n\r\n\r\naside   the   challenge   to   the   acquisition   proceeding   on   a   wholly   untenable \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npremise  that  the  affidavit filed in support of the writ  petition was laconic. \r\n\r\n\r\nLearned counsel further argued that the purpose for which land was acquired \r\n\r\n\r\ni.e. planned industrial development of the district did not justify invoking of \r\n\r\n\r\nthe urgency provisions and denial of opportunity to the appellants and other \r\n\r\n\r\nland owners to file objections under Section 5-A (1) and to be heard by the \r\n\r\n\r\nCollector   in   terms   of   the   mandate   of   Section   5-A   (2).   In   support   of   his \r\n\r\n\r\nargument,  learned  counsel   relied   upon  the   judgments  in  Narayan   Govind \r\n\r\n\r\nGavate v. State of Maharashtra (1977) 1 SCC 133 and Esso Fabs Private \r\n\r\n\r\nLimited v. State of Haryana  (2009) 2 SCC 377. Another argument of the \r\n\r\n\r\nlearned   counsel   is   that   the   High   Court   misdirected   itself   in   summarily \r\n\r\n\r\ndismissing the writ petition ignoring the substantive plea of discrimination \r\n\r\n\r\nraised by the appellants. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13.     Shri   Dinesh   Dwivedi,   learned   senior   counsel   appearing   for   the \r\n\r\n\r\nrespondents urged that this Court should   not nullify the acquisition at the \r\n\r\n\r\ninstance of the appellants because the pleadings filed before the High Court \r\n\r\n\r\nwere not supported by proper affidavit. Shri Dwivedi argued that the High \r\n\r\n\r\nCourt   was   justified   in   non-suiting   the   appellants   because   they   did   not \r\n\r\n\r\nproduce   any   evidence   to   effectively   challenge   the   invoking   of   urgency \r\n\r\n\r\nprovision   contained   in   Section   17(1).   Learned   senior   counsel   emphasized \r\n\r\n\r\nthat the satisfaction envisaged in Section 17(1) is purely subjective and the \r\n\r\n\r\nCourt cannot review the decision taken by the State Government to invoke \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   urgency   clause.   He   submitted   that   planned   industrial   development   of \r\n\r\n\r\nDistrict   Gautam   Budh   Nagar   is   being   undertaken   in   consonance   with   the \r\n\r\n\r\npolicy decision taken by the State Government and the appellants cannot be \r\n\r\n\r\nheard to make a grievance against the acquisition of their land because they \r\n\r\n\r\nwill be duly compensated. In support of his argument, Shri Dwivedi relied \r\n\r\n\r\nupon the judgment of this Court in State of U.P. v. Pista Devi (1986) 4 SCC \r\n\r\n\r\n251 and Chameli Singh v. State of U.P. (1996) 2 SCC 549.  Learned senior \r\n\r\n\r\ncounsel further submitted that the appellants\' land cannot be released from \r\n\r\n\r\nacquisition   because   that   will   result   in   frustrating   the   objective   of   planned \r\n\r\n\r\nindustrial   development  of  the  district.   On the  issue of discrimination,  Shri \r\n\r\n\r\nDwivedi argued that even  if the land belonging to some persons has been \r\n\r\n\r\nillegally   left   out   from   acquisition,   the   appellants   are   not   entitled   to   a \r\n\r\n\r\ndirection that their land should also be released.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14.     The first issue which needs to be addressed is whether the High Court \r\n\r\n\r\nwas justified in non-suiting  the appellants on the ground that they had not \r\n\r\n\r\nraised a specific plea supported by a proper affidavit to question the decision \r\n\r\n\r\ntaken by the State Government to invoke Section 17(1) and 17(4) of the Act. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall also consider an ancillary issue   as to whether the appellants had \r\n\r\n\r\nsucceeded   in prima facie proving   that there was no justification to invoke \r\n\r\n\r\nthe urgency clause and to dispense with the inquiry envisaged under Section \r\n\r\n\r\n5-A.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15.           At   the   outset,   we   record   our   disapproval   of   the   casual   manner   in \r\n\r\n\r\nwhich the High Court disposed of the writ petition without even calling upon \r\n\r\n\r\nthe respondents to file counter affidavit and produce the relevant records. A \r\n\r\n\r\nreading of the averments contained in paragraphs 11 and 16 and grounds A \r\n\r\n\r\nand F of the writ petition, which have been extracted hereinabove   coupled \r\n\r\n\r\nwith the appellants\' assertion that the acquisition of their land was vitiated \r\n\r\n\r\ndue to discrimination inasmuch as  land belonging to influential persons had \r\n\r\n\r\nbeen left out from acquisition, but their land was acquired in total disregard \r\n\r\n\r\nof the policy of the State Government to leave out  land on which dwelling \r\n\r\n\r\nunits had already been constructed, show that they had succeeded in making \r\n\r\n\r\nout   a   strong   case   for   deeper   examination   of   the   issues   raised   in   the   writ \r\n\r\n\r\npetition     and   the  High   Court    committed   serious   error   by   summarily   non-\r\n\r\n\r\nsuiting them. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16.     The history of land acquisition legislations shows that in Eighteenth \r\n\r\n\r\nCentury, Bengal Regulation I of 1824, Act I of 1850, Act VI of 1857, Act \r\n\r\n\r\nXXII of 1863, Act X of 1870, Bombay Act No. XXVIII of 1839, Bombay \r\n\r\n\r\nAct No. XVII of 1850, Madras Act No. XX of 1852 and Madras Act No.1 of \r\n\r\n\r\n1854 were enacted to facilitate the acquisition of land and other immovable \r\n\r\n\r\nproperties for roads, canals, and other public purposes by paying the amount \r\n\r\n\r\nto be determined by the arbitrators.  In 1870, the Land Acquisition Act was \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenacted   to   provide   for   proper   valuation   of   the   acquired   land.     That   Act \r\n\r\n\r\nenvisaged that if the person having interest in   land is not agreeable to part \r\n\r\n\r\nwith possession by accepting the amount offered to him, then the Collector \r\n\r\n\r\nmay   make   a   reference   to   the   Civil   Court.   The   1870   Act   also   envisaged \r\n\r\n\r\nappointment   of   assessors   to   assist   the   Civil   Court.     If   the   Court   and   the \r\n\r\n\r\nassessor   did not  agree  on  the amount  then an  appeal  could be  filed  in  the \r\n\r\n\r\nHigh   Court.     This   mechanism   proved   ineffective   because   lot   of   time   was \r\n\r\n\r\nconsumed   in   litigation.     With   a   view   to   overcome   this   problem,   the \r\n\r\n\r\nlegislature   enacted   the   Act   on   the   line   of   the   English   Lands   Clauses \r\n\r\n\r\nConsolidation   Act,   1845.     However,   the   land   owners   or   persons   having \r\n\r\n\r\ninterest in land did not have any say in the acquisition process either under \r\n\r\n\r\npre-1984   legislations   or   the   1984   Act   (un-amended).   They   could   raise \r\n\r\n\r\nobjection   only   qua   the   amount   of   compensation   and   matters   connected \r\n\r\n\r\ntherewith.     The   absence   of   opportunity   to   raise   objection   against   the \r\n\r\n\r\nacquisition of land was resented by those who were deprived of their land. \r\n\r\n\r\nTo redress this grievance, Section 5A was inserted in the Act by amending \r\n\r\n\r\nAct No.38 of 1923.  The statement of Objects and Reasons contained in Bill \r\n\r\n\r\nNo.29 of 1923, which led to enactment of the amending Act read as under:\r\n\r\n\r\n                \"The   Land   Acquisition   Act   I   of   1894   does   not   provide \r\n\r\n                that   persons   having   an   interest   in   land   which   it   is \r\n\r\n                proposed to acquire, shall have the right of objecting to \r\n\r\n                such   acquisition;   nor   is   Government   bound   to   enquire \r\n\r\n                into   and   consider   any   objections   that   may   reach   them. \r\n\r\n                The   object   of   this   Bill   is   to   provide   that   a   Local \r\n\r\n                Government shall not declare, under Section 6 of the Act, \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            that any land is needed for a public purpose unless time \r\n\r\n            has   been   allowed   after   the   notification   under   Section   4 \r\n\r\n            for persons interested in the land to put in objections and \r\n\r\n            for   such   objections   to   be   considered   by   the   Local \r\n\r\n            Government.\"   \r\n\r\n\r\n17.             The   Act,   which   was   enacted   more   than   116   years   ago   for \r\n\r\n\r\nfacilitating   the   acquisition   of   land   and   other   immovable   properties   for \r\n\r\n\r\nconstruction of roads, canals, railways etc., has been frequently used in \r\n\r\n\r\nthe   post   independence   era   for   different   public   purposes   like   laying   of \r\n\r\n\r\nroads,     construction   of   bridges,   dams   and   buildings   of   various   public \r\n\r\n\r\nestablishments/institutions,   planned   development   of   urban   areas, \r\n\r\n\r\nproviding   of   houses   to   different   sections   of   the   society   and   for \r\n\r\n\r\ndeveloping residential colonies/sectors.  However, in the recent years, the \r\n\r\n\r\ncountry has witnessed a new phenomena.  Large tracts of land have been \r\n\r\n\r\nacquired in   rural parts of the country in the name of development and \r\n\r\n\r\ntransferred   to   private   entrepreneurs,   who   have   utilized   the   same   for \r\n\r\n\r\nconstruction   of   multi-storied   complexes,   commercial   centers   and   for \r\n\r\n\r\nsetting up industrial units.   Similarly, large scale acquisitions have been \r\n\r\n\r\nmade on behalf of the companies by invoking the provisions contained in \r\n\r\n\r\nPart VII of the Act. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18.       The resultant effect of these acquisitions is that the land owners, \r\n\r\n\r\nwho  were doing  agricultural   operations  and  other  ancillary   activities   in \r\n\r\n\r\nrural   areas,   have   been   deprived   of   the   only   source   of   their   livelihood. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMajority of them do not have any idea about their constitutional and legal \r\n\r\n\r\nrights,   which   can   be   enforced   by   availing   the   constitutional   remedies \r\n\r\n\r\nunder   Articles   32   and   226   of   the   Constitution.     They   reconcile   with \r\n\r\n\r\ndeprivation of land by accepting the amount of compensation offered by \r\n\r\n\r\nthe   Government   and   by   thinking   that   it   is   their   fate   and   destiny \r\n\r\n\r\ndetermined   by   God.     Even   those   who   get   semblance   of   education   are \r\n\r\n\r\nneither   conversant   with   the   functioning   of  the  State   apparatus   nor   they \r\n\r\n\r\ncan access the records prepared by the concerned authorities as a prelude \r\n\r\n\r\nto the acquisition of   land by invoking Section 4 with or without the aid \r\n\r\n\r\nof   Section   17(1)   and/or   17(4).       Therefore,   while   examining   the   land \r\n\r\n\r\nowner\'s   challenge   to   the   acquisition   of   land   in   a   petition   filed   under \r\n\r\n\r\nArticle   226   of   the   Constitution,     the   High   Court   should   not   adopt   a \r\n\r\n\r\npedantic approach, as has been done in the present case, and decide the \r\n\r\n\r\nmatter  keeping  in  view the  constitutional   goals  of  social  and  economic \r\n\r\n\r\njustice and the fact that even though the right to property is no longer a \r\n\r\n\r\nfundamental right, the same continues to be an important constitutional \r\n\r\n\r\nright   and   in   terms   of   Article   300-A,   no   person   can   be   deprived   of   his \r\n\r\n\r\nproperty   except   by   authority   of   law.     In   cases   where   the   acquisition   is \r\n\r\n\r\nmade   by   invoking   Section   4   read   with   Section   17(1)   and/or   17(4),   the \r\n\r\n\r\nHigh Court should insist upon filing of reply affidavit by the respondents \r\n\r\n\r\nand production of the relevant records and carefully scrutinize the same \r\n\r\n\r\nbefore   pronouncing   upon   legality   of   the   impugned   notification/action \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause a negative result without examining the relevant records to find \r\n\r\n\r\nout whether the competent authority had formed a bona fide opinion on \r\n\r\n\r\nthe issue of invoking the urgency provision and excluding the application \r\n\r\n\r\nof Section 5-A is likely to make the land owner a landless poor and force \r\n\r\n\r\nhim to migrate to the nearby city only to live in a slum.  A departure from \r\n\r\n\r\nthis   rule   should   be   made   only   when   land   is   required   to   meet   really \r\n\r\n\r\nemergent   situations   like   those   enumerated   in   Section   17(2).     If   the \r\n\r\n\r\nacquisition   is   intended   to   benefit   private   person(s)   and   the   provisions \r\n\r\n\r\ncontained in Section 17(1) and/or 17(4) are invoked, then scrutiny of the \r\n\r\n\r\njustification   put forward  by  the  State  should  be  more  rigorous  in cases \r\n\r\n\r\ninvolving the challenge to the acquisition of land, the pleadings should be \r\n\r\n\r\nliberally   construed   and   relief   should   not   be   denied   to   the   petitioner   by \r\n\r\n\r\napplying the technical rules of procedure embodied in the Code of Civil \r\n\r\n\r\nProcedure and other procedural laws. In this context it will be profitable \r\n\r\n\r\nto   notice   the   observations   made   by   this   Court   in  Authorised   Officer, \r\n\r\n\r\nThanjavur   v.   S   Naganatha   Ayyar  (1979)   3   SCC   466,   which   are     as \r\n\r\n\r\nunder:\r\n\r\n\r\n            \"It is true that Judges are constitutional invigilators \r\n\r\n            and   statutory   interpreters;   but   they   are   also   responsive \r\n\r\n            and responsible to Part IV of the Constitution being one \r\n\r\n            of  the   trinity   of  the  nation\'s   appointed   instrumentalities \r\n\r\n            in   the   transformation   of   the   socio-economic   order.   The \r\n\r\n            judiciary, in its sphere, shares the revolutionary purpose \r\n\r\n            of   the   constitutional   order,   and   when   called   upon   to \r\n\r\n            decode   social   legislation   must   be   animated   by   a   goal-\r\n\r\n            oriented   approach.   This   is   part   of   the   dynamics   of \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                statutory   interpretation   in   the   developing   countries   so \r\n\r\n                that courts are not converted into rescue shelters for those \r\n\r\n                who  seek  to  defeat  agrarian  justice  by  cute  transactions \r\n\r\n                of   many   manifestations   now   so   familiar   in   the   country \r\n\r\n                and   illustrated   by   the   several   cases   under   appeal.   This \r\n\r\n                caveat has become necessary because the judiciary is not \r\n\r\n                a mere umpire, as some assume, but an activist catalyst in \r\n\r\n                the constitutional scheme.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19.     We may now advert to the ancillary question whether the High Court \r\n\r\n\r\nwas justified in non suiting the appellants on the ground that they failed to \r\n\r\n\r\ndischarge   the   primary   burden   of   proving   that   the   State   Government   had \r\n\r\n\r\ninvoked Section 17(1) and 17(4) without application of mind to the relevant \r\n\r\n\r\nconsiderations.   In this context, it is apposite to observe that while dealing \r\n\r\n\r\nwith challenge to the acquisition  of land belonging to those who suffer from \r\n\r\n\r\nhandicaps of poverty, illiteracy and ignorance and do not have the resources \r\n\r\n\r\nto access the material relied upon by the functionaries of the   State and its \r\n\r\n\r\nagencies for forming an opinion or recording a satisfaction that the urgency \r\n\r\n\r\nprovisions   contained   in   Section   17(1)   should   be   resorted   to   and/or   the \r\n\r\n\r\nenquiry   envisaged   under   Section   5A   should     be   dispensed   with,   the   High \r\n\r\n\r\nCourt   should   not   literally   apply   the   abstract   rules   of   burden   of   proof \r\n\r\n\r\nenshrined   in   the   Evidence   Act.     It   is   too   much   to   expect   from   the   rustic \r\n\r\n\r\nvillagers, who are not conversant with the intricacies of law and functioning \r\n\r\n\r\nof the judicial system in our country to first obtain relevant information and \r\n\r\n\r\nrecords   from   the   concerned   State   authorities   and   then   present   skillfully \r\n\r\n\r\ndrafted petition for enforcement of his legal and/or constitutional rights. The \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCourt should also bear in mind that the relevant records are always  in the \r\n\r\n\r\nexclusive   possession/domain   of   the   authorities   of   the   State   and/or   its \r\n\r\n\r\nagencies.     Therefore,   an   assertion   by   the   appellants   that   there   was   no \r\n\r\n\r\nurgency   in   the   acquisition   of   land;   that   the   concerned   authorities   did   not \r\n\r\n\r\napply  mind  to  the  relevant  factors  and  records  and  arbitrarily  invoked  the \r\n\r\n\r\nurgency   provisions   and   thereby   denied   him   the   minimum   opportunity   of \r\n\r\n\r\nhearing in terms of Section 5-A(1) and (2), should be treated as sufficient \r\n\r\n\r\nfor   calling   upon   the   respondents   to   file   their   response   and   produce   the \r\n\r\n\r\nrelevant records to justify the invoking of urgency provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n20.     In  Narayan   Govind   Gavate   v.   State   of   Maharashtra  (supra),   the \r\n\r\n\r\nthree-Judge Bench of this Court examined the correctness of the judgment \r\n\r\n\r\nof   the   Bombay   High   Court   whereby   the   acquisition   of   land   by   the   State \r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment by issuing notification under Section 4 read with Section 17(1) \r\n\r\n\r\nand 17(4) for development and utilisation as residential and industrial area \r\n\r\n\r\nwas  quashed.   The   High Court held  that  the  purpose  of  acquisition  was a \r\n\r\n\r\ngenuine public purpose but quashed the notifications by observing that the \r\n\r\n\r\nburden   of   proving   the   existence   of   circumstances   which   could   justify \r\n\r\n\r\ninvoking   of   urgency   clause   was   on   the   State,   which   it   had   failed   to \r\n\r\n\r\ndischarge. Some of the observations made by the High Court, which have \r\n\r\n\r\nbeen extracted in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the judgment of this Court, are \r\n\r\n\r\nreproduced below.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When the formation of an opinion or the satisfaction of \r\n\r\nan authority is subjective but is a condition precedent to \r\n\r\nthe exercise of a power, the challenge to the formation of \r\n\r\nsuch opinion or to such satisfaction is limited, in law, to \r\n\r\nthree   points   only.   It   can   be   challenged,   firstly,   on   the \r\n\r\nground   of   mala   fides;   secondly,   on   the   ground   that   the \r\n\r\nauthority which formed that opinion or which arrived at \r\n\r\nsuch satisfaction did not apply its mind to the material on \r\n\r\nwhich it formed the opinion or arrived at the satisfaction, \r\n\r\nand,   thirdly,   that   the   material   on   which   it   formed   its \r\n\r\nopinion   or   reached   the   satisfaction   was   so   insufficient \r\n\r\nthat no man  could reasonably  reach that conclusion.  So \r\n\r\nfar as the third point is concerned, no court of law can, as \r\n\r\nin an appeal, consider that, on the material placed before \r\n\r\nthe   authority,   the   authority   was   justified   in   reaching   its \r\n\r\nconclusion.   The   court   can   interfere   only   in   such   cases \r\n\r\nwhere there was no material at all or the material was so \r\n\r\ninsufficient   that   no   man   could   have   reasonably   reached \r\n\r\nthat conclusion. \r\n\r\nIn   the   case   before   us   the   petitioner   has   stated   in   the \r\n\r\npetition more than once that the urgency clause had been \r\n\r\napplied without any valid reason. The urgency clause in \r\n\r\nrespect of each of the said two notifications  concerning \r\n\r\nthe lands in Groups 1 and 2 is contained in the relative \r\n\r\nSection 4 notification itself. The public purpose stated in \r\n\r\nthe notification is `for development and utilization of the \r\n\r\nsaid lands as an industrial and residential area\'. To start \r\n\r\nwith, this statement itself is vague, in the sense that it is \r\n\r\nnot clear whether the development and utilization of the \r\n\r\nlands   referred   to   in   that   statement   was   confined   to   the \r\n\r\nlands mentioned in the schedule to the notification or it \r\n\r\napplied to a wider area of which such lands formed only \r\n\r\na   part.   So   far   as   the   affidavit   in   reply   is   concerned,   no \r\n\r\nfacts   whatever   are   stated.   The   affidavit   only   states   that \r\n\r\nthe   authority   i.e.   the   Commissioner   of   the   Bombay \r\n\r\nDivision   was   satisfied   that   the   possession   of   the   said \r\n\r\nlands  was  urgently   required   for the  purpose   of  carrying \r\n\r\nout   the   said   development.   Even   Mr   Setalvad   conceded \r\n\r\nthat the affidavit does not contain a statement of facts on \r\n\r\nwhich the authority was satisfied or on which it formed \r\n\r\nits   opinion.  It   is,   therefore,   quite   clear   that   the \r\n\r\nrespondents  have failed  to bring on record any material \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                whatever   on   which   the   respondents   formed   the   opinion \r\n\r\n                mentioned   in   the   two   notifications.  The   notifications \r\n\r\n                themselves show that they concern many lands other than \r\n\r\n                those   falling   in   the   said   first   and   third   groups.   It   is   not \r\n\r\n                possible   to   know   what   was   the   development   for   which \r\n\r\n                the lands were being acquired, much less is it possible to \r\n\r\n                know   what   were   the   circumstances   which   caused \r\n\r\n                urgency   in   the   taking   of   possession   of   such   lands.  We \r\n\r\n                have held that the burden of proving such circumstances, \r\n\r\n                at   least   prima   facie   is   on   the   respondents.   As   the \r\n\r\n                respondents   have   brought   no   relevant   material   on   the \r\n\r\n                record,   the   respondents   have   failed   to   discharge   that \r\n\r\n                burden.  We   must,   in   conclusion,   hold   that   the   urgency \r\n\r\n                provision   under   Section   17(4)   was   not   validly   resorted \r\n\r\n                to.\"\r\n\r\n                                                                     (emphasis supplied)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        While   dealing   with   the   argument   of   the   State   that   it   was   for   the \r\n\r\n\r\npetitioner   to   prove   that   there   was   no   material   to   justify   invoking   of   the \r\n\r\n\r\nurgency clause, this Court observed:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"We do not think that a question relating to burden of proof is \r\n\r\n        always free from difficulty or is quite so simple as it is sought \r\n\r\n        to   be   made   out   here.   Indeed,   the   apparent   simplicity   of   a \r\n\r\n        question relating to presumptions and burdens of proof, which \r\n\r\n        have   to   be   always   viewed   together   is   often   deceptive.   Over \r\n\r\n        simplification  of  such  questions  leads  to  erroneous  statements \r\n\r\n        and misapplications of the law.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        The Court then referred to the judgment in Woolmington v. Director \r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Prosecutions,  1935 AC 462, extensively quoted from     Phipson on \r\n\r\n\r\nEvidence (11th Edn),  noticed Sections 101 to 106 of the Evidence Act and \r\n\r\n\r\nobserved:\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Coming   back   to   the   cases   before   us,   we   find   that   the \r\n\r\nHigh   Court   had   correctly   stated   the   grounds   on   which \r\n\r\neven a subjective opinion as to the existence of the need \r\n\r\nto   take   action   under   Section   17(4)   of   the   Act   can   be \r\n\r\nchallenged on certain limited grounds. But, as soon as we \r\n\r\nspeak of a challenge we have to bear in mind the general \r\n\r\nburdens   laid   down   by   Sections   101   and   102   of   the \r\n\r\nEvidence  Act.  It   is  for  the   petitioner  to  substantiate  the \r\n\r\ngrounds of his challenge. This means  that the petitioner \r\n\r\nhas  to either  lead evidence or show  that some  evidence \r\n\r\nhas come from the side of the respondents to indicate that \r\n\r\nhis challenge to a notification or order is made good. If \r\n\r\nhe does not succeed in discharging that duty his petition \r\n\r\nwill fail. But, is that the position in the cases before us? \r\n\r\nWe   find   that,   although   the   High   Court   had   stated   the \r\n\r\nquestion before it to be one which \"narrows down to the \r\n\r\npoint as to the burden of proof\" yet, it had analysed the \r\n\r\nevidence   sufficiently   before   it   to   reach   the   conclusion \r\n\r\nthat   the   urgency   provision   under   Section   17(4)   had   not \r\n\r\nbeen validly resorted to.\r\n\r\n                                              \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n We think that the original or stable onus laid down by \r\n\r\nSection 101 and Section 102 of the Evidence Act cannot \r\n\r\nbe shifted by the use of Section 106 of the Evidence Act, \r\n\r\nalthough   the   particular   onus   of   providing   facts   and \r\n\r\ncircumstances   lying   especially   within   the   knowledge   of \r\n\r\nthe official who formed the opinion which resulted in the \r\n\r\nnotification   under   Section   17   (4)   of   the   Act   rests   upon \r\n\r\nthat   official.   The   recital,   if   it   is   not   defective,   may \r\n\r\nobviate   the   need   to   look   further.   But,   there   may   be \r\n\r\ncircumstances in the case which impel the court to look \r\n\r\nbeyond it. And, at that stage, Section 106 Evidence Act \r\n\r\ncan   be   invoked   by   the   party   assailing   an   order   or \r\n\r\nnotification.   It   is   most   unsafe   in   such   cases   for   the \r\n\r\nofficial or authority concerned to rest content which non-\r\n\r\ndisclosure of facts especially within his or its knowledge \r\n\r\nby relying on the sufficiency of a recital. Such an attitude \r\n\r\nmay itself justify further judicial scrutiny.\r\n\r\n                                              \r\n\r\nIn   the   cases   before   us,   if   the   total   evidence   from \r\n\r\nwhichever side any of it may have come, was insufficient \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            to   enable   the   petitioners   to   discharge   their   general   or \r\n\r\n            stable   onus,   their   petitions   could   not   succeed.   On   the \r\n\r\n            other hand, if, in addition to the bare assertions made by \r\n\r\n            the petitioners, that the urgency contemplated by Section \r\n\r\n            17(4)   did   not   exist,   there   were   other   facts   and \r\n\r\n            circumstances,   including   the   failure   of   the   State   to \r\n\r\n            indicate   facts   and   circumstances   which   it   could   have \r\n\r\n            easily  disclosed  if  they  existed, the petitioners  could be \r\n\r\n            held to have discharged their general onus.\r\n\r\n                                                            \r\n\r\n            It is also clear that, even a technically correct recital in an \r\n\r\n            order or notification stating that the conditions precedent \r\n\r\n            to   the   exercise   of   a   power   have   been   fulfilled   may   not \r\n\r\n            debar   the   court   in   a   given   case   from   considering   the \r\n\r\n            question   whether,   in   fact,   those   conditions   have   been \r\n\r\n            fulfilled.     And,   a   fortiori,   the   court   may   consider   and \r\n\r\n            decide   whether   the   authority   concerned   has   applied   its \r\n\r\n            mind   to   really   relevant   facts   of   a   case   with   a   view   to \r\n\r\n            determining that a condition precedent to the exercise of \r\n\r\n            a   power   has   been   fulfilled.     If   it   appears,   upon   an \r\n\r\n            examination  of  the  totality   of facts   in  the  case,   that  the \r\n\r\n            power conferred has been exercised for an extraneous or \r\n\r\n            irrelevant purpose or that the mind has not been applied \r\n\r\n            at all to the real object or purpose of a power, so that the \r\n\r\n            result is that the exercise of power could only serve some \r\n\r\n            other or collateral object, the court will interfere.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court finally held as under:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            \"There is no indication whatsoever in the \r\n\r\n            affidavit   filed   on   behalf   of   the   State   the   mind   of   the \r\n\r\n            Commissioner was applied at all to the question whether \r\n\r\n            it was a case necessitating the elimination of the enquiry \r\n\r\n            under   Section5A   of   the   Act.   The   recitals   in   the \r\n\r\n            notifications, on the other hand, indicate that elimination \r\n\r\n            of the enquiry under Section 5A of the Act was treated as \r\n\r\n            an automatic consequence of the opinion formed on other \r\n\r\n            matters.  The  recital does not say  at all that any opinion \r\n\r\n            was   formed   on   the   need   to   dispense   with   the   enquiry \r\n\r\n            under   Section   5A   of   the   Act.   It   is   certainly   a   case   in \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               which   the   recital   was   at   least   defective.   The   burden, \r\n\r\n               therefore, rested upon the State to remove the defect, if \r\n\r\n               possible,   by   evidence   to   show   that   some   exceptional \r\n\r\n               circumstances   which   necessitated   the   elimination   of   an \r\n\r\n               enquiry under Section 5A of the Act and that the mind of \r\n\r\n               the Commissioner was applied to this essential question. \r\n\r\n               It seems to us that the High Court correctly   applied the \r\n\r\n               provisions   of  Section   106  of  the   Evidence   Act   to  place \r\n\r\n               the   burden   upon   the   State     to   prove   those   special \r\n\r\n               circumstances,   although   it   also   appears   to   us   that   the \r\n\r\n               High Court was quite correct in stating its view in such a \r\n\r\n               manner as to make it appear that some part of the initial \r\n\r\n               burden of the petitioners  under Sections 101 and 102 of \r\n\r\n               the Evidence Act had been displaced by the failure of the \r\n\r\n               State to discharge  its duty under Section 106 of the Act. \r\n\r\n               The correct way of putting it would have been to say that \r\n\r\n               the failure of the State  to produce the evidence of facts \r\n\r\n               especially   within   the   knowledge   of   its   officials,   which \r\n\r\n               rested   upon   it   under   Section   106   of   the   Evidence   Act, \r\n\r\n               taken together with the attendant facts and circumstances \r\n\r\n               including   the   contents   of   recitals,   had   enabled   the \r\n\r\n               petitioners to discharge  their burden under Sections 101 \r\n\r\n               and 102 of the Evidence Act.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                              (emphasis supplied)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21.     The ratio of the aforesaid judgment was recently followed by the two-\r\n\r\n\r\nJudge  Bench   in  Anand  Singh  v.

However,  the   only   amendment   which   is  relevant   for   deciding \r\n\r\n\r\nthis case is the insertion of proviso to Section 17(4) vide Uttar Pradesh Act \r\n\r\n\r\nNo.8 of 1974.  That proviso reads as under:\r\n\r\n\r\n                \"Provided that where in the case of any land, notification \r\n\r\n                under section 4, sub-section (1) has been published in the \r\n\r\n                Official   Gazette   on   or   after   September   24,   1984   but \r\n\r\n                before   January   11,   1989,   and   the   appropriate \r\n\r\n                Government has under this sub-section directed that the \r\n\r\n                provisions   of   section   5A   shall   not   apply,   a   declaration \r\n\r\n                under section 6 in respect of the land may be made either \r\n\r\n                simultaneously with, or at any time after, the publication \r\n\r\n                in the Official Gazette of the notification under section 4, \r\n\r\n                sub-section (1).\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23.     ANALYSIS OF THE PROVISIONS:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Section   4(1)   lays   down   that   whenever   it   appears   to   the   appropriate \r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment that land in any locality is needed or is likely to be needed for \r\n\r\n\r\nany   public   purpose   or   for   a   company,   then   a   notification   to   that   effect   is \r\n\r\n\r\nrequired to be published in the Official Gazette and two daily newspapers \r\n\r\n\r\nhaving   circulation   in   the   locality.     Of   these,   one   paper   has   to   be   in   the \r\n\r\n\r\nregional language.  A duty is also cast on the Collector, as defined in Section \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3(c), to cause public notice of the substance of such notification to be given \r\n\r\n\r\nat convenient places in the locality.  The last date of publication and giving \r\n\r\n\r\nof   public   notice   is   treated   as   the   date   of   publication   of   the   notification. \r\n\r\n\r\nSection   4(2)   lays   down   that   after   publication   of   the   notification   under \r\n\r\n\r\nSection   4(1),   any   officer   authorised   by   the  Government  in  this   behalf,   his \r\n\r\n\r\nservants or workmen can enter upon and survey and take levels of any land \r\n\r\n\r\nin   the   locality   or to   dig   or   bore   into   the   sub-soil   and   to   do   all   other   acts \r\n\r\n\r\nnecessary for ascertaining that land is suitable for the purpose of acquisition. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe   concerned  officer,  his   servants  or  workmen   can  fix   the  boundaries  of \r\n\r\n\r\nland   proposed   to   be   acquired   and   the   intended   line   of   the   work,   if   any, \r\n\r\n\r\nproposed to be made on it.  They can also mark such levels and boundaries \r\n\r\n\r\nby   marks   and   cutting   trenches   and   cut   down   and   clear   any   part   of   any \r\n\r\n\r\nstanding crops, fence or jungle for the purpose of completing the survey and \r\n\r\n\r\ntaking level, marking of boundaries and line.   However, neither the officer \r\n\r\n\r\nnor his servants or workmen can, without the consent of the occupier, enter \r\n\r\n\r\ninto   any   building   or   upon   any   enclosed   court   or   garden   attached   to   a \r\n\r\n\r\ndwelling house without giving seven days\' notice to the occupier.     Section \r\n\r\n\r\n5A,  which   embodies  the  most   important  dimension  of  the  rules  of  natural \r\n\r\n\r\njustice,   lays   down   that   any   person   interested   in   any   land   notified   under \r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4(1) may, within 30 days of publication of the notification, submit \r\n\r\n\r\nobjection in writing against the proposed acquisition of land or of any land \r\n\r\n\r\nin the locality to the Collector.  The Collector is required to give the objector \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan opportunity of being heard either in person or by any person authorized \r\n\r\n\r\nby him or by pleader.  After hearing the objector (s) and making such further \r\n\r\n\r\ninquiry,   as   he   may   think   necessary,   the   Collector   has   to   make   a   report   in \r\n\r\n\r\nrespect of land notified under Section 4(1) with his recommendations on the \r\n\r\n\r\nobjections and forward the same to the Government along with the record of \r\n\r\n\r\nthe proceedings held by him.   The Collector can make  different reports in \r\n\r\n\r\nrespect of different parcels of land proposed to be acquired.  Upon receipt of \r\n\r\n\r\nthe Collector\'s report, the appropriate Government is required to take action \r\n\r\n\r\nunder Section 6(1) which lays down that after considering the report, if any, \r\n\r\n\r\nmade   under   Section   5-A   (2),   the   appropriate   Government   is   satisfied   that \r\n\r\n\r\nany particular land is needed for a public purpose, then a declaration to that \r\n\r\n\r\neffect   is   required   to   be   made   under   the   signatures   of   a   Secretary   to   the \r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment   or   of   some   officer   duly   authorised   to   certify   its   orders.   This \r\n\r\n\r\nsection also envisages making of different declarations from time to time in \r\n\r\n\r\nrespect of different parcels of land covered by the same notification issued \r\n\r\n\r\nunder   Section   5(1).     In   terms   of  clause   (ii)   of   proviso   to   Section   6(1),   no \r\n\r\n\r\ndeclaration in respect of any particular land covered by a notification issued \r\n\r\n\r\nunder   Section   4(1),   which   is   published   after   24.9.1989   can   be   made   after \r\n\r\n\r\nexpiry of one year from the date of publication of the notification.  To put it \r\n\r\n\r\ndifferently,  a declaration  is required  to be made  under Section  6(1) within \r\n\r\n\r\none year from the date of publication of the notification under Section 4(1). \r\n\r\n\r\nIn   terms   of   Section   6(2),   every   declaration   made   under   Section   6(1)   is \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrequired to be published in the official gazette and in two daily newspapers \r\n\r\n\r\nhaving circulation in the locality in which land proposed to be acquired is \r\n\r\n\r\nsituated.     Of   these,   at   least   one   must   be   in   the   regional   language.     The \r\n\r\n\r\nCollector   is   also   required   to   cause   public   notice   of   the   substance   of   such \r\n\r\n\r\ndeclaration to be given at convenient places in the locality.  The declaration \r\n\r\n\r\nto   be   published   under   Section   6(2)   must   contain   the   district   or   other \r\n\r\n\r\nterritorial   division   in   which   land   is   situate,   the   purpose   for   which   it   is \r\n\r\n\r\nneeded,   its   approximate   area   or  a   plan  is   made   in  respect   of   land  and   the \r\n\r\n\r\nplace where such plan can be inspected.   Section 6 (3) lays down that the \r\n\r\n\r\ndeclaration made under Section 6(1) shall be conclusive evidence of the fact \r\n\r\n\r\nthat land is needed for a public purpose. After publication of the declaration \r\n\r\n\r\nunder   Section   6,   the   Collector   is   required   to   take   order   from   the   State \r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment for the acquisition of land to be carved out and measured and \r\n\r\n\r\nplanned (Sections 7 and 8). The next stage as envisaged is issue of public \r\n\r\n\r\nnotice   and   individual   notice   to   the   persons   interested   in   land   to   file   their \r\n\r\n\r\nclaim for compensation. Section 11 envisages holding of an enquiry into the \r\n\r\n\r\nclaim and passing of an award by the Collector who is required to take into \r\n\r\n\r\nconsideration the provisions contained in Section 23. Section 16 lays down \r\n\r\n\r\nthat after making an award the Collector can take possession of land which \r\n\r\n\r\nshall thereafter  vest in the Government. Section  17(1) postulates taking of \r\n\r\n\r\npossession of land without making an award.  If the appropriate Government \r\n\r\n\r\ndecides   that   land   proposed   to   be   acquired   is   urgently   needed   for   a   public \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npurpose   then   it   can   authorise   the   competent   authority   to   take   possession. \r\n\r\n\r\nSection 17(2) contemplates a different type of urgency in which, the State \r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment   can   authorise   taking   of   possession   even   before   expiry   of   15 \r\n\r\n\r\ndays period specified in Section 9 (1).  Section 17(4) lays down that in cases \r\n\r\n\r\nwhere   appropriate   Government   comes   to   the   conclusion   that   there   is \r\n\r\n\r\nexistence   of   an   urgency   or   unforeseen   emergency,   it   can   direct   that \r\n\r\n\r\nprovisions of Section 5-A shall not apply.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n24.      Before   adverting   to   the   precedents   in   which   Section   5A   has   been \r\n\r\n\r\ninterpreted by this Court, it will be useful to notice development of the law \r\n\r\n\r\nrelating   to   the   rule   of   hearing.   In   the   celebrated   case   of  Cooper   v. \r\n\r\n\r\nWandsworth Board of Works (1863) 143 ER 414, the principle was stated \r\n\r\n\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n\r\n         \"Even God did not pass a sentence upon Adam, before he was \r\n\r\n         called upon to make his defence.  \"Adam\" says God, \"where art \r\n\r\n         thou?     hast   thou   not   eaten   of   the   tree   whereof   I   commanded \r\n\r\n         thee that thou shouldest not eat\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTherein   the   District   Board   had   brought   down   the   house   of   the   plaintiff\'s \r\n\r\n\r\n(Cooper),   because   he   had   failed   to   comply   with   The   Metropolis   Local \r\n\r\n\r\nManagement Act.   The Act required the plaintiff to notify the board seven \r\n\r\n\r\ndays before starting to build the house.  Cooper argued that even though the \r\n\r\n\r\nboard had the legal authority to tear his house down, no person should be \r\n\r\n\r\ndeprived of their property without notice.  In spite of no express words in the \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstatute the court recognized the right of hearing before the plaintiff\'s house \r\n\r\n\r\nbuilt without permission was demolished in the exercise of statutory powers. \r\n\r\n\r\nByles J stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               `Although there are not positive words in a statute \r\n\r\n               requiring   that   the   party   shall   be   heard,   yet   the \r\n\r\n               justice   of   the   common   law   shall   supply   the \r\n\r\n               omission of the legislature\'.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n25.    Perhaps the best known statement on the right to be heard has come \r\n\r\n\r\nfrom Lord Loreburn, L.C. in Board of Education v. Rice (1911 AC 179 at \r\n\r\n\r\n182), where he observed: \r\n\r\n\r\n       \"Comparatively   recent   statutes   have   extended,   if   they   have \r\n\r\n       originated, the practice of imposing upon departments or offices \r\n\r\n       of   State   the   duty   of   deciding   or   determining   questions   of \r\n\r\n       various kindsIn such cases they must act in good faith and \r\n\r\n       fairly listen to both sides, for that is a duty lying upon everyone \r\n\r\n       who   decides   anything.     But   I   do   not   think   they   are   bound   to \r\n\r\n       treat such questions as though it were a trial they can obtain \r\n\r\n       information   in   any   way   they   think   best,   always   giving   a   fair \r\n\r\n       opportunity   to   those   who   are   parties   in   the   controversy   for \r\n\r\n       correcting or contradicting any relevant statement prejudicial in \r\n\r\n       their view.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n26.    In  Ridge   v.   Baldwin  1964   AC   40   Lord   Reid   emphasized   on   the \r\n\r\n\r\nuniversality of the right to a fair hearing whether it concerns the property or \r\n\r\n\r\ntenure   of   an   office   or   membership   of   an   institution.     In  O\'Reilly   v. \r\n\r\n\r\nMackman 1983 2 AC 237, Lord Diplock said that the right of a man to be \r\n\r\n\r\ngiven   a   fair   opportunity   of   hearing,   what   is   alleged   against   him   and   of \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npresenting his own case is so fundamental to any civilized legal system that \r\n\r\n\r\nit is to be presumed that Parliament intended that failure to observe the same \r\n\r\n\r\nshould   render   null   and   void   any   decision   reached   in   breach   of   this \r\n\r\n\r\nrequirement.  In Lloyd v. Mcmahon 1987 AC 625 Lord Bridge said:\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"My   Lords,   the   so-called   rules   of   natural   justice   are   not \r\n\r\n        engraved  on tablets  of  stone.   To  use  the  phrase   which better \r\n\r\n        expresses   the   underlying   concept,   what   the   requirements   of \r\n\r\n        fairness   demand   when   any   body,   domestic,   administrative   or \r\n\r\n        judicial, has to make a decision which will affect the rights of \r\n\r\n        individuals   depends   on   the   character   of   the   decision-making \r\n\r\n        body, the kind of decision it has to make and the statutory or \r\n\r\n        other framework in which it operates. In particular, it is well-\r\n\r\n        established  that when a statute has conferred on any body the \r\n\r\n        power  to make   decisions  affecting  individuals,  the  courts  will \r\n\r\n        not  only  require   the   procedure  prescribed  by  the  statute  to  be \r\n\r\n        followed,   but   will   readily   imply   so   much   and   no   more   to   be \r\n\r\n        introduced  by way of additional procedural  safeguards  as will \r\n\r\n        ensure the attainment of fairness.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n27.     In the United States, principles of natural justice usually find support \r\n\r\n\r\nfrom the Due Process clause of the Constitution.  The extent of due process \r\n\r\n\r\nprotection   required   is   determined   by   a   number   of   factors;   first   the   private \r\n\r\n\r\ninterest   that   will   be   affected   by   the   official   action;   second,   the   risk   of   an \r\n\r\n\r\nerroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the \r\n\r\n\r\nprobable   value,   if   any,   of   additional   or   substitute   procedural   requirement \r\n\r\n\r\nwould entail.  \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n28.    The   amplitude,   ambit   and   width  of   the   rule   of  audi  alteram   partem \r\n\r\n\r\nwas lucidly stated by the three-Judge bench in  Sayeedur Rehman v. State \r\n\r\n\r\nof Bihar (1973) 3 SCC 333 in the following words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               \"11This   unwritten   right   of   hearing   is \r\n\r\n               fundamental   to   a   just   decision   by   any   authority   which \r\n\r\n               decides   a   controversial   issue   affecting   the   rights   of   the \r\n\r\n               rival contestants. This right has its roots in the notion of \r\n\r\n               fair   procedure.   It   draws   the   attention   of   the   party \r\n\r\n               concerned to the imperative necessity of not overlooking \r\n\r\n               the other side of the case before coming to its decision, \r\n\r\n               for   nothing   is   more   likely   to   conduce   to   just   and   right \r\n\r\n               decision   than   the   practice   of   giving   hearing   to   the \r\n\r\n               affected parties.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n29.    In  Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner  (1978) 1 \r\n\r\n\r\nSCC   405,   Krishna   Iyer   J.   speaking   for   himself,   Beg   CJ   and   Bhagwati   J. \r\n\r\n\r\nhighlighted the importance of rule of hearing in the following words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               \"43. Indeed, natural justice is a pervasive facet of secular \r\n\r\n               law   where   a   spiritual   touch   enlivens   legislation, \r\n\r\n               administration and adjudication, to make fairness a creed \r\n\r\n               of life. It has, many colours and shades, many forms and \r\n\r\n               shapes   and,   save   where   valid   law   excludes   it,   applies \r\n\r\n               when   people   are   affected   by   acts   of   authority.   It   is   the \r\n\r\n               hone   of   healthy   government,   recognised   from   earliest \r\n\r\n               times   and   not   a   mystic   testament   of   Judge-made   law. \r\n\r\n               Indeed,   from   the   legendary   days   of   Adam   --   and   of \r\n\r\n               Kautilya\'s  Arthasastra  --   the   rule   of   law   has   had   this \r\n\r\n               stamp of natural justice which makes it social justice. We \r\n\r\n               need   not   go   into   these   deeps   for   the   present   except   to \r\n\r\n               indicate that the roots of natural justice and its foliage are \r\n\r\n               noble and not new-fangled. Today its application must be \r\n\r\n               sustained by current legislation, case-law or other extant \r\n\r\n               principle, not the hoary chords of legend and history. Our \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               jurisprudence has sanctioned its prevalence even like the \r\n\r\n               Anglo-American system.\r\n\r\n                                                                  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n               48.  Once we understand the soul of the rule as fair play \r\n\r\n               in action -- and it is so -- we must hold that it extends to \r\n\r\n               both   the   fields.   After   all,   administrative   power   in   a \r\n\r\n               democratic set-up is not allergic to fairness in action and \r\n\r\n               discretionary   executive   justice   cannot   degenerate   into \r\n\r\n          The High Court was justified in non-suiting the appellants on the ground that they had not raised a specific plea supported by a proper affidavit to question the decision taken by the State Government to invoke Section 17(1) and 17(4) of the Act. There was not any valid ground or justification for invoking the urgency provision contained in Section 17(1) and to exclude the application of Section 5A for the acquisition of land for planned industrial development of the district. The acquisition is primarily meant to cater private interest in the name of industrial development of the district. No evidence has been produced before the Court to show that the State Government and/or agencies/instrumentalities of the State are intending to establish industrial units on the acquired land either by itself or through its agencies/instrumentalities. The Supreme Court observed that even if planned industrial development of the district is treated as public purpose within the meaning of Section 4, there was no urgency which could justify the exercise of power by the State Government under Section 17(1) and 17(4). The private entrepreneurs, who are desirous of making investment in the State, take their own time in setting up the industrial units. Therefore, time required for ensuring compliance of the provisions contained in Section 5-A cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be portrayed as delay which will frustrate the purpose of acquisition and it was held that there was no real and substantive urgency to justify invoking of the urgency provision under Section 17(1) and to exclude the application of Section 5-A. The order of the High Court set aside. The respondents are directed to proceed from the stage of Section 4 notification and take appropriate action after complying with Section 5-A(1) and (2) of the Act. The appeal was allowed. Appeals Allowed','Daya Shankar Vs State Of M.P Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.\n\n\n\n1.    Leave granted.\n\n\n\n2.    Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a Division Bench of the\n\nMadhya Pradesh High Court upholding the conviction of the appellant for\n\noffence punishable under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the Indian\n\nPenal Code, 1860 (in short the `IPC&apos;) as was awarded by learned Additional\n\nSessions Judge, Panna, in Sessions Trial No.15/1992.\n3.    Prosecution version as unfolded during trial is as follows:\n\n\n\n      On 30th November, 1991 at about 5.00 p.m. Ram Kishore (hereinafter\n\nreferred to as the `deceased&apos;) was murdered in an agricultural field. First\n\nInformation Report was lodged by Manik Lal at Police Station, Pawal in the\n\nevening at about 7.00 p.m. Offence was registered as Crime No.124/91\n\nunder Section 302/34 IPC. Deceased had eloped with Lalli, sister of\n\nRamcharan (A-2) and both of them had performed court marriage. The court\n\nmarriage was registered and Lalli was living with Ramkishore. The\n\nappellant was having enmity with deceased on account of aforesaid\n\nincident. Deceased after eloping with Lalli was living in some other village\n\nand returned to his village a month before the incident. Ramkishore had\n\ngone to answer the call of nature in the evening on 30.11.1991 at about 4.30\n\np.m. towards the agricultural field of Gadka. Around 5 p.m. Phulla (A-3)\n\narmed with axe, Ramcharan (A-2) armed with sword alongwith\n\nDayashankar (A-1) and Munni Lal (A-4) went to the field of Gadaka. Munni\n\nLal and Dayashankar were barehanded. Phulla gave axe blow on the head of\n\ndeceased. Thereafter, Dayashankar and Munnilal, the co-accused pulled the\n\nlegs of deceased and threw him on the ground. Ram Kishore fell on the\n\n\n\n \ncrops in the field. Ramcharan assaulted the deceased by sword on the chest.\n\nThen he placed his sword on the chest of the deceased. On account of\n\nbeating he died. Police after receiving information of the commission of\n\ncrime carried out the investigation, arrested the accused persons and filed\n\nthe challan on 3.1.1992 before the Court of Judicial Magistrate. Case was\n\ncommitted to the Court of Sessions Judge. Trial Court framed charges under\n\nSection 302/34 IPC against the accused persons. After recording the\n\nevidence the trial Court convicted the accused persons for offence under\n\nSections 302 read with Section 34 IPC and sentenced them as afore-noted.\n\n\n\n      Before the High Court the basic stand was that the prosecution failed\n\nto prove common intention on the part of the appellants and, therefore,\n\nSection 34 had no application. The individual act of the appellant should\n\nhave been considered. Merely because the appellant had accompanied other\n\naccused persons, that cannot be sufficient to warrant presumption of\n\ncommon intention.\n\n\n\n4.    Learned counsel for the State submitted that the eye witnesses PWs 2\n\nand 3 had described the act of each of the appellants and the role ascribed to\n\nthe appellant was that he pulled the leg of the deceased as a result of which\n\n\n\n \ndeceased fell in the field of Masur crop and thereafter he was assaulted by\n\nother accused persons. The appeal was dismissed accepting the stand of the\n\nState.\n\n\n\n5.       Learned counsel for the appellant re-iterated the stand taken before\n\nthe High Court and submitted that Section 34 IPC has no application.\n\n\n\n6.       Learned counsel for the State on the other hand supported the\n\njudgment.\n\n\n\n7.       Section 34 has been enacted on the principle of joint liability in the\n\ndoing of a criminal act. The Section is only a rule of evidence and does not\n\ncreate a substantive offence. The distinctive feature of the Section is the\n\neleme Indian Penal Code, 1860 - Section 302/34 - Murder- - Conviction and sentence- - Whether calls for obstruction?- - Held, \"yes\"- - Evidence of observers did not credit any clear demonstration to litigant - Mere truth that he was in organization of blamed who were equipped - Not adequate to draw in Section 34- - Appellant not outfitted - He had no ill will with expired - Stand that he pulled leg of perished - Not built up - Not suitable to hold appealing party blameworthy by utilization of Section 34- - His conviction put aside.

The Board of Trustees of the Port of Bombay is the appellant\n\nbefore us.\n\n2.

After some arguments were advanced by\n\nthe learned counsel for the parties, our attention was drawn to an order of\n\nthis Court dated 3rd of August, 2001 from which it appears that the\n\nappellant had invoked the bank guarantee on 29th of March, 1988.\n\nHowever, the bank chose not to make the payment and in fact on 28th of\n\nApril, 1988, the High Court granted stay of encashment of the bank\nguarantee. This Court in that order also noted that the bank guarantee in\n\nquestion had expired on 24th of February, 1989. This Court while passing\n\nthe aforesaid order made the following direction :\n\n            \"pending hearing of the appeal, it shall pay to\n      the appellant the amount of the bank guarantee which was\n      invoked on 29th of March, 1988 along with interest at the rate\n      of 18% with quarterly rests with effect from the date of the\n      invocati Civil  Injunction - Suit petitioned for order controlling the appealing party from encashing a bank ensure issued by the bank at the case of the respondent No. 1 - Appellant had conjured the bank ensure yet the bank picked not to make the installment - High Court conceded remain of encashment of the bank ensure - Appellant has as of now been paid by the bank - Held, litigant was qualified for get the central aggregate together with enthusiasm at the rate of 8% - Appeal discarded. [para 3] ','G. Narayana Raju Vs G. Chamaraju &amp; Others CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 613 of 1965.\nAppeal from the judgment and decree dated March 25, 1960  of\nthe Mysore High Court in Regular Appeal No. 155 of 1953.\nV. Krishnamurthy and R. Gopdlakrishnan, for the appellant.\nH.   R.	 Gokhale,  B.  Subbiah	and  R.	 Thiagaraian,	for,\nrespondents Nos. 2 and 4.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRamaswami,  J. The plaintiff G. Narayana Raju filed O.S.  34\nof  1951-52  in	 the Court of  District	 Judge,	 Mysore	 for\npartition   and	 separate  possession  of  suit	  properties\nmentioned in the various schedules of the plaint.  The first\ndefendant is the brother\n \nof  the	 plaintiff.  The second defendant is  the  widow  of\nMuniswami  Raju, the eldest brother of the  plaintiff.	 The\nthird	defendant  is  the  legal  representative   of	 the\nplaintiffs  mother.  She is now the, appellant	having	been\nbrought	 on  record  as	 the  legal  representative  of	 the\ndeceased  plaintiff. The case of the original plaintiff	 was\nthat he, the first defendant and Muniswami Raju (husband  of\nthe  second defendant) were the sons of one Gopala Raju	 and\nwere all members of the joint family Gopalaraju died in	 May\n1931  and  after his death the plaintiff  and  his  brothers\ncontinued  to  be members of the joint	family.	  The  joint\nstatus	of  the,  family  was severed  by  the	issue  of  a\nregistered notice by the first defendant to the plaintiff in\nJuly 1951.  An ancestral house in Nazar bad belonging to the\nfamily was acquired by the City IuprovementTrust Board in or\nabout the year 1909.  Out of the compensation paid for	that\nhouse and supplemented by the earnings of the members of the\njoint  family, the house item No. I of Schedule &apos;A&apos;  to	 the\nplaint	was  purchased by Gopalaraju in or  about  the	year\n1910.	Subsequently  item No. 2 of Schedule  &apos;A&apos;  was	also\npurchased by Gopalaraju from the income of item No. I supple\nmented	by the earnings of the members of the  family.	 All\nthe other items of properties mentioned in Schedule &apos;A&apos;	 and\nother Schedules attached to the plaint were acquired out  of\nthe  income  from  items 1 and 2 of  Schedule  &apos;A&apos;,  It	 was\nfurther	 alleged that the business known as \"Ambika  Stores\"\nwas  also the joint family business and all  the  properties\nmentioned in the Schedules except items I and 2 of  Schedule\n&apos;A&apos;  were acquired out of the income of the members  of	 the\nfamily	including  the income from the	business  of  Ambika\nStores.	  The plaintiff accordingly claimed that he and	 the\nfirst defendant would each be entitled to get 5/14ths  share\nand  the second and third defendants would each be  entitled\nto  get	 2/14ths. share.  In the alternative  the  plaintiff\npleaded	 that  if  for any reason the Court  held  that	 the\nproperties stand in the name of Muniswami Raju and were	 not\nacquired with the aidof the joint familv nucleus, he and the\nsecond defendant were entitled to equal shares as  co-owners\nof the joint family business.  The suit was mainly contested\nby  the	 second defendant who asserted that  the  properties\nmentioned  in  all the Schedules of the	 plaint	 were  self-\nacquisitions of Miiniswami Raju and constituted his separate\nproperties.  It was alleged that Muniswami Raju was the only\ncarniiig member of the family at the time of the acquisition\nof items 1 and 2 of Schedule operties and the plaintiff	 and\nthe  first defendant were emploved,in petty jobs  in  Wesley\nPress.	 Muniswami Raju later on employed the  plaintiff  in\nhis  -shop  as	a salaried servant and	the  latter  had  no\nproprietary  right in the business of Ambika Stores.   After\nconsideration  of  the	oral and  documentary  evidence	 the\nDistrict Judge held that the plaintiff, first defendant	 and\nMuniswami  Raju were not divided and that the only  property\nwhich was divisible was item No. I of Schedule\n \n&apos;A&apos;  and  there	 was not sufficient  ancestral	nucleus	 for\nacquisition of the other properties and that all  properties\nexcept item No. 1 of Schedule &apos;A were the self	acquisitions\nof  Muniswami Raju, that Muniswami I Raju never blended	 his\nproperties with that of the joint family that the  plaintiff\nwas  only an employee under Muniswami Raju and therefore  he\nwas not entitled to the alternativ &apos; relief claimed by	him.\nAccordingly, the District Judge granted a preliminary decree\nholding	 that the plaintiff was entitled to 2/7ths share  in\nitem  No. I of Schedule &apos;A&apos;.  The plaintiff took the  matter\nin  appeal to the Mysore High Court.  By its judgment  dated\nMarch  25,  1960 the High Court affirmed the decree  of	 the\ntrial court with the modification that besides item No. I of\nSchedule  &apos;A&apos;  item No. 2 also should be hold  to  be  joint\nfamily property and the plaintiff was entitled to  partition\nof  his share in this item also.  The High  Court  cancelled\nthe  I	direction of the District Judge that  the  plaintiff\nshould	account for the moneys and properties  of  Muniswami\nRaju  -in  his hands before he is given	 possession  of	 his\nshare.\nThis  appeal  is  brought by certificate on  behalf  of	 the\nplaintiff  from the judgment of the Mysore High Court  dated\nMarch 25, 1960 in R.A. No. 155 of 1953.\nThe  first  question  to be considered	in  this  appeal  is\nwhether	 the  business	of  Ambika  Stores  was	 really	 the\nbusiness  of the joint family and whether the plaintiff	 was\nentitled. to a partition of his share in the assets of	that\nbusiness.: It was contended on behalf of the appellant	that\nthe  business of Ambika Stores grew out of a nucleus of	 the\njoint family funds of at least by the efforts of the members\nof  the joint family include the appellant.  The  contention\nof the appellant has been negatived by both the lower courts\nand there is a concurrent finding that the Ambika Stores was\nthe  separate business of Muniswami Raju and it was  neither\nthe  joint  family  business nor  treated  as  joint  family\nbusiness, It is wellestablished that there is no presumption\nunder Hindu law that a business standing in the name of	 any\nmember	of the joint family is a joint family business	even\nif that member is the manager, of the joint family.  Unless,\nit  could  be shown that the business in the  hands  of	 the\ncoparcener  grew up with the assistance of the joint  family\nproperty  or joint family funds or that the earnings of	 the\nbusiness  were	blended with the joint	family	estate,	 the\nbusiness remains free and separate.  The question  therefore\nwhether	 the  business	was begun or  carried  on  with	 the\nassistance of joint family property or joint family funds or\nas  a  -family	business is a  question	 of  fact.-(See	 the\ndecisions of the Judicial Committee in Bhwu Mal v. Jagannath\n(1)  and in Pearey Lal v. Nanak Chand (1) and of this  Court\nin Chattahatha Karayalar v. Ramachandra\n(1)   A.T.R 1943 P.C 40.\n(2)   A.T.R. 1948 P.C  108.\n \nlyer)  (1).   In  the present, case there  is  a  concurrent\nfinding of both the lower courts that the business of Ambika\nStores	was a separate, business of Muniswami Raju  and	 it,\nwas  neither  a joint family business nor treated  as  joint\nfamily business.  The concurrent finding of the lower courts\non  this issue is upon a finding of fact and  following	 the\nusual practice of this Court, it is not now open to  further\nscrutiny by this Court under Art. 133 of the Constitution.\nIt  was, however, contended on behalf of the appellant	that\nthe finding of the lower. courts is vitiated in, law because\nof  the circumstance that they have not taken  into  account\nthree important documents, Ex.	D, Ex.	E and Ex.  DDD.	  We\nare  unable  to	 accept this argument  as  correct.   It  is\nmanifest on a perusal of the judgment of the High Court that\nall  the documents have been examined, regarding  the  issue\nwhether	 the  business of Ambika Stores was a  joint  family\nbusiness  or whether it was p. separate, business  of  Muni-\nswami  Raju.  As regards Ex.  D, the High-,Court has,  after\nexamining the evidence adduced, remarked that the, mere fact\nthat  item No. 2 of Schedule &apos;A was given as a	security  by\nMuniswami Raju did not result in any detriment to the  joint\nfamily	property and, it cannot therefore be held  that	 the\nbusiness of Ambika Stores grew out of the joint family funds\nor with the aid of the joint family funds.  On behalf of the\nappellant  reliance was placed on the recitals in Ex.  E,  a\ndeed of mortgage dated July 26, 1928 executed by Gopalaraju,\nMuniswamiraju  and  the appellant in favour  of	 the  Mysore\nBank.	The  property  that had been  mortgaged	 under	this\ndocument is item No. 2 of Schedule &apos;A&apos;.	 The recital is that\nthe  borrowing from the Bank was for the business and  trade\nof  the	 executants and -for the benefit and  use  of  their\nfamily.	  There is also a recital in an earlier	 portion  of\nthe document that the business, was being carried on for the\nbenefit	 of  the  family, but it is not quite  clear  as  to\nwhether this related to the business carried on by  Narayana\nRaju  or whether it was intended to relate to some  business\ncarried on by all the three executants.	 It is possible that\nthe  appellant had other business of his own carried on	 -on\nhis own. account at that time and it cannot be, assumed that\nthe borrowing under Ex.	 E must have been for the purpose of\nAmbika	Stores.	 It should be noticed that  Muniswarni	Raju\nhas  been  described in the document as	 the  proprietor  of\nAmbika Stores which description is. not consistent with	 the\ncontention  of the appellant that the business, was a  joint\nfamily	business.  The High Court has, in  this	 connection,\nreferred  to Ex.  I an application dated February 14,  1929,\nby  the	 appellant  to the City	 Co-operative  Bank,  Mysore\nwherein, the appellant has said that he was getting a decent\nearning	 by  doing;  out-of-door  commercial  business	with\nAmbika	Stores.	 There is also the, recital in Ex.   I	that\nMuniswami Raju was the proprietor of Ambika Stores.   Having\nregard to this recital in I it is not-\n(1)  A.I.R. 1955 S.C. 799.\n \nunlikely that the appellant had some business of his own  at\nthe  material time and it cannot be assumed  that  borrowing\nunder Ex.  E, was for the purpose of Ambika Stores  business\nonly.  The High Court has also dealt with the effect of	 Ex.\nDDD, mortgage deed produced on behalf of the appellant.	  It\nis  true that in this document the appellant  and  Muniswami\nRaju  have been described as proprietors of  Ambika  Stores.\nThe finding of the High Court is that this recital was	made\nin the document for the purposes of borrowing from the Bank.\nReference was made in this context to a letter dated May  5,\n1931,  Ex.  75 written by Muniswami Raju  as  proprietor  of\nAmbika	Stores to the Bank of Mysore.  In&apos; this	 letter,  he\nhas requested the Bank to take note of the fact that he	 has\nauthorised the appellant to accept drafts, and sign  letters\netc. on behalf of the firm&apos; There is another Letter, Ex. 76,\ndated  April 14, 1934 written by Muniswami Raju to the	Bank\nof  Mysore wherein Muniswami Raju has been described as	 the\nproprietor  of Ambika Stores and there is an  intimation  to\nthe Bank, that the appellant Narayana Raju was authorised to\nsign  for the firm.  In the context and background of  these\ncircumstances  it is evident that though both the  appellant\nand  Muniswami Raju were described as proprietors of  Ambika\nStores the description was only for the purpose of borrowing\nmoney  from the Bank, as contended for by  the	respondents.\nIn  this  connection  the High Court  has  also	 taken	into\naccount Ex. 7 5 (b), a letter written by Muniswami Raju.  In\nthis  letter  Muniswami Raju has described  himself  as	 the\nproprietor of Ambika Stores and has instructed the Bank that\nhe   The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Ramaswami, J. The plaintiff G. Narayana Raju filed O.S. 34 of 1951-52 in the Court of District Judge, Mysore for partition and separate possession of suit properties mentioned in the various schedules of the plaint. The first defendant is the brother of the plaintiff. The second defendant is the widow of Muniswami Raju, the eldest brother of the plaintiff. The third defendant is the legal representative of the plaintiffs mother. She is now the, appellant having been brought on record as the legal representative of the deceased plaintiff. The case of the original plaintiff was that he, the first defendant and Muniswami Raju (husband of the second defendant) were the sons of one Gopala Raju and were all members of the joint family Gopalaraju died in May 1931 and after his death the plaintiff and his brothers continued to be members of the joint family. The joint status of the, family was severed by the issue of a registered notice by the first defendant to the plaintiff in July 1951. An ancestral house in Nazar bad belonging to the family was acquired by the City IuprovementTrust Board in or about the year 1909. Out of the compensation paid for that house and supplemented by the earnings of the members of the joint family, the house item No. I of Schedule \'A\' to the plaint was purchased by Gopalaraju in or about the year 1910. Subsequently item No. 2 of Schedule \'A\' was also purchased by Gopalaraju from the income of item No. I supple mented by the earnings of the members of the family. All the other items of properties mentioned in Schedule \'A\' and other Schedules attached to the plaint were acquired out of the income from items 1 and 2 of Schedule \'A\', It was further alleged that the business known as \"Ambika Stores\" was also the joint family business and all the properties mentioned in the Schedules except items I and 2 of Schedule \'A\' were acquired out of the income of the members of the family including the income from the business of Ambika Stores. The plaintiff accordingly claimed that he and the first defendant would each be entitled to get 5/14ths share and the second and third defendants would each be entitled to get 2/14ths. share. In the alternative the plaintiff pleaded that if for any reason the Court held that the properties stand in the name of Muniswami Raju and were not acquired with the aidof the joint familv nucleus, he and the second defendant were entitled to equal shares as co-owners of the joint family business. The suit was mainly contested by the second defendant who asserted that the properties mentioned in all the Schedules of the plaint were self- acquisitions of Miiniswami Raju and constituted his separate properties. It was alleged that Muniswami Raju was the only carniiig member of the family at the time of the acquisition of items 1 and 2 of Schedule operties and the plaintiff and the first defendant were emploved,in petty jobs in Wesley Press. Muniswami Raju later on employed the plaintiff in his -shop as a salaried servant and the latter had no proprietary right in the business of Ambika Stores. After consideration of the oral and documentary evidence the District Judge held that the plaintiff, first defendant and Muniswami Raju were not divided and that the only property which was divisible was item No. I of Schedule \'A\' and there was not sufficient ancestral nucleus for acquisition of the other properties and that all properties except item No. 1 of Schedule \'A were the self acquisitions of Muniswami Raju, that Muniswami I Raju never blended his properties with that of the joint family that the plaintiff was only an employee under Muniswami Raju and therefore he was not entitled to the alternativ \' relief claimed by him. Accordingly, the District Judge granted a preliminary decree holding that the plaintiff was entitled to 2/7ths share in item No. I of Schedule \'A\'. The plaintiff took the matter in appeal to the Mysore High Court. By its judgment dated March 25, 1960 the High Court affirmed the decree of the trial court with the modification that besides item No. I of Schedule \'A\' item No. 2 also should be hold to be joint family property and the plaintiff was entitled to partition of his share in this item also. The High Court cancelled the I direction of the District Judge that the plaintiff should account for the moneys and properties of Muniswami Raju -in his hands before he is given possession of his share.\r\n\r\n\r\nheld:  the appellant during Muniswami Raju\'s life-time of his being a co-owner of the partnership business, nor is there any evidence of recognition by Muniswami Raju of any such right of the appellant. On the other hand, there is sufficient evidence to show that whatever the appellant did in connection with the business was only done with the Authority conferd by Muniswami Raju. In our opinion the High Court has rightly rejected the claim of the appellant that he was a co-owner of the partnership business.\r\n\r\ncourt  the reason expressed we hold that this appeal has no merit and it must be dismissed with costs.\r\n\r\n Appeal was dismissed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ','Rathnavathi & Anr Vs Kavita Ganashamdas Abhay Manohar Sapre, J.\r\n\r\n1.    Leave granted.\r\n\r\n2.    The plaintiff  filed  two  suits,  one  for  specific  performance  of\r\nagreement and other for grant of permanent injunction  in  relation  to  the\r\nsuit  house.  The  trial  court  vide  common  judgment  and  decree   dated\r\n16.10.2001 dismissed both the suits. The first appellate  court,  i.e.,  the\r\nHigh Court, in appeal, by impugned  judgment  and  decree  dated  08.09.2011\r\nreversed the judgment and decree of the trial court  and  decreed  both  the\r\nsuits in appeal, against the defendants.  Being aggrieved  by  the  judgment\r\nand decree of the High Court, Defendants 1 and 3 have approached this  Court\r\nin the instant civil appeals.\r\n3.    The question arises for consideration in these appeals is whether  the\r\nHigh Court was justified in allowing the  first  appeals  preferred  by  the\r\nplaintiff, resulting in decreeing the two civil suits against defendants  in\r\nrelation to suit house?\r\n4.    In order to appreciate the controversy involved in  the  civil  suits,\r\nand now in these appeals, it is necessary to state the relevant facts.\r\n5.    For the sake of convenience, description of parties  herein  is  taken\r\nfrom Original Suit No.223/2000.\r\n6.    Defendant no.2 is the original owner of the suit house  and  defendant\r\nno.1 is the subsequent purchaser of the suit house from defendant no.2.\r\n7.    The dispute relates to a dwelling house bearing no. 351  Block  no.11,\r\nMatadahalli Extension,  now  known  as  R.T.  Nagar  Bangalore  (hereinafter\r\nreferred to as \" the suit house    ).\r\n8.    The suit house  was  purchased  by  defendant  no.  2  from  Bangalore\r\nDevelopment  Authority  (in  short     BDA   )  in  a  scheme.   On  15.02.1989,\r\nDefendant no. 2 entered into an agreement (Annexure-P-1) with plaintiff  for\r\nsale of suit house at a total consideration of Rs. 3,50,000/-. In  terms  of\r\nclause 2 of the agreement, the plaintiff paid  a  sum  of  Rs.  50,000/-  as\r\nadvance towards sale consideration. These facts are not in dispute.\r\n9.    On  07.01.2000,  the  plaintiff  filed  a  civil  suit  being  OS  No.\r\n223/2000, initially against 3 defendants for  seeking  permanent  injunction\r\nrestraining  the  defendants  jointly  and  severally  from  interfering  in\r\nplaintiff\'s possession over the  suit  house.  In  substance,  case  of  the\r\nplaintiff was  that  she  entered  into  an  agreement  on  15.02.1989  with\r\ndefendant no. 2 to purchase the suit house for Rs.  3,50,000/-  and  paid  a\r\nsum of Rs. 50,000/- to defendant no. 2 by way of advance  towards  the  sale\r\nconsideration. Later, the plaintiff further paid the  balance  consideration\r\nof Rs. 3 Lacs towards the sale price  and  obtained  receipts  acknowledging\r\nthe payment so made. It was  alleged  that  the  plaintiff  was  accordingly\r\nplaced in actual physical possession of the suit house and  since  then  she\r\nhas been in possession of the suit house. It was alleged that she also  made\r\nsome improvements therein by spending money and is  paying  electricity  and\r\nwater charges etc. It was further alleged that the  plaintiff  was  and  has\r\nalways been ready and willing to perform her part of the  agreement  to  get\r\nthe sale deed executed in her favour after having performed her part of  the\r\ncontract. However, defendant no. 2, for the reasons best known to  her,  did\r\nnot  execute  the  sale  deed  despite  having  received   the   full   sale\r\nconsideration from the plaintiff. It was alleged that defendant no.  1,  who\r\nis a total stranger to the  suit  house  and  having  no  right,  title  and\r\ninterest in the suit house, on 2.1.2000 visited the suit  house  along  with\r\ndefendant no.  2  and  some  other  unwanted  elements  and  threatened  the\r\nplaintiff to dispossess her from the suit house. It was  also  alleged  that\r\non 8.1.2000, defendant nos. 1 and 2 again visited and attempted  to  assault\r\nthe plaintiff and unsuccessfully attempted to commit trespass  in  the  suit\r\nhouse.\r\n10.   On seeing the hostile attitude of defendant nos. 1  and  2  and  their\r\nassociates, the plaintiff immediately lodged a complaint  in  the  concerned\r\npolice station. Since police authorities did not take any action, which  was\r\nrequired of, the plaintiff filed the  aforesaid  civil  suit  for  permanent\r\ninjunction restraining the  defendants  from  interfering  in  her  peaceful\r\npossession over the suit house. It was submitted that the  plaintiff  has  a\r\nprima facie case, so also the balance of convenience  and  irreparable  loss\r\nin her favour, which entitles her to claim permanent injunction against  the\r\ndefendants in relation to the suit house. The plaintiff  also  averred  that\r\nshe reserved her right to file a suit for specific performance of  agreement\r\nagainst the defendants.\r\n11.   The aforesaid suit was contested by defendant nos.  1  and  2.   While\r\nadmitting the ownership of defendant no. 2 over the suit house and the  fact\r\nof entering into an agreement  with  the  plaintiff  for  its  sale  to  the\r\nplaintiff and further while admitting the receipt of advance payment  of  Rs\r\n50,000/- from the plaintiff, the defendants denied all material  allegations\r\nmade in the plaint. It was alleged  that  the  plaintiff  did  not  pay  the\r\nbalance consideration as alleged. It was also alleged that defendant  no.  2\r\non 25.10.1995 cancelled the agreement dt 15.02.1989 by sending legal  notice\r\nto the plaintiff and then  sold  the  suit  house  to  defendant  no.  1  on\r\n09.02.1998 for Rs. 4 lacs and placed her in its possession.\r\n12.   On 31.03.2000, the plaintiff filed another civil  suit  being  OS  No.\r\n2334 of 2000 in  the  Court  of  City  Civil  Judge  Bangalore  against  the\r\ndefendants  for  specific  performance  of  agreement  dated  15.02.1989  in\r\nrelation to the suit house.\r\n13.   After pleading the same facts, which are set out above, the  plaintiff\r\nfurther alleged that she has performed her part of the agreement  by  paying\r\nentire sale consideration of Rs. 3,50,000/- and has been  in  possession  of\r\nthe suit house. It was alleged that  on  the  one  hand,  defendant  no.  2,\r\ndespite having received full sale consideration, did not  perform  her  part\r\nof the agreement by not getting the suit house  transferred  in  plaintiff\'s\r\nfavour as per clause 3 of the agreement and by doing the acts which she  was\r\nexpected to do in terms of agreement,  and  on  the  other  hand,  tried  to\r\ninterfere in plaintiff\'s lawful possession over the suit house.\r\n14.   This led the plaintiff to serve upon defendant  no.2  a  legal  notice\r\ndated 6.3.2000 thereby calling upon defendant no.2 to execute the sale  deed\r\nin relation to suit property in plaintiff\'s favour.  Since  despite  service\r\nof legal notice, defendant no. 2  failed  to  execute  the  same,  suit  for\r\nspecific performance was also filed. The plaintiff then by way of  amendment\r\nalso sought to add one prayer for cancellation of sale deed alleged to  have\r\nbeen executed by defendant  no.  2  in  favour  of  defendant  no.  1.  This\r\namendment was allowed.\r\n15.    The  defendants  contested  the  civil  suit.  While  admitting   the\r\nexecution of agreement dated 15.02.1989 with the plaintiff for sale of  suit\r\nhouse for Rs. 3,50,000/- and also admitting payment of Rs. 50,000/-  by  the\r\nplaintiff to defendant no. 2,  the  defendants  denied  all  other  material\r\nallegations and inter alia alleged that since the plaintiff  failed  to  pay\r\nthe balance sale consideration of Rs. 3 lacs to defendant no. 2 in terms  of\r\nthe agreement, defendant no. 2 on 25.10.1995 sent  a  legal  notice  to  the\r\nplaintiff cancelling the agreement dated 15.2.1989 and sold the  suit  house\r\nto defendant no. 1  on  09.02.1998  for  consideration  and  placed  her  in\r\npossession of the suit house. The defendants  also  alleged  that  defendant\r\nno. 1 was the bona fide purchaser for value and hence her  title  cannot  be\r\nquestioned in the suit.\r\n16.   The defendants also contested the suit on two legal grounds.  Firstly,\r\nit was contended that the suit was not maintainable, as  the  bar  contained\r\nin Order II Rule 2 of Code of Civil Procedure,  1908  (hereinafter  referred\r\nto as \'CPC\') did not permit the plaintiff to  file  the  suit  for  specific\r\nperformance of agreement in question against the defendants. It was  alleged\r\nthat relief to claim specific performance of agreement was available to  the\r\nplaintiff when she filed the first suit  (OS  No.  223/2000)  for  permanent\r\ninjunction against the defendants. Yet, the plaintiff failed  to  claim  the\r\nrelief in the first suit, consequently,  the  second  suit  filed  to  claim\r\nspecific performance of agreement in question is hit by rigor  contained  in\r\nOrder II Rule 2 of CPC. It is now barred and hence liable  to  be  dismissed\r\nas not maintainable. Secondly, it was contended that the suit  is  otherwise\r\nbarred by limitation having been filed beyond  the  period  of  three  years\r\nfrom the date of accrual of cause of action as provided  in  Article  54  of\r\nthe Limitation Act, 1963. It was, therefore,  contended  that  the  suit  is\r\nliable to be dismissed as being barred by limitation, as well.\r\n17.   The trial court consolidated both the suits  for  trial.  Issues  were\r\nframed. Parties adduced  evidence.  The  trial  court  vide  judgment/decree\r\ndated 25.8.2009 though  answered  some  issues  in  plaintiff\'s  favour  but\r\neventually dismissed the civil suits. It was held that the  agreement  dated\r\n15.02.1989 was executed between the plaintiff and defendant no. 2  for  sale\r\nof suit house; that the plaintiff was  not  placed  in  possession  of  suit\r\nhouse pursuant to agreement in question; that the plaintiff  was  not  ready\r\nand willing to perform her part of the agreement; that  suit  is  barred  by\r\nlimitation; that the plaintiff was not entitled  to  claim  the  relief  for\r\nspecific performance of agreement; that the plaintiff was  not  entitled  to\r\nclaim the relief for grant of permanent injunction; that defendant no. 1  is\r\na bona fide purchaser of the suit house for value;  that the  plaintiff  was\r\nnot entitled to challenge the sale deed dt. 9.2.1998, that the suit was  hit\r\nby the bar contained in Order II Rule 2 of CPC  because  the  plaintiff  did\r\nnot obtain leave to file second suit for specific performance  while  filing\r\nthe first suit for grant of permanent injunction against the  defendants  in\r\nrelation to the suit house.\r\n18.   Feeling aggrieved, the  plaintiff  filed  two  regular  first  appeals\r\nbeing R.F.A. Nos. 1092 of 2009 and 1094 of 2009 before the  High  Court.  By\r\ncommon impugned judgment/decree, the High Court allowed  both  the  appeals,\r\nreversed the judgment/decree of the trial court and decreed both  the  civil\r\nsuits by passing a decree for specific performance of agreement against  the\r\ndefendants in relation to suit house and also  issued  permanent  injunction\r\nas claimed by the plaintiff. The High Court answered all the  aforementioned\r\nissues in plaintiff\'s favour and against the defendants.\r\n19.   The High Court  in  its  judgment  held  that  the  plaintiff  was  in\r\npossession of suit house; that the  plaintiff  performed  her  part  of  the\r\nagreement; that the plaintiff paid the  entire  sale  consideration  of  Rs.\r\n3,50,000/- to defendant no. 2; that the plaintiff was ready and  willing  to\r\nperform her part of agreement; that defendant no. 2 failed  to  perform  her\r\npart of the agreement thereby rendering her liable to perform  her  part  of\r\nagreement; and that subsequent sale even if  made  by  defendant  no.  2  in\r\nfavour of defendant no. 1 was not binding on the plaintiff  because  it  was\r\nnot bona fide.\r\n20.   The High Court, however, after deciding the issues in  favour  of  the\r\nplaintiff, directed that in order to weigh the equities between the  parties\r\nand keeping in view the price escalation, which is  unavoidable  in  present\r\ndays, the plaintiff will pay an additional sum of Rs. 4 lacs over and  above\r\nRs. 3,50,000/- to defendant no. 2 for obtaining sale deed in her favour.\r\n\r\n 21.  It is against this judgment/decree of the High Court,  the  defendants\r\nhave filed the present appeals by way of special leave petitions.\r\n22.   Mrs. Nalini Chidambaram, learned  Senior  Counsel  appearing  for  the\r\nappellants (defendants) while assailing the legality and correctness of  the\r\nimpugned judgment urged various submissions. Firstly, she  argued  that  the\r\nHigh Court erred in allowing plaintiff\'s  first  appeals,  as  according  to\r\nher, both the appeals were liable to be dismissed by upholding the  judgment\r\n/decree of the trial court which had rightly dismissed the suits.  Secondly,\r\nshe argued that second suit filed for claiming specific performance  of  the\r\nagreement for sale of suit house to the plaintiff was hit by  bar  contained\r\nin Order II Rule 2 of CPC for  the  reason  that  the  plaintiff  failed  to\r\nsecure leave in her first suit and  hence  the  second  suit  filed  by  the\r\nplaintiff for grant of specific performance was not  maintainable.  Thirdly,\r\nshe argued that assuming the second suit was held  maintainable,  even  then\r\nit was barred by limitation prescribed in Article 54 of the Limitation  Act.\r\nIt was  pointed  out  that  cause  of  action  to  file  suit  for  specific\r\nperformance of contract against  the  defendants  arose  in  the  year  1989\r\nitself no sooner 60 days period  expired  from  the  date  of  agreement  as\r\nprovided in clause 2  of  the  agreement,  whereas,  the  suit  in  question\r\nseeking specific performance was filed  in  year  2000  and  hence,  it  was\r\nhopelessly  barred  applying  the  limitation  prescribed  in  Article   54.\r\nFourthly, it was argued that in any case, there was  no  case  made  out  on\r\nevidence by the plaintiff for reversal of the findings relating to grant  of\r\nspecific performance of agreement because the plaintiff  was  neither  ready\r\nnor willing to perform her part of the  agreement  and  nor  there  was  any\r\nevidence to hold in her favour on this material issue. Fifthly,  she  argued\r\nthat there was no evidence to hold that the plaintiff was in  possession  of\r\nthe suit house; rather there was enough evidence to hold that after sale  of\r\nsuit house by defendant no.2 to defendant no.1, it was defendant  no.1,  who\r\nwas in possession. Therefore, it should have been held  that  the  plaintiff\r\nwas not in possession of the suit house, as was rightly held  by  the  trial\r\ncourt. And, lastly she argued that it should have been held with the aid  of\r\nevidence that defendant no. 1 was bona fide purchaser of the suit house  for\r\nvalue, as she purchased it after the owner i.e. defendant  no.  2  cancelled\r\nthe agreement dt 15.2.1989 and then sold the suit house to defendant no.  1.\r\n\r\n23.   After arguing  at  length  with  reference  to  documents  on  record,\r\nlearned counsel for the appellants contended that impugned judgment  /decree\r\ndeserves to be set aside  and  that  of  the  trial  court  be  restored  by\r\ndismissing both the suits filed  by  the  plaintiff.  Learned  counsel  also\r\nrelied upon certain decisions, which we shall refer later.\r\n24.   Mr. P. Vishwanatha Shetty, learned senior counsel for  the  respondent\r\n(plaintiff) supported the impugned judgment /decree and  contended  that  it\r\ndoes not call for any interference. According  to  learned  senior  counsel,\r\nall the findings recorded by the High Court, though of reversal, deserve  to\r\nbe upheld because the High Court, in exercise of its first appellate  powers\r\nunder Section 96 of CPC, rightly appreciated the evidence and  came  to  its\r\nindependent conclusion which it could legally do and which  it  rightly  did\r\nwhile allowing the two first appeals.  Learned  senior  counsel  urged  that\r\nthis Court  while  hearing  these  appeals  cannot  and  rather  should  not\r\nundertake the exercise of appreciating the whole evidence  again  like  that\r\nof the first appeal except to find out whether there is any  apparent  legal\r\nerror in the impugned judgment so as to call for any  interference  by  this\r\nCourt. Learned senior counsel submitted that no such  error  exists  in  the\r\nimpugned judgment and hence these appeals are liable to be dismissed.\r\n25.   Having heard the learned counsel for the parties at  length  and  upon\r\nperusal of the record of the case, we find no merit in these appeals  as  in\r\nour considered opinion, the submissions urged by the learned senior  counsel\r\nfor the appellants, though argued ably, have no force.\r\n26.   Coming first to the legal question as  to  whether  bar  contained  in\r\nOrder II Rule 2 of CPC is attracted so as to non- suit  the  plaintiff  from\r\nfiling  the  suit  for  specific  performance  of  the  agreement,  in   our\r\nconsidered opinion, the bar is not attracted\r\n27.   At the outset, we consider it apposite to take note of law  laid  down\r\nby the Constitution bench of this Court in Gurbux Singh  v.  Bhooralal,  AIR\r\n1964 SC 1810, wherein this Court while explaining the true  scope  of  Order\r\nII Rule  2  of  CPC  laid  down  the  parameters  as  to  how  and  in  what\r\ncircumstances, a plea should be  invoked  against  the  plaintiff.   Justice\r\nAyyangar speaking for the Bench held as under:\r\n   In order that a plea of a  bar  under  Order  2  Rule  2(3)  of  the  Civil\r\nProcedure Code should succeed the defendant who raises the  plea  must  make\r\nout (1) that the second suit was in respect of the same cause of  action  as\r\nthat on which the previous suit was based;  (2)  that  in  respect  of  that\r\ncause of action the plaintiff was entitled to more than one relief;  (3)that\r\nbeing thus entitled to more than one relief  the  plaintiff,  without  leave\r\nobtained from the Court omitted to sue for the relief for which  the  second\r\nsuit had been filed. From this analysis it would be seen that the  defendant\r\nwould have to establish primarily and to start with, the  precise  cause  of\r\naction upon which the previous suit was filed, for unless there is  identity\r\nbetween the cause of action on which the earlier suit was filed and that  on\r\nwhich the claim in the later suit is based there would be no scope  for  the\r\napplication of the bar      \r\n                                   (Emphasis supplied)\r\n\r\n28.   This Court has consistently followed the aforesaid enunciation of  law\r\nin later years and reference to only one of such recent decisions  in  Virgo\r\nIndustries (Eng.) P. Ltd. Vs Venturetech Solutions P.  Ltd.,  (2013)  1  SCC\r\n625, would suffice, wherein this Court reiterated the principle  of  law  in\r\nfollowing words:\r\n   The cardinal requirement for application of  the  provisions  contained  in\r\nOrder II Rules 2(2) and (3), therefore, is that the cause of action  in  the\r\nlater suit must be the same  as  in  the  first  suit.  It  will  be  wholly\r\nunnecessary to enter into any discourse on the  true  meaning  of  the  said\r\nexpression, i.e. cause  of  action,  particularly,  in  view  of  the  clear\r\nenunciation in a recent judgment of this  Court  in  the  Church  of  Christ\r\nCharitable Trust and Educational  Charitable  Society,  represented  by  its\r\nChairman   v.   Ponniamman   Educational   Trust    represented    by    its\r\nChairperson/Managing Trustee  JT  2012  (6)  SC  149.  The  huge  number  of\r\nopinions  rendered  on  the  issue  including  the  judicial  pronouncements\r\navailable does not fundamentally detract from what is stated  in  Halsbury\'s\r\nLaws of England, (4th Edition). The following reference from the above  work\r\nwould, therefore, be apt for being extracted herein below:\r\n\r\n       Cause of Action    has been defined as meaning simply a  factual  situation\r\nexistence of which entitles one person to obtain from  the  Court  a  remedy\r\nagainst another person. The phrase has been held from the earliest  time  to\r\ninclude every fact which is material to be proved to entitle  the  Plaintiff\r\nto succeed, and  every  fact  which  a  Defendant  would  have  a  right  to\r\ntraverse. \'Cause of action    has also been  taken  to  mean  that  particular\r\naction on the part of the Defendant which gives the Plaintiff his  cause  of\r\ncomplaint, or the subject-matter  of  grievance  founding  the  action,  not\r\nmerely the technical cause of action.   \r\n\r\n29.   In the instant case when we apply  the  aforementioned  principle,  we\r\nfind that bar contained in Order II Rule 2 is not attracted because  of  the\r\ndistinction in the cause of action for filing the two suits. So far  as  the\r\nsuit for permanent injunction is concerned, it was based on a  threat  given\r\nto the plaintiff by the defendants to dispossess her from the suit house  on\r\n2.1.2000 and 9.1.2000. This would be clear  from  reading  Para  17  of  the\r\nplaint. So far as cause of action to file suit for specific  performance  of\r\nagreement is concerned, the same was based on non performance  of  agreement\r\ndated 15.2.1989 by defendant no. 2  in  plaintiff\'s  favour  despite  giving\r\nlegal notice dated 6.3.2000 to defendant no. 2 to perform her part.\r\n30.   In our considered opinion, both the suits were, therefore, founded  on\r\ndifferent causes of action and hence could be filed  simultaneously.  Indeed\r\neven  the  ingredients  to  file  the  suit  for  permanent  injunction  are\r\ndifferent than that of the suit for specific performance of agreement\r\n31.   In case of former, plaintiff is required to make out the existence  of\r\nprima facie case, balance of convenience and irreparable loss likely  to  be\r\nsuffered by the plaintiff on facts with reference to the  suit  property  as\r\nprovided in Section 38 of the Specific  Relief  Act,  1963  (in  short     the\r\nAct   ) read with Order 39 Rule 1 &amp; 2 of CPC. Whereas, in case of  the  later,\r\nplaintiff is required to  plead  and  prove  her  continuous  readiness  and\r\nwillingness to perform her part of  agreement  and  to  further  prove  that\r\ndefendant failed to perform her  part  of  the  agreement  as  contained  in\r\nSection 16 of The Act.\r\n32.   One of the basic requirements for successfully invoking  the  plea  of\r\nOrder II Rule 2 of CPC is that the defendant of  the  second  suit  must  be\r\nable to show that the second suit was also in respect of the same  cause  of\r\naction as that on which the previous suit was based.\r\n33.   As mentioned supra, since in the case on hand, this basic  requirement\r\nin relation to cause of action is not made out, the  defendants  (appellants\r\nherein) are not entitled to raise a plea of bar contained in Order  II  Rule\r\n2 of CPC to successfully non suit the plaintiff from  prosecuting  her  suit\r\nfor specific performance of the agreement against the defendants.\r\n 34.  Indeed when the cause of action to claim the respective  reliefs  were\r\ndifferent so also the ingredients for  claiming  the  reliefs,  we  fail  to\r\nappreciate as to how a plea of Order II  Rule  2  could  be  allowed  to  be\r\nraised by the defendants and how it was sustainable on such facts.\r\n 35.  We cannot accept the submission of  learned  senior  counsel  for  the\r\nappellants when she contended that  since  both  the  suits  were  based  on\r\nidentical pleadings and when cause of action to sue for relief  of  specific\r\nperformance of agreement was available to the plaintiff prior to  filing  of\r\nthe first suit, the second suit was hit by bar contained in Order II Rule  2\r\nof CPC.\r\n36.   The submission has a fallacy for two basic reasons. Firstly,  as  held\r\nabove, cause of action in two suits being different,  a  suit  for  specific\r\nperformance could not have been instituted on the basis of cause  of  action\r\nof the first The question arises for consideration in these appeals is whether the High Court was justified in allowing the first appeals preferred by the plaintiff, resulting in decreeing the two civil suits against defendants in relation to suit house?- In order to appreciate the controversy involved in the civil suits, and now in these appeals, it was necessary to state the relevant facts- The dispute relates to a dwelling house -The suit house was purchased by defendant no. 2 from Bangalore Development Authority (in short BDA) in a scheme- Defendant no. 2 entered into an agreement with plaintiff for sale of suit house at a total consideration of Rs. 3,50,000/-- In terms of clause 2 of the agreement, the plaintiff paid a sum of Rs. 50,000/- as advance towards sale consideration-These facts are not in dispute- the plaintiff filed a civil suit being For injuction-Though this litigation was not between inter se owner and subsequent purchaser of the suit house yet in order to do substantial justice between the parties and to see the end of this long litigation and to prevent a fresh suit being instituted by defendant no.1 against defendant no.2 for refund of sale consideration which will again take years to decide and lastly when neither it involve any intricate adjudication of facts, nor it is going to cause any prejudice to the parties, we consider it just and proper to invoke our power under Article 142 of the Constitution of India in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case as narrated above and accordingly direct defendant no. 2 (owner of the suit house) to refund Rs. 4 lacs to defendant no. 1 within three months after execution of sale deed by them in favour of plaintiff pursuant to the impugned judgment/decree- failure to refund the amount within three months, would carry interest at the rate of 9% payable on the unpaid amount from the date of this order till recovery and defendant no. 1, in the event of non-payment by defendant no. 2, would be entitled to levy execution against defendant no. 2 for realization of outstanding money along with interest as awarded treating this order to be a decree in appropriate executing court in accordance with law- Held- These appeals were accordingly disposed of-  No costs. Disposed off','Ranjana Vs State Of Maharashtra &amp; Ors      This appeal arises out of the judgment and order, dated 28th\n\nNovember, 2002, in Writ Petition No. 5058 of 2002, delivered by a\n\nDivision Bench of the High Court of Judicature of Bombay at\n\nAurangabad. By the impugned order, the High Court has dismissed\n\nappellant&apos;s petition questioning the correctness of the orders passed\n\nby the Caste Scrutiny Committee, which had invalidated the claim of\n\nthe appellant as belonging to the \"Mahar\" caste, finally resulting in\n\nher disqualification as a Member of the Zilla Parishad, Aurangabad.\n\n     In order to appreciate the issue, requiring determination, a few\n\nmaterial facts may be stated:\n\n     The appellant was born on 29th May, 1976 to Namdeo Nathaiji\n\nBagul and Zalabai Bagul, a farmer \"Mahar\" family. On 22nd April,\n1996, she married Babasaheb Nana Sature, a resident of Village\n\nJategaon according to \"Boudh\" rites.\n\n     In January, 2002, elections to the Zilla Parishad, Aurangabad\n\nwere announced and in the said election, the Constituency of\n\n&apos;10-Mahalgaon Circle&apos; was reserved for a Scheduled Caste citizen.\n\nOn 31st January, 2002, the appellant approached the Sub-Divisional\n\nOfficer, Vaijapur and obtained a Caste Certificate declaring that she\n\nbelonged to \"Mahar\" caste, a listed Scheduled Caste in the\n\nConstitution (Schedule Castes) Order, 1950 for the State of\n\nMaharashtra. On the basis of her Caste Certificate, the appellant\n\nfiled the nomination form as a candidate of the Shiv Sena Party to\n\ncontest for the 10-Mahalgaon Circle Seat. On 18th February, 2002,\n\nthe appellant was declared elected.\n\n     On 5th March, 2002, a complaint was lodged before the District\n\nCollector, Aurangabad by Smt. Kavita Anna Bagul, one of the\n\ndefeated candidates, alleging that the appellant was disqualified to\n\ncontest the elections as a Scheduled Caste candidate because she\n\nwas born in a Christian family and professed Christianity. On 14th\n\nMarch, 2002, another complaint on the same lines was filed by\n\nRamesh Khandagale, General Secretary, Republican Party of India.\n\n     The Collector     referred   appellant&apos;s   caste   certificate   for\n\nvalidation to the Caste Scrutiny Committee (\"the Committee\", for\n\n\n\n \nshort), which in turn got a vigilance inquiry conducted. After the\n\nsubmission of the vigilance report, the appellant filed her defence\n\nstatement. To substantiate their respective claims before the\n\nCommittee,    the   appellant   and   the   complainants    adduced\n\ndocumentary and oral evidence. The Committee by a majority view\n\nof 2 : 1, vide its order dated 25th October, 2002/18th November, 2002\n\nreturned the finding that though the appellant was born in a \"Mahar\"\n\ncaste, but her family professed Christianity inasmuch as the\n\nappellant was baptized on 27th October, 1977, when she was one\n\nyear old; she was married in a Christian family and her contention\n\nthat she had embraced Buddhism on 23rd August, 1988 was not\n\nestablished. Thus, her claim that she belonged to \"Mahar\" caste (a\n\nScheduled Caste) was rejected.\n\n     Aggrieved by the order of the Committee, the appellant\n\npreferred a writ petition in the High Court, challenging the\n\ncorrectness of the findings of the Committee. It was pleaded on\n\nbehalf of the appellant that she was born in a \"Hindu Mahar\" family;\n\nher school record shows that she was a Hindu; later on she\n\nembraced Buddhism on 23rd August, 1988; there was no Baptism\n\nceremony on 27th October, 1977 and that her marriage as also of\n\nher brothers and sisters were solemnised as per Boudh traditions.\n\n\n\n\n \n     Tracing the origin of \"Mahars\", one of the socially backward\n\nclasses in Rural Maharashtra, the High Court noted the factum of\n\nlarge scale conversions of socially backward classes in the rural\n\nareas of Maharashtra to Christianity. The High Court also noticed\n\nthe amendment carried out in the Constitution (Scheduled Castes)\n\nOrder, 1950, by the Act No.15 of 1999, whereby and whereunder\n\nthe persons who had converted themselves to \"Buddhism\" were\n\nheld eligible for the benefit of reservation as available to the\n\nScheduled Castes from 1999 onwards. Taking into consideration the\n\nevidence on record, including the entries in the Baptism Register,\n\nthe High Court observed thus:\n\n     \"Reading the Baptism register and the entries thereof in\n     respect of the petitioner on 27.10.1977, with the\n     provisions of Canon Law as reproduced hereinabove, we\n     have no doubt in our mind that the petitioner&apos;s parents\n     professed Christianity when the petitioner was baptised at\n     the age of one year and she was born to Christian\n     parents. It is obvious that the petitioner&apos;s parents continue\n     with their caste identity namely \"Mahar caste\" but that by\n     itself would not be sufficient to hold that the petitioner did\n     not Profess Christianity and she was all along a \"Mahar\n     Hindu / Buddhist\".\n\n     In so far as the stand of the appellant that she had embraced\n\nBuddhism on her marriage is concerned, the High Court observed\n\nas under:\n\n           \"It appears that the petitioner was aware of the legal\n     position, namely: on reconversion to Buddhism or\n     Hinduism she can enter into the fold of Scheduled Castes\n     and she took the plea regarding her reconversion to\n\n \n     Buddhism. In support of this defence, she relied on the\n     certificate purportedly issued by Bhadant. This Dhamma\n     Dhiksha Certificate is purportedly dated 23.8.2002 by the\n     said Bhadant. The Committee had issued a notice calling\n     upon the said person to appear before it. In spite of receipt\n     of the notice, the said Bhadant did not appear before the\n     Committee on 30.8.2002. T  Civil  - Validity of Order - Dismissal of Appellant\'s request of scrutinizing the accuracy of the requests go by the Caste Scrutiny Committee, which had negated the claim of the Appellant as having a place with the \"Mahar\" position - Hence Appeal \r\n\r\nHeld, Finding of the Committee that the Appellant is not a Scheduled Caste, being basically a finding of actuality, it is not a fit case for exercise of ward under Article 136 of the Constitution - Though the High Court has found the section with respect to Appellant\'s Baptism to have been made in the typical course of Baptism, however the passage does not fundamentally demonstrate the way that her folks had likewise changed over to Christianity - Matter remanded [para 12, 14] ','Noor Salman Makani Vs Union Of India (Jayachandra The Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nK.  JAYACHANDRA REDDY, J.- Leave granted in SLP	 (Crl.)	 No.\n1484 of 1993.\n2.   In	 both  these  matters, Noor  Salman  Makani  who  is\ndetained  under Section 3 of the COFEPOSA Act,	1974  (&apos;Act&apos;\nfor  short) is the petitioner.	The petitioner is a  citizen\nof  India.   On	 August	 26, 1992  he  was  travelling	from\nCalcutta  to Hong Kong by Thai International Airways  Flight\nNo. TC314.  After completing the immigration formalities, he\napproached  the Customs counter for clearance.	The  Customs\nauthorities   opened  his  briefcase  and   recovered	huge\nquantities  of	foreign exchange of various  countries,	 the\nvalue of which is estimated at Rs 38,06,930.  On August	 27,\n1992  he was produced under arrest before the  CJM,  Barasat\nand his application for bail was rejected.  On September 19,\n1992 an order of detention dated September\n \n18,  1992  was	served on him in the  jail  along  with	 the\ngrounds	 of  detention.	 On October 1,	1992  a	 declaration\nunder  Section 9(1) of the Act was issued and the  same	 was\nserved	on the detenu on October 13, 1992.  On	October	 15,\n1992  the  petitioner made a representation to	the  Central\nGovernment   against  the  declaration	but  the  same	 was\nrejected.   On	December  28, 1992  the	 petitioner  made  a\nrepresentation	before the Advisory Board but that was	also\nrejected.  Thereafter he filed a writ of habeas corpus and a\nDivision  Bench	 of the Calcutta High  Court  dismissed	 the\nsame.	As against the said order the present SLP  in  which\nleave is granted, has been filed.  A separate Writ  Petition\n(Crl.)	No.  261 of 1993 questioning the  declaration  under\nSection	 9(1)  of the Act has also been filed  stating	that\ncertain	 new facts have come to light which  invalidate	 the\ndeclaration.   The  detention  order is	 questioned  on	 the\nground	 that	there	was   delay   in   considering	 the\nrepresentation	and  also on the ground that  the  detaining\nauthority has not duly considered the circumstance that	 the\ndetenu	was  already  in jail and has  simply  made  a	bald\nstatement in the grounds stating that \"there is	 possibility\nof  the	 detenu being released on bail\" and the	 same  shows\nthat there is non-application of mind.\n3.   From the records it appears that the representation  of\nthe  detenu addressed to the Joint Secretary, COFEPOSA,	 New\nDelhi was forwarded by Dum Dum Central Jail authority  under\nregistered  post on October 15, 1992 and it was received  by\nthe  Ministry&apos;s	 Office	 on  October 22,  1992	and  it	 was\nforwarded  to  the Sponsoring Unit on October 23,  1992	 who\nreceived  it on October 26, 1992.  After  offering  parawise\ncomments  the same was sent by speed post to the  Ministry&apos;s\nOffice	on  October  29,  1992 which  was  received  by	 the\nMinistry&apos;s  Office on November 2, 1992.	 The  representation\nwas  put up before the Joint Secretary on November  3,	1992\nand the same was rejected on November 4, 1992.	The  Finance\nSecretary recommended the rejection of the representation on\nNovember  5,  1992  and finally	 the  Minister	for  Finance\nrejected the same on the same day and a memo dated  November\n6,  1992 was issued to the petitioner intimating  him  about\nthe rejection.\n4.   Learned  counsel appearing for the	 petitioner  submits\nthat the delay between October 15, 1992 and November 2, 1992\nhas  not  been satisfactorily explained and hence  is  fatal\nbeing violative of Article 22(5) of the Constitution.  It is\nalso  his submission that the delay of every day has  to  be\nexplained  as held by the courts.  He relied on some of	 the\njudgments of this Court including Rama Dhondu Borade v. V.K.\nSaraf,	Commissioner of Police&apos;.  There is no doubt that  in\nmany  cases  this Court has reiterated that  the  right	 and\nobligation to make and to consider the representation at the\nearliest  opportunity is a constitutional  imperative  which\ncannot	be curtailed or abridged but in considering  whether\nthere  was  undue and unexplained delay, the facts  in	each\ncase have to be examined.  In Rama Dhondu Borade case&apos;	this\nCourt observed thus: (SCC p. 180, para 20)\n	      \"True,  there is no prescribed  period  either\n	      under  the provisions of the  Constitution  or\n	      under the concerned detention law within which\n	      the\n	      1	 (1989) 3 SCC 173: 1989 SCC (Cri)  520:	 AIR\n	      1989 SC 1861\n \n	      representation should be dealt with.  The	 use\n	      of the words &apos;as soon as may be&apos; occurring  in\n	      Article  22(5)  of the  Constitution  reflects\n	      that    the    representation    should	  be\n	      expeditiously considered and disposed of	with\n	      due promptitude and diligence and with a sense\n	      of urgency and without avoidable delay.	What\n	      is  reasonable dispatch depends on  the  facts\n	      and circumstances of each case and no hard and\n	      fast  rule  can be laid down in  that  regard.\n	      However,	in case the gap between the  receipt\n	      of the representation and its consideration by\n	      the authority is so unreasonably long and	 the\n	      explanation  offered  by the authority  is  so\n	      unsatisfactory,  such delay could vitiate	 the\n	      order of detention.\"\nIn  the above case the gap between receipt and	disposal  of\nthe representation was 28 days but up to the date of service\nof the order of rejection, the delay amounted to 32 days and\nthe court was not satisfied with the explanation offered and\nit was only after a delay of 14 days that the representation\nwas disposed of and the only explanation was that some	more\ninformation  was  called  for and that	there  were  certain\nholidays  in  between.	The Court held that  the  delay	 was\nunreasonable   and  the	 explanation   was   unsatisfactory.\nRelying	 on these observations, the learned counsel  submits\nthat in the instant case the period between October 15, 1992\nand  October  22,  1992 and between  October  23,  1992	 and\nNovember  2, 1992 amounted to undue and	 unexplained  delay.\nBut  if	 we  examine  the facts it  can	 be  seen  that	 the\nrepresentation	was forwarded by the Jail Superintendent  on\nOctober	 15,  1992 itself by registered post  but  that	 was\nreceived  on October 22, 1992 by the Ministry&apos;s	 Office	 and\nthe  entire delay was due to the delay in  postal  delivery.\nTherefore  the	same cannot be said to be  unreasonable	 and\nunexplained.   With regards the period between	October	 23,\n1992  and  November  2,	 1992  there  were  intervening	 two\nSaturdays  and	two  Sundays.  However, on  receipt  of	 the\nrepresentation on October 22, 1992 the same was forwarded on\nOctober	 23, 1992 for parawise comments.  In  this  context,\nthe High Court also has noted that to offer parawise remarks\nit  would  have taken some time because	 the  representation\ncontained   several   allegations   against   the    Customs\nauthorities and necessary information had to be gathered for\noffering  the remarks.	The Sponsoring Unit received  it  on\nOctober 26, 1992 and with the parawise remarks forwarded the\nsame by speed post to the Ministry on October 29, 1992.	  In\nbetween	 there	were two  AIR 1994 SC 575. \r\n\r\nProtection of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act (52 of 1974), S.3 - Representation by detenu - Received late by Ministry\'s office because of postal deferral - Parawise remarks made by supporting power - Representation containing a few assertions against traditions power - Necessary data accumulated for offering comments - Delay of five days by supporting power in sending it to Ministry\'s office in the wake of barring occasions - Not undue. \r\n\r\nConstitution of India, Art.22(5). \r\n\r\nPreservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act (52 of 1974), S.3 - Detention - Detenu as of now in prison - Bald explanation made all together that probability of detenu\'s discharge on safeguard couldn\'t be discounted - Detenu really discharged on safeguard consequently - Detention not rendered unlawful. \r\n\r\nPreservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act (52 of 1974), S.9 - Declaration - Detenu as of now in prison - Subsequent arrival of detenu on safeguard subject to specific conditions - Order of safeguard not imperative archive - Declaration not obligated to be put aside on ground that such request was not set before power before making affirmation. \r\n\r\nProtection of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act (52 of 1974), S.9 - Declaration - Subsequent withdrawal of admission by detenu - Retraction observed to be bit of hindsight - Non-putting of such withdrawal before pronouncing power - Subjective fulfillment of power not vitiated. ','Sunil Vs State Of Maharashtra Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.\n\n\n\n1.      Leave granted.\n\n2.      Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a Division Bench of the\n\nBombay High Court, Aurangabad Bench dismissing the appeals filed by\n\nseveral accused persons. The present appeal is by original accused No. 6\n\n\n\n\n \n(hereinafter referred to as the A6). He was convicted for various offences\n\npunishable under the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short the `IPC&apos;) and\n\nsentenced to undergo custodial imprisonment and fine with default\n\nstipulation. The High Court dismissed the appeal so far as the present\n\nappellant is concerned, we are not concerned with the other appeals.\n\n\n\n3.    Prosecution version in a nutshell is as follows:\n\n\n\n      A.S.I. Yadav Satpute(P.W. 11) who was attached to police station,\n\nPathardi and was on duty as a Police Station officer on 7.3.1998, received a\n\nphone call at about 2230 hrs. informing him that there was stone pelting at\n\nRangar Galli and, therefore, he sent the necessary police force. He made an\n\nentry at sr. no. 30 in the station diary and at about 10.45 p.m. sent a message\n\nto the Control Room and the other police stations. An entry in this behalf\n\nwas recorded in the station diary at sr. no. 32. Sanjay Shahane (P.W. 4)\n\ncame to the police station and A.S.I. Satpute (P.W. 11) recorded the report\n\nof&apos; Sanjay (P.W. 4) at Exh. 125. An entry in this behalf was accordingly\n\nmade in the station diary at sr. no.33. Sanjay Shahane (P.W. 4) immediately\n\nleft the police station on receiving message that his uncle Jaikumar (P.W. 2)\n\n\n\n\n \nhad become unconscious. Thereafter at about 2355 hrs., original accused\n\nNo.13 Pratibha came to the police station and gave a report in respect of a\n\nnon-cognizable offence. An entry in respect thereof was made in the station\n\ndiary at sr. no. 34. Original accused No.10 Amol and juvenile offender\n\nRama were referred to the hospital as they had sustained minor injuries. The\n\nXerox copy of the entries in the station diary are Exh. 156. A.P.I. Shinde\n\n(P.W. 12) who was also attached to Police Station, Pathardi took over the\n\ninvestigation of Crime No.33 of 1998 from A.S.I. P.W. 11 Satpute as the\n\ncrime had been registered on the basis of the first information report of\n\nSanjay Shahane (P.W.4). A.P.I. Shinde (P.W. 12) received a copy of the\n\nstatement of Digambar (P.W. 1). On 8.3.1998, A.P.I. Shinde accordingly\n\nvisited the mortuary and drew the inquest panchnama of the dead bodies of\n\nDhananjay and Santosh vide inquest panchnamas at Exhs. 116 and 117 in\n\nthe presence of witnesses. Thereafter on the same day he visited the scene of\n\nthe offence at about 9.30 A.M. and drew the scene of the offence\n\npanchnama at Exh. 111 in the presence of P.W. 1 Digambar. The scene of\n\nthe offence was pointed out by P.W. 4 Sanjay Shahane and the spot is a\n\nnarrow lane to the south of the main road of Pathardi. The narrow lane\n\nwhich is the scene of the offence is known as Rangar Galli. Deceased\n\n\n\n\n \nDhananjay had been killed in front of the house of one Pandurang Kasar\n\nwhile deceased Sanjay had been killed in front of the house of one\n\nBhagirath Bajaj. The lane was of a width of about 4 ft. with stone flooring.\n\nDried bloodstains were noticed in front of the house of Bhagirath Bajaj as\n\nwell as in front of the house of Pandurang Kasar. The distance between the\n\ntwo spots where the murder of deceased Sanjay and deceased Dhananjay\n\nhad been committed is at about 10 ft. The spot panchnama further records\n\nthat at a distance of 25 ft. house of one Vilas Rodi is situated and an electric\n\nbulb is affixed on the door of his house. At a distance of 30 ft. towards the\n\nsouthern side, there is an electric pole with tube light.

','Bhagwan Singh &amp; Ors Vs State Of M.P SETHI, J.\n\n	The appellants, alongwith two others, were charged under Sections 148, 302, 336, 337, 427 read\nwith Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code by the Court of Additional Sessions Judge, Burhanpur and after\ntrial acquitted by the trial court vide its judgment dated 24th June, 1987.  The appeal filed by the State\nagainst the order of acquittal was allowed by the High Court vide the judgment impugned convicting the\nappellants for offences under Section 302/149 and sentencing them to life imprisonment besides paying a\nfine of Rs.5,000/- each in default of which they have been directed to suffer further rigorous imprisonment\nfor one year each.  They were also convicted for the commission of offence under Section 148 IPC and\nsentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year each.\n\n	Not satisfied with the judgment of the High Court, the appellants have preferred this appeal under\nSection 379 of the Code of Criminal Procedure read with Order XXI Rules 12 to 29 of the Supreme Court\nRules, 1966.\n\n	According to the prosecution there was a dispute between Amarnath (deceased) and Ram Singh,\nappellant with respect to four mango trees grown on Khasra No.212 situated at Village Sarai.  Litigation\nwas pending between both the parties and police had registered several cases under Sections 147 and 145 of\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure.	 According to the FIR recorded on the statement of PW22 Jagdish that he\nalong with his family members was watching TV at his house.  Amarnath and Hari Ram were also there.\nWhen he was about to start his meals, they heard the cries of \"Bachao-Bachao\" (save-save) raised by\nSurender.  They saw all the 16 accused persons assaulting Surender with lathis, Dhariya, Khartaliya and\nPata.  When Hari Ram went to intervene, the accused attacked him.  Similarly when Amarnath went\nforward he was also assaulted.	Ram Singh instigated other accused persons to finish Amarnath saying that\nas he was responsible for everything, he should be finished today.  Thereafter Ram Singh, Bhagwan Singh,\nSardar Singh, Roop Singh and Dhyansingh attacked Amarnath with lethal weapons in their possession.\nWitness rushed forward to save his father and was also attacked by the aforesaid accused persons.  He ran\naway to the house to save himself.  The accused then threw stones on the house which broke roof tiles,\ndoors and also damaged the walls.  After registration of the FIR, the investigating officers sent the injured,\nnamely, Surender and Hari Ram to the District Hospital, Khandwa where they died the same night, the\ninformation of which was sent to the police by Hospital Authorities.  Mukesh was also found injured and\nsent for treatment to the hospital.  In the occurrence three persons, namely, Surender, Hari Ram and\nAmarnath were murdered and some of the witnesses injured.\n\n	The trial court acquitted the accused persons on finding that appellants Bhagwan Singh, Ram\nSingh, Roop Singh had received injuries and \"seeing danger of life and other accused utilised right of\nprivate defence and there aggressors died and rest aggressors fled away.  Hence the act of the accused fall\nwithin the definition of right of private defence u/s 100 IPC and their act is not punishable according to\nprovisions of section 96 IPC\".	The trial court further held, \"I find that prosecution failed to prove case\nbeyond reasonable doubts and accused committed murder of deceased Amarnath, Surender and Hariram\nand caused injuries to Mukesh witness and damaged house of Jagdish after throwing stones\". Holding that\nthe prosecution had failed to prove the offence against accused beyond all reasonable doubts and giving\nthem the benefit of right of self-defence, as contemplated under Section 100 IPC, he acquitted the accused\npersons.\n\n	The High Court rightly found that the trial court had been led astray by the simple fact that the\ninjuries on the person of the accused had not been explained by the prosecution witnesses.  After referring\nto number of judgments of this Court, the High Court concluded:\n\n\"In view of what we have discussed about the circumstances\nof the case, the injuries on the persons of the three\ndeceased, the sequence in which the witnesses reached the\nspot of crime, minor nature of the injuries on the persons\nof the accused except one injury on the head of Bhagwan\nSingh and the background and also the sequence in which the\ndeceased were attacked, rules out any possibility of the\naccused having attacked the three deceased in exercise of\nself-defence of any of them.  It is clear that the accused\npersons were the aggressors.\"\n\n\n	After critically and minutely examining the evidence on record,\nthe High Court found that the presence of eye-witnesses, namely, Kiran\n(PW7), Mukesh (PW12) and Jagdish (PW22) cannot be doubted.  In this\nregard the court held:\n\n\"A striking feature of this case is that one of the accused\nSardarsingh lodged a report Ex.D-5 at 11.30 p.m. that 4\npersons i.e. Amarnath, Jagdish, Surendra and Hariram were\nassaulting Bhagwansingh and Roopsingh.	Even here Jagdish\nwitness was shown present and there was no mention of\nRamsingh accused.  Then in cross examination to these three\neye-witnesses the suggestions have been that the deceased\nand the witnesses along with others assaulted the accused at\nthe house of Ramsingh.	The trial court has ignored this\ntrend of cross examination on behalf of the accused in\nappreciating whether the witnesses were present at the scene\nof violence.  In the facts and circumstances of a given\ncase, the trend of cross-examination by defence or\nprosecution witness can provide support to the inference if\nsome accused and witnesses were present at the scene of\ncrime.	The most striking feature is the fact that such a\nreport was recorded by the police and they at one proceeded\nto the scene of crime.	There is no mention in Ex.D-5 if any\nserious injury was given to Sardarsingh or Roopsing and\nwhether any weapon has been used or only fists blows were\nbeing exchanged.  Still the police rushed to the scene of\ncrime at the night.  This is rare.  This indicates that\nthere was some under current working between the police and\nthe accused persons.  The police could not but have recorded\nthe Dehati Nalishi on finding one person died and 2 in the\nprocess of dying with fatal injuries.  This is followed by\nlapse of the investigating officer in recorded statement of\nMukesh and Kiran after 7 days if Kiran had not witnesses the\noccurrence there was no need to introduce her as a witness\nwhen there were witnesses such as Jagdish and Mukesh whose\npresence at that spot could hardly be challenged.  So, if\nanything, investigation was unfair towards the complainant\nparty and not against the accused persons.\"\n\nand concluded:\n\n\"So we find the testimony of these witnesses, trustworthy\nand also confirmatory to each other.  Their presence is\nestablished at the scene of crime.  Their testimony is\ncorroborated by FIR and by medical evidence.\"\n\n	We do not agree with the submissions of the learned counsel for\nthe appellants that under Section 378 of the Code of Criminal Procedure\nthe High Court could not disturb the finding of facts of the trial court\neven if it found that the view taken by the trial court was not proper.\nOn the basis of the pronouncements of this Court, the settled position\nof law regarding the powers of the High Court in an appeal against an\norder of acquittal is that the Court has full powers to review the\nevidence upon which an order of acquittal is based and generally it will\nnot interfere with the order of acquittal because by passing an order of\nacquittal the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused is\nreinforced.  The golden thread which runs through the web of\nadministration of justice in criminal case is that if two views are\npossible on the evidence adduced in the case, one pointing to the guilt\nof the accused and the other to his innocence, the view which is\nfavourable to the accused should be adopted.  Such is not a jurisdiction\nlimitation on the appellate court but a Judge made guidelines for\ncircumspection.	 The paramount consideration of the court is to ensure\nthat miscarriage of justice is avoided.	 A miscarriage of justice which\nmay arise from the acquittal of guilty is no less than from the\nconviction of an innocent.  In a case where the trial court has taken a\nview ignoring the admissible evidence, a duty is cast upon the High\nCourt to reappreciate the evidence in acquittal appeal for the purposes\nof ascertaining as to whether all or any of the accused has committed\nany offence or not.  Probable view taken by the trial court which may\nnot be disturbed in the appeal is such a view which is based upon legal\nand admissible evidence.  In the instant case the trial court acquitted\nthe respondents by not re Code of Criminal Procedure - area 379 - Supreme Court Rules - Order XXI Rules 12 to 29 - advance under - Indian Penal Code - Sections 148, 302, 336, 337, 427 read with Section 149 - offenses under - conviction and sentence under the settled position of law in regards to the forces of the High Court in an interest against a request of quittance is that the court has full powers to survey the proof whereupon a request or vindication is based and for the most part it won\'t meddle with the request of absolution in light of the fact that by passing a request of exoneration the assumption guiltlessness for the denounced is strengthened - for a situation where the trial court has taken a view overlooking the allowable confirmation, an obligation is provided reason to feel ambiguous about the High Court to reappreciate the proof in quittance advance for the motivations behind learning concerning whether all or any of the charged has perpetrated any offense or not - the trial court wrongly held that the respondents were supported in bringing on the demise of three people in practice of their privilege of self-preservation - no legitimacy in offer - rejected. ','Sumatidevi M. Dhanwatay Vs Union Of India And Ors JUDGMENT\n\n2004(3) SCR 928\n\nThe following Judgment of the Court was delivered\n\nThe appellant travelled by 1st Class Air conditioned berth from Nagpur to\nBombay by Howrah-Bombay Mail. She was carrying her luggage which included\ngold, pearl, silver and diamond jewellery and other valuables valued at Rs.\n1,11,756. While she was travelling, she was assaulted by some unauthorised\npassengers and her gold, silver, pearl, diamond and other valuables were\ntaken away forcibly. This incident occurred on 4.12.1991. Thousands of\npersons entered into the compartment and assaulted the passengers,\nincluding the appellant. The said crowd was so violent that they broke the\ndoors, window bars, glass panels, seating berths and toilets etc. This\napart, the crowd committed so many other illegal acts of assaulting the\nbonafide passengers. They molested the women and even raped the young girl\npassengers. The appellant pulled the alarm chain three times, as a result\nof which, the train stopped at Igatpuri Station. She, alongwith other\nbonafide passengers got down at that station. She approached the Railway\nAuthorities for protection, but, without any assistance. On reaching\nBombay, she lodged a complaint with the police about the incident. The\nappellant approached the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission,\nMaharashtra State (hereinafter referred to as &apos;the State Commission&apos;, for\nshort) by filing a complaint claiming compensation of Rs. 9,32,256. The\nState Commission, after considering the material that was placed before it\nand on considering the rival contentions, allowed the claim of the\nappellant partly awarding total compensation of Rs. 1,41,756. The Railway\nadministration, aggrieved by and not satisfied with the said order, filed\nan appeal before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission\n(hereinafter referred to as &apos;the National Commission&apos;, for short). The\nNational Commission, by the order under challenge in this appeal, set aside\nthe order made by the State Commission. Hence this appeal.\n\nThe learned counsel for the appellant strongly contended that the National\nCommission was not right and justified on facts as well as in law in\nupsetting the order passed by the State Commission; the National Commission\nhas set aside the order made by the State Commission without dislodging the\nreasons given by the State Commission in allowing the claim made by the\nappellant; the National Commission has set aside the order of the State\nCommission simply stating that the State Commission was not right in\nupholding that there has been a deficiency in service on the part of the\nRailway administration. The learned counsel added that having regard to the\nfacts found, the State Commission was fully justified in ordering the\ncompensation.\n\nIn opposition, the learned counsel for the respondent Nos. 1 to 4 submitted\nthat the order impugned in this appeal is just and supportable order.\nAccording to her, the State Commission had no jurisdiction to entertain the\ncomplaint made by the appellant; there was no deficiency in service on the\npart of the Railway administration; when an unruly mob entered into the\nrailway compartment and caused damage on the person and property of the\npassengers, the Railway administration was helpless. In such a situation,\nno complaint could be entertained by the State Commission under the\nConsumer Protection Act, 1986.\n\nWe have considered the respective submissions made on behalf of the\nparties. As is evident from the order of the State Commission that opposite\nparties Nos 1, 3, 5 &amp; 6, i.e., Union of India, Chief Security\nCommissioner, Secretary, Home Department and Inspector General of Police,\nremained absent. No written version was filed by any of the parties on the\ndate given. The complaint was posted for final hearing on 14.9.1993, on\nwhich date the Union of India and the General Manager, Central Railway\nfiled written version jointly. The averment made in the complaint that the\nappellant travelled by train on that day when the incident happened, is\nadmitted. However, the Railway administration denied its responsibility as\nto the theft of luggage of the appellant and the injuries suffered by her.\nThe only contention of the Railway administration was that it was not\nresponsible for the toss of luggage and injuries caused to the appellant.\nThe State Commission, on consideration of the facts and circumstances, has\nrecorded that having regard to the past experience, the Railway\nadministration did not take reasonable steps to avoid such incident. It is\nalso recorded in the order of the State Commission that the allegations of\ninjuries suffered by the appellant and the loss caused to her luggage, the\nRailway administration had not been able to controvert effectively. It was\nsubmitted on behalf of the Railway administration before the State\nCommission that the claim as to the loss of ornaments urged by the\nappellant, was exaggerated. As&apos; regards loss of the Bank Draft, it was\ncontended that intimation could be given to the concerned Bank. An argument\nwas also advanced that the complaint was not maintainable under the\nprovisions of  Consumer Act- safety- Compansation- The appellant travelled by 1st Class Air conditioned berth from Nagpur to Bombay by Howrah-Bombay Mail- she was assaulted by some unauthorised passengers and her gold, silver, pearl, diamond and other valuables were taken away forcibly- They molested the women and even raped the young girl passengers. The appellant pulled the alarm chain three times, as a result of which, the train stopped at Igatpuri Station-She, alongwith other bonafide passengers got down at that station. She approached the Railway Authorities for protection, but, without any assistance- she lodged a complaint with the police about the incident. The appellant approached the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Maharashtra State by filing a complaint claiming compensation of Rs. 9,32,256- The State Commission, after considering the material that was placed before it and on considering the rival contentions, allowed the claim of the appellant partly awarding total compensation of Rs. 1,41,756- The Railway administration, aggrieved by and not satisfied with the said order, filed an appeal before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (hereinafter referred to as \'the National Commission\', for short). The National Commission, by the order under challenge in this appeal, set aside the order made by the State Commission. Hence this appeal-under Section 124A of the Railways Act, 1989, the Railway administration cannot escape the liability having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case and in the light of the incident that had taken place. As to the deficiency of service on the part of the Railway administration, no such plea was raised before the State Commission. The Railway administration also did not raise any issue as to the maintainability of the complaint or jurisdiction of the State Commission to deal with the complaint. Even otherwise, under Section 3 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, the complaint could be entertained by the State Commission in the absence of any such plea taken by the Railway administration as to the jurisdiction to entertain the complaint. This being the position, in our view, the impugned order passed by the National Commission cannot be sustained.

MOHAPATRA,J This appeal, filed by accused no.1 Babu Kuttan Ramkrishna Pillai and accused no.2 Umesh @ Babu Purshottam Bhatt of TADA ACT Spl.Case No.33 of 1994, is directed against the judgment and order dated 21.8.1998 of the Designated Court at Brihan `Mumbai under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 (for short TADA Act). In the said case seven accused persons faced trial under Section 120-B read with 307 r/w 34, 307 r/w 114, 307 r/w 149, 387 r/w 34, 143, 144, 147, 148 and 506 (ii), 353 r/w 114 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 3(2)(ii), 3(3), 3(5), 5 and 6 of the TADA Act and section r/w 25(IB)\r\n\r\n(a), Section 5 r/w 27 of the Arms Act. The gist of the prosecution case relevant for the purpose of this proceeding may be stated thus: With the growth of industry, commerce and trade in and around the city of Mumbai which generates substantial quantity of wealth, there has been increase of organised activities by gangs of anti-socials to extract money from affluent sections of society like developers, hoteliers and other businessmen by putting them in fear of death and then to demand substantial sums of money commonly known as &quot;Khadani&quot; i.e. protection money. One such gang was operating in the city under Amar Naik @ Bhai, who died a couple of years before the decision in the case at an encounter with the police. The prosecution alleged that in pursuance of a criminal conspiracy between 15.1.1994 to 16.5.1994 the accused persons and others of the gang embarked upon preparatory acts like procuring the information about the names of the builders of M/s Kalpataru Construction Company which was engaged in developing a property at Pali Hill, named Nakshatra Building. PW-7 Sudhir Tambe was the Senior Vice-President of the company with its head office at Nariman Point. He used to sit in the head- office. PW 6 Pachapur, Civil Engineer, was an employee of the company who used to remain at the site to supervise the construction. As the prosecution story runs, on 15.4.1994 between 11.30 a.m. and 12.00 noon while PW 6 was on duty at the construction site, accused no.3, Nitin Vasant Venugurlekar armed with revolver and accused No.4 Rajindera @ Rajan Mahadeo Margaj armed with a chopper and accused no.5 Jayendra @ Jai Anandrao Jadhav also armed with a chopper visited the site of Nakshatra Building; they threatened the workers at the site, forcibly brought PW 6 Pachapur in a room on the ground floor and man-handled him. Accused no.3, pointing a revolver at him demanded the name, address and telephone number of the builders. PW 6 disclosed the name of PW 7 Tambe and gave his telephone number to them. The accused then asked him to go to the office of the builders at Nariman Point and make the arrangement for a telephonic talk with Tambe. PW 6 rushed to the office and told Tambe of what had happened at the construction site. This was followed by telephonic calls from the accused who wanted to speak to Tambe. Attempts were made by PW 6 and PW 7 to avoid any discussion with the gangsters. Two or three days thereafter when the accused got Tambe on the telephone he (Tambe) gave them some other telephone numbers and asked them to contact those persons including one D.N.Ghosh, the Security Contractor. Eight/ten days thereafter again a telephone call was made to the office of Tambe which was received by PW 6 who was informed by the person making the call that they could not get D. N. Ghosh on the telephone numbers furnished by Tambe. Thereafter PW 6 handed over the receiver to Tambe. This incident was followed by several threats given by the gangsters to workers and also repeated telephone calls made to the Head Office of the company to contact Tambe. The staff of the site office absented from work resulting in virtual closure of construction activity. On 11.5.1994 the deceased Sanjay Patil telephoned to Tambe and warned him that he is wasting time and should meet him without further delay. After some days there was one more similar call from Sanjay Patil and he asked Tambe that he should talk to Bhai and saying so he handed over the receiver to another person who gave his identity as Amar Naik (since deceased), who told Tambe that he should pay Rs.10 lacs. The later pleaded his inability to pay such a heavy sum and after some discussion agreed to pay Rs.5 lacs. He was asked to come to Nakshatra Building site on 16.5.1994 along with money. In the meantime Tambe informed all the happenings to the Addl. Commissioner of Police Mr.Sanjeev Dayal and the then Dy. Commissioner of Police of Zone VII Mr. Rajanish Sheth within whose jurisdiction Khar Police Station fell.\r\n\r\nOn 16.5.1994 at about 12.00 noon the deceased Sanjay Patil telephoned Tambe and inquired from him as to what he was going to do about the payment and then Tambe replied that he will be leaving office at about 2.00 p.m. for Pali Hill. Sanjay Patil cautioned him that he should not make any haste and he should wait for his call so that he will take necessary instructions from his boss i.e. Amar Naik. At about 2.00 p.m. on that day there was a telephone call from Sanjay Patil telling that Tambe should not meet him at the Nakshatra Building site but instead he should meet him near the Ceaser Palace Hotel. This telephonic conversation was tape-recorded. Tambe was instructed on telephone that his man shall carry a white plastic bag containing the amount of Rs.5 lacs and shall wait near the entrance gate of Ceaser\r\n Indian Penal Code Section 120-B r/w 307, 34 likewise 307, r/w 114, 149 and 387 r/w 34, 143, 144, 147, 148 and 506(ii), 353 r/w 114 - Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 `TADA Act&#39; 25(IB)(a) - the Arms Act Section 5, 27 - Indian Penal Code, Section 120-B and 395 considered as saw - charged sentenced detainment for a long time - We do not find that the appreciation of evidence made by the learned trial Judge suffers from any illegality nor can findings recorded by him be said to be perverse- Appeal rejected.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n Appeal Dismissed','Shamkant Narayan Despande Vs Maharashtra Industrial CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Special Leave petition (c) No.\n4748 of 1991.\nFrom the Judgment and Order dated 21.1.91 of the Bombay High\nCourt in W.P. No. 3481 of 1990.\nN.B. Shetye,  P.M.  Pradhan  and  A.M.	khanwilkar  for	 the\npetitioner.\nDushyant Dave, Beliram Vakil, Abrar Ali, Ajit Yogi, Gajender\nLal, Mukul Gupta and Ms. Sonia Khan for the Respondents.\nThe Judgment of the court was delivered by\n     SAWANT,  J.   The	petitioner  is	diploma-  holder  in\nEngineering  and holds the post of Executive Engineer in the\nrespondent-Corporation. Till 1974, the promotion post of the\nsuperintending Engineer	 was  available	 both  for  diploma-\nholders and degree-holders according to merit-cum-seniority.\nThis was  so according	to  the	 practice  followed  by	 the\nCorporation without  making any	 rules or regulation in that\nbehalf. In  1974, the corporation made regulation by passing\na resolution  by passing a resolution and continued the same\npractice. Admittedly,  the regulation  were not	 made  under\nsection 64  of the  Maharashtra Industrial  Development Act,\n1961 [hereinafter  referred to as the &apos;Act&apos;] under which the\nrespondent-corporation was  created. Thereafter in 1988, the\ncorporation passed a resolution, for the first time,. making\n75 per	cent of	   the	posts  of  superintending  engineers\navailable to  the executive Engineers holding degrees and 25\nper cent  to  the  Executive  Engineers	 who  were  diploma-\nholders.  This	 resolution  was   also	 admittedly   not  a\nregulation made	 under the   said  section 64.	But for this\nresolution, the	 petitioner who was senior to respondent NO.\n2 would	 have been  promoted to	 the post  of Superintending\nEngineer on  31st October,  1990. However,  since respondent\nNo.2 was a degree holder, he got the said resolution and was\npromoted to the said post on that date. It is this promotion\nwhich was challenged by the petitioner by a writ petition in\nthe High  Court. The  High Court  by the  impugned  judgment\ndismissed the said petition.\n     2.	 Two   contentions  were  raised\n     before us.\n     (i) that no classification could be\n     made among	 the Executive Engineers\n     on the  basis of  their educational\n     qualification for	the  purpose  of\n     promotion	 to    the    post    of\n     superintending Engineer, since they\n     belong  to	  the  same   cadre   of\n     Executive Engineers and do the same\n     work.  There   was	 also  a  common\n     seniority	  of	the    Executive\n     Engineers	maintained.   hence  the\n     classification  was  discriminatory\n     in nature and violative of Articles\n     14 and 16 of the Constitution .\n     (ii)  that	  if  at   all	such   a\n     discrimination was	 permissible, it\n     could be  made only  be a statutory\n     rule  or  regulation  framed  under\n     Section 64	 of the said Act. A mere\n     resolution	   or	 an    executive\n     instruction could	not effect  such\n     discrimination.\n3.   We find  not merit in either of the two contentions. It\nis now	well settled  that for	the purpose  of promotion, a\nvalid classification  can made among the members holding the\nsame post  on the  basis of their qualification. In state of\nJummu &amp;	 Kashmir v.  Triloki Nath Khosa &amp; Ors., [1974] 1 SCR\n771, a Constitution Bench of his court has clearly held that\nsuch a	classification is  permissible and  does not violate\nArticles 14  and  16  of  the  Constitution  the  Court	 has\nobserved there that in state of Mysore &amp; Anr. v. P. Narasing\nRao, [1968]  1 SCR  407 and The Union of India and others v.\nDr.(Mrs.) S.B.	Kholi, AIR  1973 SC 811, it was already held\nthat   classification	 on   the   basis   of	 educational\nqualification was  permissible. The  Court then	 referred to\nRoshan Lal  Tandon v.  Union of India, [1968] 1 SCR  185 and\ndistinguished it  on the facts by pointing out that it was a\ncase of	 the direct  recruits and  promotees integrated into\none cadre.  Once they  were integrated they lost their birth\nbirth-marks, viz.  the different   sources  from which	they\nwere recruited.	 [Emphasis supplied].  The court pointed out\nthat Roshan Lal&apos;s case [supra] was thus no authority for the\nproposition that  if direct  recruits  and    promotees	 are\nintegrated into	 one class  they cannot	 be  classified	 for\npurposed of promotion on a basis other than that in the case\nbefore the them the classified for purpose of promotion on a\nbasis  other  than  that  they	were  drawn  from  different\nsources. The  court also  pointed out  that the	 very  Bench\nwhich decided  Roshan Lal&apos;s    case  [supra]  he Constitution of India, Art.14, Art.16 - Promotion to post of Superintending Engineer - Classification of degree-holder and confirmation holder Executive Engineers - Not violative Arts. 14 and 16. \r\n\r\nMaharashtra Industrial Development Act (3 of 1962), S.64. \r\n\r\nAIR 1983 SC 881, Held per incuriam. \r\n\r\nAIR 1974 SC 1, Foll. \r\n\r\nAdvancement - Classification among same class on premise of capabilities - Permissible. \r\n\r\nMaharashtra Industrial Development Act (3 of 1962), S.63 - Promotion to post of Superintending Engineer - Classification of degree holder and confirmation holder Executive Engineers - Made by Corporation by passing simple determination - Not illicit. \r\n\r\nAuthoritative law - Change in administration condition by passing simple determination - allowable. \r\n\r\nStates of Service - Can be changed by official guidelines.\r\n\r\nheld: The proposition that in the absence of the rules and regulations, the authority can act by executive instruction finds direct support in Mysore state Road Transport Corporation v.

In\nregard to  the first  ground, the trial Court found that the\ntenant was\n \nin arrears  of payment	of rent	 but  that  the	 tenant	 was\nentitled to the Protection of s. 12(3) of the Madhya Pradesh\nAccommodation Control Act, 1961, as the tenant had deposited\nthe arrears  of rent within the time allowed by the Court on\nhis application.  When the  appeal preferred by the landlord\nwas pending before the Additional District Judge, Satna, the\ntenant filed  an application  for condonation  of delay R in\ndepositing the	rent,  month  by  month,  which	 had  become\npayable after  the filing  of the  suit, as stipulated by s.\n13(1) of  the Act.  It appears	that, on  several occasions,\nwhen the  suit and  the appeal were pending before the trial\ncourt and  the appellate  court respectively, the tenant had\ndeposited the monthly rent a day or two or three, beyond the\nprescribed date.  The amount  had been received by the court\nand drawn  out	by  the	 landlord,  apparently	without	 any\nprotest. Taking	 advantage of  the filing  of  the  tenant&apos;s\napplication for condonation of delay, the landlord contended\nthat the  court had  no power to extend the time for deposit\nof the monthly rent and that he was entitled to a decree for\neviction  consequent   on  the	 non-compliance	  with	 the\nprovisions  of	 s.  13	  (  1	 )  of	the  Madhya  Pradesh\nAccommodation Control Act. The appellate court negatived the\nlandlord&apos;s contention and dismissed the appeal. The landlord\npreferred a  Second Appeal  to	the  High  Court  of  Madhya\nPradesh. The High Court, holding that the court had no power\nto extend  time, decreed  the suit for eviction. The tenant,\nhaving obtained special leave, has appealed to this Court.\n     Shri  Khanduja,  learned  counsel	for  the  appellant,\nraised two  contentions before	us. The first contention was\nthat the  High Court was wrong in holding that the Court had\nno power to condone the delay in depositing the monthly rent\nfalling due  after the	filing of the suit for eviction. The\nsecond contention  was that,  in the  circumstances  of	 the\ncase. the  respondent must  be considered  to have waived or\nabandoned the right to insist on dis-entitling the tenant of\nthe protection	to which  he was  otherwise  entitled.	Shri\nNaik, learned  counsel for  the respondent, contended to the\ncontrary on both the questions.\n     The Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Control Act, 1961, was\nenacted, as recited in the statement of objects and reasons,\n\"for the  purpose of  controlling, letting  of and  rents of\nresidential  and  nonresidential  accommodation	 and  giving\nadequate protection  to tenants	 of  such  accommodation  in\nareas where there is dearth of accommodation\". Section 12(1)\nof the	Act provides  that no  suit shall  be-filed ill	 any\ncivil court  against a	tenant for  his	 eviction  from	 any\naccommodation except on one or more of the grounds specified\ntherein. Several  grounds are specified, such as, failure to\npay the	 arrears of  rent after	 the service  of  notice  of\ndemand, unlawful sub-letting of the whole or\n \npart of	 the accommodation, creation of a nuisance, bonafide\nrequirement of the accommodation by the landlord for his own\noccupation,   causing	of   substantial   damage   to	 the\naccommodation  etc.  etc.  The	ground	with  which  we	 are\nconcerned is that mentioned in s. 12(1) (a) and-it is: \"that\nthe tenant  has neither	 paid nor  tendered the whole of the\narrears of  rent legally  recoverable from  him	 within	 two\nmonths of  the date  on which  a notice	 of demand  for	 the\narrears of  rent has  been served  on him by the landlord in\nthe prescribed	manner\". Thus,	where a tenant is in arrears\nof rent,  a landlord  is obliged,  before instituting a suit\nfor eviction  on that  ground, to  serve a  notice of demand\ncalling upon  the tenant  to pay  or tender the whole of the\narrears of  rent within two months of the date of service of\nthe notice. S. 12(3) provides that an order for the eviction\nof a  tenant shall not be made on the ground specified in s.\n12(1) (a),  if	the  tenant  makes  payment  or	 deposit  as\nrequired by  s. 13. S. 13,sub-ss. (1), (5) and (6) which are\nrelevant for the present purpose are as follows:\n	  \"13. (1)  on a suit or proceeding being instituted\n     by the landlord on any of the grounds referred to in s.\n     12, the  tenant shall,  within one month of the service\n     of the  writ of  summons on  him or within such further\n     time as  the Court	 may, on  an application made to it,\n     allow in  this behalf,  deposit in	 the Court or pay to\n     the landlord  an amount  calculated at the rate of rent\n     at which  it was  paid, for  the period  for which	 the\n     tenant may	 have  made  default  including	 the  period\n     subsequent thereto	 up to the end of the month previous\n     to that  in which	the deposit  or payment	 is made and\n     shall thereafter  continue to  deposit or pay, month by\n     month, by	the 15th  of each  succeeding  month  a	 sum\n     equivalent to the rent at that rate.\n     xx		xx	  xx	    xx	     xx\n	  (5) If  a  tenant  makes  deposit  or	 payment  as\n     required by  sub-section (1)  or  sub-section  (2),  no\n     decree or	order shall  be made  by the  Court for	 the\n     recovery of  possession of	 the  accommodation  on	 the\n     ground of default in the payment of rent by the tenant,\n     but the Court may allow such cost as it may deem fit to\n     the  The respondent-landlord	sought	 expulsion of	 the \r\n\r\nappealing party occupant from the suit	 premises for inability to pay \r\n\r\nunpaid debts of lease, regardless of administration of notice of interest. The \r\n\r\ntrial court found that the occupant was falling behind financially o. installment \r\n\r\nof lease, however the inhabitant having stored the back payments of lease \r\n\r\ninside the time permitted by the court on his application the \r\n\r\noccupant was qualified for benefit the security of segment 12(3) \r\n\r\nof the	Madhya Pradesh	Accommodation Control Act. 1961. furthermore, \r\n\r\nexpelled the suit for expulsion. \r\n\r\nThe proprietor favored an interest keeping in mind the same was \r\n\r\npending? the occupant recorded an application under area 13(1) \r\n\r\nof the	Act for	 approbation of	 delay in depositing,,	 the \r\n\r\nlease, month by month.	which had turned out to be payable after the \r\n\r\ndocumenting of the suit. On a few events, when the suit and \r\n\r\nthe interest were pending under the watchful eye of the trial court and	 the \r\n\r\ninvestigative court	 separately, the inhabitant had saved the \r\n\r\nmonth to month lease a day or a few past the endorsed \r\n\r\ndate, and the same had been gotten by the court and drawn \r\n\r\nout by	the landowner, with no dissent. The landowner, \r\n\r\nexploiting the documenting of the occupant s application \r\n\r\nfor condonation	 of postponement, fought that the court had no \r\n\r\nenergy to amplify the ideal opportunity for store of the month to month lease and \r\n\r\nthat he	 was qualified for an announcement for expulsion resulting on \r\n\r\nthe resistance with the arrangements of area 13(1) of \r\n\r\nthe Act. The redrafting court negatived this dispute and \r\n\r\nrejected the interest. In the second interest favored by the \r\n\r\nproprietor, the High Court held that the Court had no energy to \r\n\r\nbroaden time and declared the Suit for ousting. \r\n\r\nIn the occupant\'s interest to this Court on the question \r\n\r\nwhether the Court ha(l. the ability to overlook the deferral in \r\n\r\nsaving the month to month lease falling due after the filling of \r\n\r\nthe suit for ousting. \r\n\r\n^ \r\n\r\nHELD :1. The court had the purview to augment time \r\n\r\nfor store or installment of month to month lease falling due after the \r\n\r\nrecording of the suit. [338 G] \r\n\r\n2. Keeping in mind the end goal to qualifies an inhabitant for claim the insurance \r\n\r\nof area 12(3). the inhabitant needed to make installment or store \r\n\r\nas required by section	 13. The unfulfilled obligations of lease ought to be \r\n\r\npaid or	 stored inside one month of the administration of the \r\n\r\nwrit of summons on the inhabitant or inside such further time as \r\n\r\nmay he	allowed by the court, and ought to further store or \r\n\r\npay each month by the fifteenth. a whole identical to the lease. \r\n\r\n[338 A-B]. \r\n\r\n335 \r\n\r\n3. Failure	 to pay	 or store a whole identical to the \r\n\r\nlease by	 the fifteenth of consistently, ensuing to the recording \r\n\r\nof the	suit for removal will	 not entitle the proprietor, \r\n\r\nstraightaway, to a declaration for removal. The results of \r\n\r\nthe store or payment	 and non-installment or non-store are \r\n\r\nrecommended by subsection and (6) of segment 13. [338 B] \r\n\r\n4. A circumspection is vested in the court under segment \r\n\r\n13(6) to arrange the striking out of the, protection against \r\n\r\nexpulsion. [338 D] \r\n\r\n5. In the event that the court has the	discretion not to strike out \r\n\r\nthe protection or an inhabitant submitting default in installment or \r\n\r\nstore of lease as required by segment 13(1), the court \r\n\r\nmost likely has the further tact to approve the default and \r\n\r\namplify the ideal opportunity for installment or store. Such a tact is \r\n\r\na fundamental ramifications of the tact not to strike out \r\n\r\nthe defence.	Any other development may	lead, to a \r\n\r\ncorruption of the question of the Act. to be specific, \'the satisfactory \r\n\r\nsecurity of the occupant.\' [338 F-G] \r\n\r\n6. Section	 12(3) qualifies an inhabitant for claim insurance \r\n\r\nagainst removal on the ground indicated in area 12(1)(a) \r\n\r\nin the event that he makes installment or store as required by area 13. As \r\n\r\nthe court has under area 13, the ability to degree: the \r\n\r\ntime for installment or store, installment or store, inside the \r\n\r\naugmented time	 will entitle	 the inhabitant to claim	 the \r\n\r\ninsurance of segment 12(3). [338 H] 1 \r\n\r\n7. Express	 arrangement for augmentation of time for store \r\n\r\non the other hand installment or lease falling due after the documenting of the suit \r\n\r\nwas not	 made in area 13(1!	 as the	 result of non- \r\n\r\ninstallment was managed with	 by a different sub-area, segment \r\n\r\n13(6). The watchfulness given to the court under segment 13(6) \r\n\r\nmust suggest a caution to excuse the postponement and broaden the \r\n\r\ntime in	 making deposit	 or installment under area 13(1). \r\n\r\n[339A, E] \r\n\r\nJagdish Kapoor v.

In this case the appellant (hereinafter called\nthe  assessee) was assessed for the assessment year  1956-57\non  a  total income of Rs. 8,400.  The	Income	Tax  Officer\nlater  on came to know that the assessee&apos;s income  from	 the\nsale  of  estates had escaped assessment.  The	Income	Tax\nOfficer	 took action under section 34(1) (a) of	 the  Income\nTax   Act,  1922  (hereinafter	called	the  Act)  for	 the\nassessment year 1956-57 on 13th August, 1959.\nUnder  an  agreement dated 18th May, 1955 a  company  called\nMundakayam  Valley  Rubber Co. Ltd. sold  and  delivered  an\nestate called Kuttikal Estate to one Mr. A. V. George.	 The\narea  of the estate was 477 acres and 71 cents.	 Mr.  A.  V.\nGeorge had entered into the agreement in his own name and on\nbehalf of another company called the Kailas Rubber Co.	Ltd.\nIt  was agreed that the vendor would execute  the  necessary\nconveyance  in favour of Mr. A. V. George or  his  nominees.\nOn 15th August. 1955. the assessee entered into an agreement\nwith  Mr.  A.  V.  George whereby  the	assessee  agreed  to\npurchase  477.71 acres forming part of Kuttikal	 Estate	 for\nRs.  6	lakhs.	An advance of Rs. 1 1,000 was paid  by	the\nassessee.  The balance of Rs. 5,89,000 was to be paid by the\nassessee  on or before 25th September, 1955.  It was  agreed\nthat  Mr. A.  V. George should execute a sale-deed  himself\nor cause it to be executed Kailas Rubber Co. Ltd. on\n \nwhose behalf he was acting in favour of the assessee or	 his\nnominees.   The	 assessee subsequently divided the  area  of\n477.71	acres into 23 plots and found purchasers for  22  of\nthese,	plots.	 The total extent of 22 plots for  which  he\nfound  purchasers was 373.58 acres and the total price	paid\nby  the	 22 purchasers was Rs. 5,18,500.  A  sale  deed	 was\nexecuted  by the Mundakayam Valley Rubber Co. Ltd.  on	31st\nMarch, 1956.  It covered all the 23 plots.  The 22 plots for\nwhich  the  assessee found purchasers were conveyed  to	 the\nrespective purchasers and the 23rd plot was conveyed to	 the\nassesses  himself.  Mr. A. V. George and the  Kailas  Rubber\nCo. Ltd. were parties to this document.	 The plot which	 the\nassessee  had  retained	 for himself  was  104.13  acres  in\nextent.	  Its value was estimated by the Income Tax  Officer\nat  Rs.	 2,08,000.  The Income Tax Officer  worked  out	 the\nprofit from the transaction of purchase and sale of land  as\nfollows\n\"Sale price of 373 acres		Rs.   5,18,500\nValue of 104 acres retained by\nthe assessee at Rs. 2,000 per acre	   Rs. 2,08,000\n				   \n					  Rs. 7,26,500\n Less Cost				  Rs. 6,00,000\n				     \n					  Rs. 1,26,500\nThe  Income Tax Officer held that a sum of Rs.	1,25,000  in\nround  figures	represented the assessee&apos;s  profit  from  an\nadventure in the nature of trade and included this amount in\nhis  total  income under section 34(1)(a) of the  Act.	 The\nassessee  appealed to the Appellate  Assistant	Commissioner\nwho  rejected the appeal.  The assessee took the  matter  in\nfurther appeal to the Appellate Tribunal which also rejected\nthe   appeal  holding  that  the  amount  of  Rs.   1,25,000\nrepresented profit from an adventure in the nature of trade.\nAt  the	 instance  of the assessee  the	 Appellate  Tribunal\nstated a case to the High Court on the following question of\nlaw\n	      \"Whether on the facts and in the circumstances\n	      of  the case, the transactions  constituted  a\n	      venture in the nature of trade and the surplus\n	      of Rs. 1,25,000 was assessable to tax\nBy its. judgment dated 10th October, 1966, the High Court of\nKerala answered the question in the affirmative and  against\nthe assessee.  This appeal is brought by special leave	from\nthe  judgment  of  the	High Court  of	Kerala,	 dated	10th\nOctober, 1966 in Income Tax Reference No, 18 of 1965,\n \nThe  question whether a transaction is an adventure  in	 the\nnature	of trade must be decided on a consideration  of	 all\nthe relevant facts and circumstances which are proved in the\nparticular case.  The answer to the question does not depend\nupon  the application of any abstract rifle or principle  or\nformula but must depend upon the total impression and effect\nof  all the relevant facts and circumstances established  in\nthe  particular	 case.	In. California Copper  Syndicate  v.\nHarris,(1) Lord Justice Clerk, observed\n	      \"It  is  quite  a well  settled  principle  in\n	      dealing with questions of assessment of income\n	      tax  that	 where	the  owner  of	an  ordinary\n	      investment chooses to realise it, and  obtains\n	      a	 greater  price for it	than  he  originally\n	      acquired	it  at	the enhanced  price  is	 not\n	      profit  assessable to income tax.	 But  it  is\n	      equally well established that enhanced  values\n	      obtained	from  realisation or  conversion  of\n	      securities may be so assessable where what  is\n	      done is not merely a realisation or change  of\n	      investment,  but an act done in what is  truly\n	      the  carrying  on,  or  carrying	out,  of   a\n	      business.	  What is the line  which  separates\n	      the  two classes of cases may be difficult  to\n	      define,  and  each  case	must  be  considered\n	      according	 to  its facts; the question  to  be\n	      determined  being-Is the sum of gain that	 has\n	      been  made  a  mere enhancement  of  value  by\n	      realising	 a security or is it a gain made  in\n	      the  operation of business in carrying  out  a\n	      scheme for profit making ?\"\nBut  in judging the character of such  transactions  several\nfactors	 have been treated as significant in decided  cases.\nFor instance, if a transaction related to the business which\nis normally carried on by the assessee, though not  directly\na  part of it, an intention to launch upon an  adventure  in\nthe  nature  of trade may readily be  inferred.	  A  similar\ninference  would  arise where a commodity is  purchased	 and\nsub-divided,  altered,	treated or repaired and sold  or  is\nconverted  into	 a different commodity and then	 sold.	 The\nmagnitude of the transaction of purchase, the nature of	 the\ncommodity,  the	 subsequent dealings of	 the  assessee,	 the\nnature of the Organisation employed by the assessee and	 the\nmanner of disposal may be such that, the transaction may  be\nstamped	 with the character of a trading nature.  In  Martin\nv.  Lowry, (2) the assessee purchased a large  quantity of\naeroplane  linen and sold it in different lots, and for	 the\npurpose of  selling it started	an  advertising	 campaign,\nrented	offices	  engaged an advertising  manager,  a  linen\nexpert	and  a	staff of clerks.  maintained  account  books\nnormally used by a trader, and passed receipts add payment\n(1) [1904] 5 S.T.C. 159,16-66.\n(2) 11 Tax Cases 297.\n \nin  connection	with the linen through	a  separate  banking\naccount.,  It  was  held that the  assessee  carried  on  an\nadventure  in  the  nature of trade and so  the	 profit	 was\nliable to be taxed.  The same view was taken in Rutledge  v.\nCommissioners of Inland Revenue(1) in regard to an  assessee\nwho  purchased very cheaply a vast quantity of toilet  paper\nand   within  a	 short	time  thereafter  sold	 the   whole\nconsignment   at  a  considerable  profit.   Similarly,	  in\nCommissioner of Inland Revenue v. Fraser (2) the assessee, a\nwoodcutter,  bought  for resale, whisky in  bond,  in  three\n&apos;lots.	 He  sold it later on at considerable  profit.	 The\nassessee had never dealt in whisky before, he had no special\nknowledge  of  the  trade he did not take  delivery  of	 the\nwhisky	nor did he have it blended and advertised.  Even  so\nit  was	 held that the transaction was an adventure  in	 the\nnature	of  trade.  Lord President Normand observed  in	 the\ncourse of the judgment :\n	      \"It  is  in general more easy to hold  that  a\n	      single   transaction   entered  into   by	  an\n	      individual  in  the  line	 of  his  own  trade\n	      (although not part and parcel of his  ordinary\n	      business)	 is  an adventure in the  nature  of\n	      trade than to hold that a transaction  entered\n	      into by an individual outside the line of	 his\n	      own trade or occupation is an adventure in the\n	      nature of trade.	But what is a good deal more\n	      important	 is  the nature of  the	 transaction\n	      with reference to the commodity dealt in.	 The\n	      individual  who enters into a purchase  of  an\n	      article  or  commodity may have  in  view	 the\n	      resale  of it at a profit, and yet it  may  be\n	      that  is	not the only purpose  for  which  he\n	      purchased	 the article of the  commodity,	 nor\n	      the only purpose to which he might turn it  if\n	      favourable opportunity of sale does not occur.\n	      In some of the cases the purchase of a picture\n	      has been given as an illustration.  An amateur\n	      may  purchase  a picture with a  view  to	 its\n	      resale  at a profit, and yet he may  recognise\n	      at the time or afterwards that the  possession\n	      of   the	picture	 will  give  him   aesthetic\n	      enjoyment	 if he is unable ultimately,  or  at\n	      his chosen time, to realise it at a profit.  A\n	      man may purchase stocks and shares with a view\n	      to selling them at an early date at a  profit,\n	      but, if he does so, he is purchasing something\n	      which  is	 itself an investment,	a  potential\n	      source of revenue to him while he holds it.  A\n	      man may purchase land with a view to realising\n	      it  at a profit, but it also may yield him  an\n	      income  while he continues to hold it.  If  he\n	      continues	 to  hold it, there may	 be  also  a\n	      certain pride of possession But the  purchaser\n	      of  a  large  quantity  of  a  commodity	like\n	      whisky,  greatly	in excess of what  could  be\n	      used by\n	      (1) 14Tax Cases490.\n	      (2) 24 Tax Cases 498.\n \n	      himself,	his family and friends, a  commodity\n	      which  yields  no pride of  possession,  which\n	      cannot  be  turned  to account  except  by.  a\n	      process	of  realisation,  I   can   scarcely\n	      consider	to be other than an adventure  in  a\n	      transaction  in the nature of a trade;  and  I\n	      can find no single fact among those stated  by\n	      the  Commissioners which in any way  traverses\n	      that  view.  In my opinion, the fact that	 the\n	      transaction  was	not in the way	of  business\n	      (whatever it was) of the respondent in no	 way\n	      alters the character which almost	 necessarily\n	      belongs to a transaction like this\".\nThese are cases of commercial commodities but a	 transaction\nof purchase of land cannot be assumed without more to be  an\nadventure in the nature of trade.  In Leeming v. Jones,(1) a\nsyndicate  was	formed to acquire an option  over  a  rubber\nestate with a view to resell it at a profit, and finding the\nestate	too small the syndicate acquired another estate	 and\nsold  the  two	estates on profit.  It	was  held  that	 the\ntransaction  was not in the nature of trade and	 the  profit\nwas  not  liable to be assessed to tax.	 The same  view	 was\nexpressed in Saroj Kumar Mazumdar v. Commissioner of  Income\nTax  (2)  in which the assessee who carried on	business  of\nengineering   works   purchased	 land,	 which	 was   under\nrequisition by the Government, negotiated a sale before	 the\nland  was  de-requisitioned and sold it after the  land	 was\nreleased.   But the circumstances of a particular  case	 may\nlead to the conclusion that the purchaser resale of land  is\nin  the	 nature of trade.  In Venkataswami Naidu  &amp;  Co.  v.\nCommissioner of Income Tax(3) the appellant firm which acted\nas  managing agents purchas  the appellant was assessed for the assessment year 1956-57 on a total income of Rs. 8,400. The Income Tax Officer later on came to know that the assessee\'s income from the sale of estates had escaped assessment. The Income Tax Officer took action under section 34(1) (a) of the Income Tax Act, 1922 for the assessment year 1956-57 on 13th August, 1959. Under an agreement dated 18th May, 1955 a company called Mundakayam Valley Rubber Co. Ltd. sold and delivered an estate called Kuttikal Estate to one Mr. A. V. George. The area of the estate was 477 acres and 71 cents. Mr. A. V. George had entered into the agreement in his own name and on behalf of another company called the Kailas Rubber Co. Ltd. It was agreed that the vendor would execute the necessary conveyance in favour of Mr. A. V. George or his nominees. On 15th August. 1955. the assessee entered into an agreement with Mr. A. V. George whereby the assessee agreed to purchase 477.71 acres forming part of Kuttikal Estate for Rs. 6 lakhs. An advance of Rs. 1 1,000 was paid by the assessee. The balance of Rs. 5,89,000 was to be paid by the assessee on or before 25th September, 1955. It was agreed that Mr. A. V. George should execute a sale-deed himself or cause it to be executed Kailas Rubber Co. Ltd. on whose behalf he was acting in favour of the assessee or his nominees. The assessee subsequently divided the area of 477.71 acres into 23 plots and found purchasers for 22 of these, plots. The total extent of 22 plots for which he found purchasers was 373.58 acres and the total price paid by the 22 purchasers was Rs. 5,18,500. A sale deed was executed by the Mundakayam Valley Rubber Co. Ltd. on 31st March, 1956. It covered all the 23 plots. The 22 plots for which the assessee found purchasers were conveyed to the respective purchasers and the 23rd plot was conveyed to the assesses himself. Mr. A. V. George and the Kailas Rubber Co. Ltd. were parties to this document. The plot which the assessee had retained for himself was 104.13 acres in extent. Its value was estimated by the Income Tax Officer at Rs. 2,08,000. \r\nheld: he Income-tax authorities have correctly estimated the profit of the assessee by treating the land as stock-in-trade and valuing it according to the normal accountancy practice. \r\nappeal dismissed ','Bakhshish Singh Vs Union Of India (Uoi) And Ors. JUDGMENT\n  \n\nO. Chinnappa Reddy, J.\n \n\n1. Bakhshish Singh, the appellant, was appointed an Assistant in the Punjab Civil Secretariat on December 7, 1948 and was confirmed on September 1, 1956. Manohar Singh, Sardar Singh, D. Justin and Prithipal Singh Chawala, respondents 3 to 6 were also Assistants in &apos;. the Punjab Civil Secretariat, but were junior to the appellant. All of them were working as Assistants on November 1, 1956 when consequent on the State&apos;s Reorganisation Act, the former States of Punjab and PEPSU were merged into one State. On merger the conditions of service of those employed by the former States of Punjab and PEPSU were protected as provided by Sections 115(7) and 117 of the State&apos;s Reorganisation Act. The rules in force at that time, which governed them, were the Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Services Class III) Rules, 1952. Rule 6(1)(b) provided that posts of Superintendents, Records in the service were to be filled by selection among Assistants. Posts of Assistants-in-charge were to be filled (i) by promotion of Assistants; or (ii) by transfer or deputation of an official already in Government service. Rule 6 (1) (c) provided that posts of Assistants-in-charge were to be filled (i) by promotion of Assistants; or (ii) by transfer or deputation of an official already in Government service. Rule 6(I)(d) provided that the post of Superintendent, Military Secretary to Governor&apos;s office was to be filled by selection amongst\n Assistant. In October, 1963, the posts of Superintendents were made class II posts and came to be governed by the Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Service Class II) Rules. Rule 8(1)(a) provided that posts of Superintendents other than the Superintendent in the Press Branch were to be made (i) by promotion from amongst Deputy Superintendents, Assistants-in-charge and Assistants, who are members of the Punjab Civil Secretariat\n (State Service Class III) with minimum experience of one year as Deputy Superintendent or a total experience of 10 years as an Assistant; or (ii) by direct recruitment or by transfer or deputation of an official already in Government service holding a ministerial post. We are not concerned with the proviso to Rule 8(I)(a). Rule 8(I)(b) dealt with the post of Superintendent, Press Branch with which also we are not concerned. While this was so, as an experimental measure some posts of Assistant Section Officers were created which were not posts which belonged either to the Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Services Class III) or Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Services Class II). Appointment\n to these posts were to be made from Assistants belonging to the Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Services Class III) on the basis of an examination to be held by the Public Service Commission. Respondents 3 to 6 were selected and appointed as Assistant Section Officers as they were successful in the examination. The appellant either did not appear at the examination or was not successful at the examination. Therefore, he continued as Assistant in the Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Service Class III). By an order dated March 14, 1961, the Government expressly provided that the seniority of those appointed as Assistant Section Officers in their normal lines as Assistants will remain unchanged and that their promotion as Deputy Superintendents/Superintendents will be governed by their seniority as Assistants. Even so some Assistant Section Officers were promoted as Superintendents without reference to their seniority as Assistants. The promotions were quashed by the Punjab High Court in Roshan Lal Sharma&apos;s 1966 Ct. L J. 848 case. The State of Punjab thereupon thought fit to amend the Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Services Class II) by introducing a new Rule 8(I)(a)(i) in the place of the old Rule 8(I)(a)(i) which was as follows :-\n (i) By promotion from amongst Assistant Section Officers and such Deputy Superintendents, Assistants-in-charge and Assistants as are member of the Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Service Class III) with minimum experience of one year as a Deputy Superintendent or a total experience of ten years as an Assistant. \n \n\nTwo explanations were added and Explanation II provided that the number of posts of Superintendent and Section Officers available for promotion from amongst\n Assistant Section Officers shall bear the some proportion to the total number of such posts as the branch manned by Assistant Section Officers and Section Officers bear to the number of branches manned by Assistants and Superintendents, the method of promotion to vacancies available in such proportion being that persons, other than the Assistant Section Officers shall be promoted first and the Assistant Section Officers shall be promoted thereafter and so on. The Government of Punjab thought it advisable to obtain the approval of the Central Government as the High Court in Roshan Lal Sharma&apos;s case had said that the promotion of Assistant Section Officers to the posts of Superintendents based on their seniority as Assistant Section Officers was violative of the guarantees given by the State&apos;s Reorganisation Act. After seeking some clarification from the State Government, the Government of India wrote to the State Government as follows : -\n \n \n\nNo. 17/57/66-SR (S)\n \n\nGovernment of India/Ministry of Home Affairs.\n \n\nTo \n\nThe Chief Secretary to Government of Punjab, Secretariat Administration, Chandigarh.\n \n\nNew Delhi-1, the 20th May, 1967.\n \n\nSub : Integration of Services in Punjab-Rules for promotion to the post of Superintendent-Provision for promotion of Assistant Section Officers-Approval of the Central Government under the S.R.

In view of the fact that under the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, retrospective approval cann  Service- state of administration - Sections 115 and 117 of States Reorganization Act, 1956 and Rules 6 (I) and 8 (I) of Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Service Class III) Rules,1952 - claim against expulsion of request of testing advancement of respondents - respondents were junior to appellants - litigant fought ensure given to litigant by Sections115 (7) and 117 abused if there should be an occurrence of making of posts of Assistant Section Officers and by arrangement of advancement to posts of Superintendent in Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Service Class II) - making of new posts outside Class III administration and making people holding those posts qualified for advancement decreased odds of advancement of Assistants having a place with Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Service Class III) - there was no repudiation of Section 115 (7) - there was no adjustment in states of administration - respondents were youngsters to appealing party in framework of Assistants - appealing party did not profit himself of chance stood to him to qualify himself as Assistant Section Officer by passing recommended examination - appealing party can\'t be heard to whine that the individuals who were youngsters to him as Assistant have stolen walk over him - offer expelled.

She met with an accident on or about\n\n20.9.1999 while she was aged only 9 years. In the said accident she suffered\n\nthe following injuries, as stated in the application filed on her behalf before\n\nthe Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal :\n\n\n             1.     There is swelling deformity &amp; fracture of\n                    middle 3rd of Lt. thigh (femur shaft).\n             2.     Abrasion over left frontal region.\n \n\n             3.     Abrasion over Rt. Lateral aspect.\"\n\n\n3.    She was treated by two doctors. According to one of them, namely,\n\nDr. Mukund, who examined himself as PW3, she suffered 10% to 15% of\n\ndisability whereas according to the other doctor, Dr. Shivanand, she suffered\n\n20% to 25% of physical disability in her left lower limb.\n\n\n      An amount of Rs.3,00,000/- was claimed by her by way of\n\ncompensation in the claim petition before the Motor Accidents Claims\n\nTribunal under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereinafter\n\ncalled and referred to for the sake of brevity as `the Act&apos;). The Tribunal,\n\nhowever, having regard to the evidences brought on record, opining that\n\npermanent disability suffered by her would be 10%, a sum of Rs.40,000/-\n\nawarded on the said ground. The total amount of compensation determined\n\nwas a sum of Rs.72,785/- details of which are as under :\n\n\n                   \"Rs.18,000/- towards pain and sufferings\n             and agony, Rs. 12,460 towards diet and attendant\n             charges and Rs.323/- were awarded towards\n             medical expenses.\"\n\n\n4.    On an appeal preferred thereagainst, the High Court, without\n\nassigning any reason, enhanced the amount of compensation to\n\nRs.1,12,000/-, stating :\n \n\n            \"Petitioner could be awarded Rs.30,000/- for pain\n            and agony, Rs.10,000/- for medical and incidental\n            expenses relating to treatment, Rs.15,000/- for loss\n            of amenities and discomfort on account of\n            disability, Rs.27,000/- (1500 X 18) for loss of\n            future earnings on account of disability and\n            Rs.20,000/- for loss of marriage prospects on\n            account of disability.

On\n            the enhanced compensation, the interest payable\n            shall be 6% p.a. from the date of petition till\n            payment.\"\n\n\n5.    Appellant being aggrieved by and dissatisfied therewith is before us.\n\n\n6.    Mr. P.V.V. Shetty, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\nappellant, would contend that the High Court committed a serious error in\n\nawarding only a sum of Rs.1,12,000/- without taking into consideration her\n\nprospect of marriage. The amount of compensation on the basis of notional\n\nincome should not have been determined, urging that even if she was to\n\nwork as a labourer, she would have earned at Rs.4,000/- per month.\n\n\n7.    Indisputably, she was a child at that time. She had no earning. What\n\namount could be awarded towards future loss of earning or prospective loss\n\nof earning could not have been determined on the basis of any legal\n\nprinciple. Compensation for the injuries suffered by a person in a motor\n\nvehicle accident can be determined either on the basis of the actual damages\n\nsuffered or upon application of the structured formula. Although for the\n \n\npurpose of invoking the provisions of Section 163A of the Act, a legal\n\nprinciple may be found in the Second Schedule thereof.           The Second\n\nSchedule provides that where no income is proved, notional income for the\n\npurpose of payment of compensation to those who had no income prior to\n\naccident, a sum of Rs.15,000/- per annum would be considered as the\n\nmultiplicand. The multiplier which was required to be applied would be 15.\n\nParagraph 4 and 5 of the said Schedule reads as under :\n\n\n            \"4. General damages in case of injuries and\n            disabilities--\n            (i)    Pain and sufferings :\n                   (a) Grievous injuries\n                                                      Rs.5,000\n                   (b) Non-grievous injuries          Rs.1,000\n            (ii)   Medical expenses--actual expenses\n                   Incurred supported by bills/vouchers\n                   But not exceeding as onetime\n                   Payment                            Rs.15,000\n            5.

All the petitioners, in these three Writ Petitions filed under  Article\r\n    32 of the Constitution of India, are similarly situated. After  getting\r\n    the requisite training they have acquired the nomenclature of  \'trained\r\n    teachers\'. They  seek  an  appointments  in  the  schools  run  by  the\r\n    Respondent-State of Jharkhand as assistant teachers. Some IAs filed  by\r\n    several similarly situated teachers for  impleadment  and  seeking  the\r\n    same relief. It is for this reason that these petitions were conjointly\r\n    heard.\r\n 2. The exact prayer, contained in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 173  of  2010,\r\n    would give a glimpse of  the  nature  of  the  case  set  up  by  these\r\n    petitioners and the precise relief which these  petitioners  pray  for.\r\n    This prayer reads as under:\r\n               It is, therefore, respectfully prayed that Your  Lordships  may\r\n            graciously be pleased to:\r\n\r\n\r\n               i) Issue a writ, order or direction directing the respondents\r\n                  more particularly Respondent Nos. 1 to 3  to  appoint  the\r\n                  petitioners and similarly circumstanced  Trained  Teachers\r\n                  in order of seniority.\r\n\r\n\r\n              ii) Issue a writ, order or direction directing the respondents\r\n                  and more particularly the State of  Jharkhand  (Respondent\r\n                  Nos. 1 to 3)  to  protect  fundamental  right  of  Primary\r\n                  Education  to  the  children  of  State  of  Jharkhand  by\r\n                  appointing the Trained Teachers available in the Jharkhand\r\n                  State  on  the  sanctioned  vacant  posts   of   Assistant\r\n                  Teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n             iii) Pass such other or orders as this Honourable Court  may  deem\r\n                  fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of the  case\r\n                  and in the interests of justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  The background in which these petitions have come  to  be\r\n     filed is somewhat detailed one with chequered  history,  riddled  with\r\n     previous litigation  benefit  whereof  the  petitioners  are  seeking.\r\n     However, we would endeavour to traverse through  these  events  in  as\r\n     simple a manner as possible.\r\n     3.     As is well known, the State of Jharkhand  was  created  in  the\r\n     year 2000. Before that it was a part of the State of Bihar. All  these\r\n     petitioners belong to undivided Bihar vintage. They  claim  that  they\r\n     are  qualified   and   trained   teachers   who   acquired   requisite\r\n     qualification  and  underwent  necessary  training  and  thus   became\r\n     eligible to be considered for appointment as primary teachers  in  the\r\n     schools run by the State Government  as  per  the  provisions  of  the\r\n     Extant Rules on the subject. However, even  when  the  Government  was\r\n     legally bound to appoint only the trained teachers, on the basis of an\r\n     advertisement issued on 6.10.1991  by  the  Government  of  Bihar  for\r\n     filling up of 25,000 posts of Assistant Teachers, the State  recruited\r\n     17,281  untrained  teachers  out  of  total  appointments  of   19,272\r\n     Assistant  Teachers  made  in  the  said  recruitment  process.   This\r\n     selection was challenged by some persons by filing  writ  petition  in\r\n     the High Court of Judicature at Patna which was decided on  26.9.1996.\r\n     The High Court did not quash the appointments already made, though  at\r\n     the same time it held that the State  would  not  force  a  person  to\r\n     confine his application to a particular district. Against this  order,\r\n     Special Leave Petition No. 23187 of 1996  was  preferred  before  this\r\n     Court. In those proceedings an affidavit dated 14.8.1997 was filed  by\r\n     the Deputy Superintendent of Education, Bihar Government  agreeing  to\r\n     appoint trained teacher against existing vacancies. Having  regard  to\r\n     the averments made in the said affidavit, SLP  was  disposed  of  vide\r\n     order dated 5.9.1997. This case is known as Ram Vinay Kumar &amp; Ors.  v.\r\n     State of Bihar and  Ors.  (1998)  9  SCC  227.  The  exact  directions\r\n     regarding appointment to the post of  Assistant  Teachers  which  were\r\n     given by this Court are the following:\r\n              (i)  The Commission shall conduct a special selection  for  the\r\n           purpose of appointment of  these  unfilled  posts  from  amongst\r\n           applicants who had submitted their applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n           (ii)  The selection shall be confined to  applicants  possessing\r\n           teacher\'s  training/  qualification  obtained  from  government/\r\n           private teacher\'s training institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n           (iii) The selection shall be made by holding a preliminary  test\r\n           and a written examination of the candidates who qualify  in  the\r\n           preliminary test.\r\n\r\n\r\n       iv) In case the number of persons found suitable for appointment  in\r\n           such special selection exceeds the number  of  posts  for  which\r\n           recruitment was to be made on the basis of  advertisement  dated\r\n           6.10.1991, the surplus number of candidates who have been  found\r\n           suitable for the appointment would be justified against posts to\r\n           be filled on the basis of subsequent selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        v) The special selection which is to be conducted in  pursuance  of\r\n           these  directions  shall  be  completed  by  the  Commission  by\r\n           31.1.1997.   \r\n\r\n\r\n  4. In nut-shell, the direction was to conduct  a  special  selection  for\r\n     filling up of the unfilled posts from amongst the applicants  who  had\r\n     already submitted their applications  pursuant  to  the  advertisement\r\n     issued and it  was  to  be  confined  to  those  applicants  who  were\r\n     possessing teachers training/ qualification obtained from  Government/\r\n     private teachers\' training institution i.e. from amongst  the  trained\r\n     teachers. As per the petitioners as  on  30.9.1993  there  were  about\r\n     45,000 vacancies in as much as against total post of 2,09,981,  number\r\n     of teachers working were 1,54,751. Furthermore, in  next  three  years\r\n     about 18,431 teachers were expected to  retire.  Therefore,  projected\r\n     vacancies were approximately 63,000. On the creation of the  State  of\r\n     Jharkhand in terms of Bihar  Reorganisation  Act,  2000  proportionate\r\n     vacancies i.e. one-third came to the share of State of Jharkhand which\r\n     would mean that 21,000 vacancies were available on the date  on  which\r\n     this State was created.\r\n     5.     It is stated by the petitioners that for almost  7  years  from\r\n     the date of directions given in Ram Vinay Kumar\'s Case, no action  was\r\n     taken. It forced certain sections of trained teachers to approach  the\r\n     Patna High Court by way of several  Writ  Petitions.  All  these  Writ\r\n     Petitions were heard together with leading case known as Nand  Kishore\r\n     Ojha &amp; Ors. v. State of Bihar and Ors. (CWJC 13246/2003).  These  Writ\r\n     Petitions were allowed by the Patna High  Court  vide  judgment  dated\r\n     1.7.2004. In the said judgment it was inter alia noted that there were\r\n     number of unfilled vacancies because of  which  primary  schools  were\r\n     lying empty. The High Court deprecated the inaction on the part of the\r\n     Government of Bihar in not implementing the judgment of this Court  in\r\n     Ram Vinay Kumar\'s Case, on one pretext or the other, thereby  creating\r\n     a human rights problem in denying a  young  generation  its  right  to\r\n     basic education. According to the High Court, the solution was  simple\r\n     viz. to follow the judgment of this Court in Ram  Vinay  Kumar\'s  case\r\n     from where the circumstances has been left out. The  High  Court  also\r\n     calculated the number of existing  vacancies  in  the  manner  already\r\n     pointed out above.  On this basis direction was given to carry out the\r\n     selection process as per the mandate of this Court  contained  in  the\r\n     case of Ram Vinay Kumar.\r\n     6.     The State of Bihar challenged the aforesaid  judgment  of  High\r\n     Court by filing  Special  Leave  Petitions  in  this  Court.  However,\r\n     thereafter affidavit dated 18.1.2006 was filed by the Commissioner-cum-\r\n     Secretary, Education Department,  Government  of  Bihar  alongwith  an\r\n     application for withdrawal of those Special Leave  Petitions.  In  the\r\n     affidavit an undertaking was given that  only  trained  teachers  were\r\n     appointed as Assistant teachers in the State of Bihar.  Further  owing\r\n     to the reason that the number of available teachers in  the  State  of\r\n     Bihar were less than the available sanctioned post  and  no  test  for\r\n     selection was required. On the basis of this affidavit,  orders  dated\r\n     23.1.2006 were  passed  permitting  the  Government  to  withdraw  the\r\n     Special Leave Petitions.\r\n     7.     When the undertaking  given  in  the  said  affidavit  was  not\r\n     implemented  immediately  thereafter,  some  persons  filed   Contempt\r\n     Petition No. 207 of 2006 in this Court which was disposed of by orders\r\n     dated 19.3.2007 with a direction to the State of  Bihar  to  implement\r\n     its undertaking.\r\n            Operative part of the said order reads as under:\r\n              In paragraph 17 of the said affidavit in reply dated  7.2.2007,\r\n           it is stated that priority has been given to trained teachers in\r\n           appointment and only if trained teachers are  not  available  in\r\n           sufficient  numbers,  the  case  of   untrained   teachers   are\r\n           considered by the concerned  by  the  Panchayati  Raj  Institute\r\n           (PRI) to achieve the constitutional goal of free and  compulsory\r\n           education for children from age 6-14, and  in  this  regard  the\r\n           State of Bihar and other  answering  respondents  are  complying\r\n           with the orders of the High Court and  also  of  this  Court.  A\r\n           rejoinder has also been filed by the  petitioner  disputing  the\r\n           statements made by the State of Bihar  in  the  affidavit  dated\r\n           7.2.2007.\r\n                 In view of the categorical statement  now  made  that  the\r\n           priority will be given to the trained  teachers  in  appointment\r\n           and also the clarification made  in  paragraphs  19  to  222  of\r\n           aforesaid affidavit dated 7.2.2007, we direct the State of Bihar\r\n           to implement the undertaking given by the State of Bihar earlier\r\n           and also now by the present affidavit dated 7.2.2007  in  letter\r\n           and spirit by appointing the trained teachers on priority basis.\r\n                 The Contempt Petition is disposed of accordingly.   \r\n\r\n\r\n     8.     Still this undertaking was  not  complied  with  which  led  to\r\n     filing of another Contempt  Petition  No.  297  of  2007  titled  Nand\r\n     Kishore Ojha v. Anjani Kumar Singh  in which following interim  orders\r\n     dated 9.12.2009 were passed.\r\n              Accordingly, without issuing a Rule of Contempt, we direct that\r\n           the 34,540 vacancies shown as  available  in  the  advertisement\r\n           published in December, 2003,  be  filled  up  from  amongst  the\r\n           trained teachers who are available, in order  of  seniority.  As\r\n           indicated above, this is to be done on a one-time basis and must\r\n           not be taken as the regular practice to be followed.\r\n           Let the Contempt Petition be adjourned for a further  period  of\r\n           six weeks to enable the State Government to implement this order\r\n           and to submit a report on the next date as to the result of  the\r\n           discussions  held  between  the  petitioner  and  the  concerned\r\n           authorities.   \r\n\r\n\r\n     9.     Thereafter, the State of Bihar filled up  the  vacant  post  of\r\n     Assistant Teachers in terms of its undertaking thereby recruiting from\r\n     amongst the trained teachers who had applied earlier, pursuant to  the\r\n     advertisement given in the year 1991. Many had become over aged in the\r\n     meantime, and age relaxation was given in their cases.\r\n     10.    What is narrated above is the  history  of  litigation  in  the\r\n     State of  Bihar.  In  so  far  as  State  of  Jharkhand  is  concerned\r\n     (respondent herein),  as  already  pointed  out  above,  approximately\r\n     21,000 vacant post were transferred  to  this  State.  The  respondent\r\n     advertised these vacancies in the year 2002 by  giving  relaxation  in\r\n     age by 5 years only. Because of this reason many trained teachers,  in\r\n     which category of the petitioners include, could not be  appointed  as\r\n     Assistant Teachers, being overage. The petitioners, in this  backdrop,\r\n     contend that they are entitled to the benefit  of  Ram  Vinay  Kumar\'s\r\n     judgment of this Court  rendered  much  before  the  creation  of  the\r\n     Jharkhand State and applied to the erstwhile  unified  Bihar  and  the\r\n     judgment be implemented in their case as well as it has  happened  qua\r\n     the trained teachers in State of Bihar in the manner explained  above.\r\n     We may point out  at  this  stage  that  respondent  State  is  making\r\n     appointment only from amongst trained teachers. The problem,  however,\r\n     has arisen because fo the reason that these  petitioners  have  become\r\n     over aged and wanted total age relaxation. To put it, succinctly  they\r\n     are claiming parity with their counterparts in the State of Bihar  and\r\n     submitting that when those  teachers  were  appointed  by  giving  age\r\n     relaxation, there is no reason to deprive  the  petitioners  from  the\r\n     same treatment which would, otherwise, be discriminatory and violative\r\n     of Article 14 of the Constitution.\r\n     11.    The petitioners have pointed out that the respondent-State  had\r\n     set up a Committee in the year 2001 for implementation of the judgment\r\n     and even the said Committee in its report dated 31.5.2001  recommended\r\n     that all vacancies in the State of Jharkhand be  filled  with  trained\r\n     teachers  within  two  months.  The  operative  portion  of  the  said\r\n     recommendation reads as under:\r\n              Since the Government at its own  level  have  imparted  teacher\r\n           training to the thousands and the trained teachers were  in  the\r\n           hope for the two decades  that  they  will  be  appointed  as  a\r\n           teacher.  It  is  totally  unjustified  and  in-human  that  the\r\n           Government appoints untrained persons  and  thereby  ruined  the\r\n           future of trained teachers. Therefore,  the  committee  here  by\r\n           recommends that all the vacancies in the State of  Jharkhand  be\r\n           fulfill with trained teachers within  2  months.  If  number  of\r\n           trained teachers exceeds  the  number  of  vacancies,  then  the\r\n           vacancies be fulfilled on the basis of seniority of the  trained\r\n           teachers  i.e.  in  the  order  of   their   getting   training.\r\n           Thereafter,  the  trained  teachers   remained   unemployed   be\r\n           appointed  against  subsequent  vacancies.  In  the  appointment\r\n           process the  All the petitioners, in the Writ Petitions filed under&nbsp;Article 32&nbsp;of the Constitution of India, are similarly situated. After getting the requisite training they have acquired the nomenclature of \'trained teachers\'. They seek an appointments in the schools run by the Respondent-State of Jharkhand as assistant teachers. Some IAs filed by several similarly situated teachers for impleadment and seeking the same relief. It is for this reason that these petitions were conjointly heard.The direction was to conduct a special selection for filling up of the unfilled posts from amongst the applicants who had already submitted their applications pursuant to the advertisement issued and it was to be confined to those applicants who were possessing teachers training/ qualification obtained from Government/ private teachers\' training institution i.e. from amongst the trained teachers.&nbsp;The High Court deprecated the inaction on the part of the Government of Bihar in not implementing the judgment of this Court .The High Court also calculated the number of existing vacancies .The State of Bihar challenged the aforesaid judgment of High Court by filing Special Leave Petitions in this Court.Thereafter, the State of Bihar filled up the vacant post of Assistant Teachers in terms of its undertaking thereby recruiting from amongst the trained teachers who had applied earlier, pursuant to the advertisement given in the year 1991. Many had become over aged in the meantime, and age relaxation was given in their cases.Having regard to the above it would not be permissible to the petitioners to compare their case with their counterparts in Bihar. As far as the counterparts in the State of Bihar are concerned they had filed writ petitions well in time i.e. way back in the year 2003 in Patna High Court wherein those persons succeeded. The Patna High Court allowed those writ petitions vide judgment dated 1.7.2004 directing the State of Bihar to implement the judgment in Ram Vinay Kumar\'s Case. In such circumstances this Court would not be inclined to grant any relief to the petitioners in these petitions filed under&nbsp;Article 32&nbsp;of the Constitution, more so when it is found that the respondent/ State of Jharkhand has taken steps in conformity with the statutory recruitment rules framed under proviso to&nbsp;Article 309&nbsp;of the Constitution.Finding no merits in these writ petitions, same were dismissed. All pending I.As also stand dismissed. I.As Disposed','Punjab State Warehousing Corp Vs Bhushan Chander & Anr Dipak Misra, J.\r\n\r\n\r\n      The singular question that has emanated in  this  appeal,  by  special\r\nleave, is whether the High  Court  has  correctly  accepted  the  submission\r\nadvanced on behalf of the first respondent, who was convicted  for  offences\r\npunishable under Section 409/467/468/471 of  the  Indian  Penal  Code,  1860\r\n(for short,    IPC   ) and had been awarded sentence for each  of  the  offences\r\nwith the stipulation that they would run  concurrently,  that  he  being  an\r\nemployee of the appellant Corporation is a public servant and the trial  had\r\ncommenced without obtaining sanction  under  Section  197  of  the  Code  of\r\nCriminal Procedure, 1973  (CrPC)  and  hence,  the  trial  in  entirety  was\r\ninvalid and as a result the conviction  and  sentence  deserved  to  be  set\r\naside.\r\n2.    As far as the factual narration is  concerned,  suffice  it  to  state\r\nthat the Managing Director of  the  Corporation  had  written  a  letter  on\r\n28.6.1989 to the concerned police authority to register a case  against  the\r\nfirst respondent for offences punishable under Sections 409/467/468 and  471\r\nof  the  IPC  or  any  other   appropriate   provision   of   law.    During\r\ninvestigation, the investigating agency  found  that  the  accused  who  was\r\nworking as a Godown Assistant in  the  Corporation  had  misappropriated  11\r\ngunny bales value of which was Rs.38,841/-; that he had  tampered  with  the\r\nrecord of the department; and accordingly the police authorities  filed  the\r\ncharge-sheet for the  aforesaid  offences  before  the  court  of  competent\r\nJudicial Magistrate.  The  learned  Magistrate  on  the  basis  of  evidence\r\nbrought on record, found that the prosecution had been able  to  bring  home\r\nthe guilt against the  accused  and  accordingly  sentenced  him  to  suffer\r\nrigorous imprisonment for three years under Section 467 and 409 IPC and  two\r\nyears under Section 468/471 IPC with separate default clauses. The  judgment\r\nof conviction and order of  sentence  was  assailed  in  appeal  before  the\r\nlearned Session Judge, Firozpur and the matter  was  finally  heard  by  the\r\nlearned Additional Session Judge, who appreciating the evidence  on  record,\r\nconcurred with the conviction but  modified  the  sentence  of  three  years\r\nimposed under Section 409 and 467 IPC to two years.\r\n3.    Being dissatisfied, the first respondent preferred  Criminal  Revision\r\nNo. 359/2001 in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh.   Before\r\nthe revisional court, the only contention that was raised pertained to  non-\r\nobtaining of sanction under Section 197 CrPC.   It  was  argued  before  the\r\nlearned Single Judge that in view of the decisions in State  of  Maharashtra\r\nv. Dr. Budhikota Subbarao[1], Rakesh Kumar Mishra  v.  State  of  Bihar  and\r\nothers[2], Sankaran Moitra v. Sadhna Das and another[3],  Om  Kumar  Dhankar\r\nv. State of Haryana[4], the requisite sanction  having  not  been  obtained,\r\nthe trial was vitiated.  On behalf of the Corporation as well as  the  State\r\nof Punjab, it was argued that the sanction under Section 197  CrPC  was  not\r\nnecessary to prosecute the first respondent and  to  substantiate  the  said\r\nstand, reliance was  placed  on  Dr.  Lakshmansingh  Himatsingh  Vaghela  v.\r\nNaresh Kumar Chadrrashanker Jah[5], N. Bhargavan Pillai (dead) by  Lrs.  and\r\nanother v. State of Kerala[6],   State  of  U.P.  v.  Paras  Nath  Singh[7],\r\nRaghunath Anant Govilkar v. State of Maharashtra[8]  and  Choudhury  Parveen\r\nSultana v. State of West Bengal[9].\r\n4.    The learned Single Judge referred to the charges framed under  Section\r\n409 and 467 IPC.  He also referred  to  the  authorities  in  Prakash  Singh\r\nBadal v. State of Punjab[10], Nirmal Singh Kahlon v.  State  of  Punjab[11],\r\nOm Kumar Dhankar (supra) and Bakshish Singh  Brar  v.  Gurmel  Kaur[12]  and\r\nanalyzing Section 197 CrPC observed that the  said  provision  is  meant  to\r\nprotect responsible public servants against  the  institution  of  vexatious\r\ncriminal proceedings for offences alleged to have been  committed  by  them.\r\nThe learned Single Judge referred to P. Arulswami v.  State  of  Madras[13],\r\nMatajog Dube v.  H.C.  Bahri[14],  P.K.  Pradhan  v.  State  of  Sikkim[15],\r\nreproduced a passage from B. Saha v. M.S. Kochar[16], and came  to  hold  as\r\nfollows:-\r\n   So far as the commission of offence in this case  is  concerned,  the  very\r\nallegation would clearly reveal that it is not a case where the  allegations\r\nare in any other capacity than a public  servant.   The  allegation  against\r\nthe petitioner is that while being a public  servant,  he  had  committed  a\r\ncriminal breach of trust.  It is only in the  performance  of  the  official\r\nduty that the  petitioner  is  alleged  to  have  been  found  with  certain\r\ndeficiencies for which allegation of criminal breach of trust  as  well  has\r\nbeen made against him.  Certainly the facts in this  case  are  inextricably\r\nmingled with the official duty of the petitioner to be considered  severable\r\nto call for dispensing with the requirement of sanction   .\r\n\r\n5.    After so stating, the revisional court distinguished the  decision  in\r\nParas Nath Singh (supra)  which  was  relied  upon  by  the  prosecution  by\r\nstating thus:-\r\n   The aggrieved  person  in  the  said  case  has  faced  trial  for  alleged\r\ncommission of the offences punishable under Section 409, 420,  461  and  468\r\nIPC.  The Supreme Court in  this  case  has  drawn  difference  between  the\r\nofficial duty and doing something by public servant in  the  course  of  his\r\nservice.  It is observed that the section does  not  extend  its  protective\r\ncover to act or omission done by a public servant in service, but  restricts\r\nits scope of operation to only those acts or omissions, which are done by  a\r\npublic servant in discharge of official duty.  Even this observation of  the\r\nHon   ble Supreme Court would fully apply to the facts of  the  present  case.\r\nHere, the petitioner is alleged to have committed this offence not  only  as\r\na public servant but is stated to have done so in discharge of his  official\r\nduty.   In discharge of his official duty, the petitioner  was  required  to\r\nprotect stock, which he failed to do so and so he is asked  to  account  for\r\nthe same   .\r\n\r\n6.    The eventual conclusion recorded by the learned  Single  Judge  is  to\r\nthe following effect:-\r\n   Under normal circumstances, the offence under Sections 467/468/471 IPC  may\r\nbe of such a nature that requirement of  obtaining  sanction  under  Section\r\n197 CrPC may not be called for.  The offences in this case have been  inter-\r\nconnected with  the  main  offence  alleged  against  the  petitioner  under\r\nSection 409 IPC and it would clearly indicate that these offences could  not\r\nbe separately treated or dealt  with.   Requirement  of  obtaining  sanction\r\nwould be needed for an offence under Section 409 IPC and the  same  may  not\r\nbe separated from the remaining offences   .\r\n\r\n7.    After so stating, the learned Single Judge ruled that the  Corporation\r\nis a fully government-owned  and  financed  by  the  State  Government  and,\r\ntherefore, he is a public servant as per the definition  of  Section  21  of\r\nIPC and, therefore, his employment in the Corporation would confer  him  the\r\nstatus of public servant for which sanction is  necessary.   The  revisional\r\ncourt has not adverted to any of the aspects touching  merits  of  the  case\r\nand, therefore, we refrain from entering into the said arena.\r\n8.    Section 197(1) and  (2)  CrPC  which  are  relevant  for  the  present\r\npurpose are reproduced below:-\r\n   197. Prosecution of Judges and public servants.   (1) When any person who  is\r\nor was a Judge or Magistrate or a public  servant  not  removable  from  his\r\noffice save by or with the sanction of the  Government  is  accused  of  any\r\noffence alleged to have been committed by him while acting or purporting  to\r\nact in the discharge of his official duty, no court  shall  take  cognizance\r\nof such  offence  except  with  the  previous  sanction  save  as  otherwise\r\nprovided in the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013   \r\n\r\n(a) in the case of a person who is employed or, as the case may be,  was  at\r\nthe time of commission of the alleged offence employed, in  connection  with\r\nthe affairs of the Union, of the Central Government;\r\n\r\n(b) in the case of a person who is employed or, as the case may be,  was  at\r\nthe time of commission of the alleged offence employed, in  connection  with\r\nthe affairs of a State, of the State Government:\r\n\r\nProvided that where the alleged offence was committed by a  person  referred\r\nto in clause (b) during the period while a proclamation issued under  clause\r\n(1) of Article 356 of the Constitution was in force in a State,  clause  (b)\r\nwill apply as if for the expression    State  Government     occurring  therein,\r\nthe expression    Central Government    were substituted.\r\n\r\nExplanation.   For the removal  of  doubts  it  is  hereby  declared  that  no\r\nsanction shall be required in case  of  a  public  servant  accused  of  any\r\noffence alleged to have been committed under Section 166-A,  Section  166-B,\r\nSection 354, Section 354-A, Section 354-B,  Section  354-C,  Section  354-D,\r\nSection 370,  Section  375,  Section  376,  Section  376-A,  Section  376-C,\r\nSection 376-D or Section 509 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860).\r\n\r\n(2)   No Court shall take cognizance of any offence  alleged  to  have  been\r\ncommitted by any member of the Armed Forces of the  Union  while  acting  or\r\npurporting to act in the discharge of his official  duty,  except  with  the\r\nprevious sanction of the Central Government.   \r\n\r\n9.    In Matajog Dube (supra), certain complaints were alleged  against  the\r\nauthorized  officials  on  the  ground  that  the  officials  had  committed\r\noffences  punishable  under  Sections  323,  341,  342  and  109  IPC.   The\r\nofficials were arrayed as accused persons who were authorized to search  two\r\npremises in question.  The trial Magistrate discharged the  accused  persons\r\nfor want of sanction under Section 197 CrPC.  Similar order  was  passed  by\r\nanother trial Magistrate.  Both the orders were concurred with by  the  High\r\nCourt.  Be it noted two cases had arisen as two complaints were  filed.   It\r\nwas contended before  this  Court  that  the  act  of  criminal  assault  or\r\nwrongful confinement can never be regarded  as  act  done  while  acting  or\r\npurporting to act in the  discharge  of  official  duty  and  that  duty  is\r\nclearly defined in the statute.  The  Constitution  Bench  referred  to  two\r\ndecisions  of  the  Federal  Court  and  the  decisions  of  this  Court  in\r\nShreekantiah Ramayya Munipalli v. State of Bombay[17]  and  Amrik  Singh  v.\r\nState of Pepsu[18] and analyzing the earlier authorities opined that:-\r\n   The result of foregoing discussion is this:  There  must  be  a  reasonable\r\nconnection between the act and the discharge of official duty; the act  must\r\nbear such relation to the duty that the accused could lay a  reasonable  but\r\nnot a pretended or fanciful claim, that he did  it  in  the  course  of  the\r\nperformance of his duty   .\r\n\r\n10.   Thereafter, the  Court  adverted  to  the  determination  of  need  of\r\nsanction and the relevant  stage.   We  are  not  concerned  with  the  said\r\naspects in the present case.\r\n11.    In  Arulswami  (supra),  the  President  of  a  Panchayat  Board  was\r\nconvicted under Section 409 IPC by the High Court which had  overturned  the\r\ndecision of the lower court.  It was argued before the High Court  that  the\r\nprosecution  was  not  maintainable  for  want  of  sanction  by  the  State\r\nGovernment under Section 106 of the Madras Village Panchayats  Act   (Madras\r\nAct X of 1950).  The High Court held that no sanction of the Government  was\r\nnecessary as the appellant had ceased to hold the office of  the  President,\r\nwhen the prosecution was launched and  further  that  the  sanction  of  the\r\nCollector was sufficient in law.  That apart, this Court posed the  question\r\nwhether the sanction of the Government under Section 106 of the  Madras  Act\r\nwas necessary for the prosecution of the appellant  for  the  offence  under\r\nSection 409 IPC.  To appreciate the contention raised,  the  Court  referred\r\nto Section 197 CrPC.  The three-Judge Bench referred  to  the  decisions  in\r\nHori Ram Singh v. Emperor[19] and H.H.B. Gill v. The King[20].   The  three-\r\nJudge Bench quoted the observations of Lord  Simonds  made  in  H.H.B.  Gill\r\n(supra) in approving the statement of law made in Hori Ram  Singh   (supra).\r\nThe Court also took note of the  fact  that  the  decision  in  H.H.B.  Gill\r\n(supra) had been approved in Albert West Meads v.  The  King[21],  Phanindra\r\nChandra v. The King[22] and R. W. Mathams v. State of  West  Bengal[23]  and\r\neventually held:-\r\n   It is not therefore every  offence  committed  by  a  public  servant  that\r\nrequires sanction for prosecution under S. 197(1) of the Criminal  Procedure\r\nCode; nor even every act done by him while he is  actually  engaged  in  the\r\nperformance of his  official  duties;  but  if  the  act  complained  of  is\r\ndirectly concerned with his official  duties  so  that,  if  questioned,  it\r\ncould be claimed to have been done by virtue of the  office,  then  sanction\r\nwould be necessary.  It is the quality of the act that is important  and  if\r\nit falls within the scope and range of his official  duties  the  protection\r\ncontemplated by S. 197 of the Criminal Procedure  Code  will  be  attracted.\r\nAn office may be entirely unconnected with the official duty as such  or  it\r\nmay be committed within the  scope  of  the  official  duty.   Where  it  is\r\nunconnected with the official duty there can be no protection   .\r\n12.   The Court while arriving at the said conclusion also  placed  reliance\r\non Om Prakash Gupta v. State of U.P.[24] and ultimately came  to  hold  that\r\nthe sanction of the Government is  not  necessary  for  prosecution  of  the\r\naccused under Section 409 IPC.\r\n13.   The aforesaid two authorities  make  it  clear  that  no  sanction  is\r\nneeded to launch the prosecution for the offence  punishable  under  Section\r\n409 IPC.  As we notice from the impugned judgment, the learned Single  Judge\r\nhas been swayed away by what has been stated in B.  Saha  (supra).   In  the\r\nsaid  case,  the  appellants  had  sought  discharge  on  the  ground   that\r\ncognizance of the complaint had been taken without obtaining sanction  under\r\nSection 197 CrPC and Section 155 of the Customs Act, 1962.   The  Magistrate\r\nhad accepted the objection relying on the decision in  Shreekantiah  Ramayya\r\nMunipalli (supra).  The said order was challenged by the complainant  before\r\nthe High Court and the learned  Single  Judge,  after  elaborate  discussion\r\nopined that no sanction was required for the  prosecution  of  the  accused-\r\nappellants for the offence under Sections 120-B/409 IPC  because  they  were\r\ncertainly not acting in the discharge of their official  duties,  when  they\r\nmisappropriated the goods.  The three-Judge Bench analyzing  the  ambit  and\r\nscope of Section 197 CrPC opined that the  words     any  offence  alleged  to\r\nhave been committed by  him  while  acting  or  purporting  to  act  in  the\r\ndischarge of his official duty    employed in Section 197(1) of the Code,  are\r\ncapable of a narrow as well as a wide interpretation.   If  the  said  words\r\nare  construed  too  narrowly,  the  section  will  be  rendered  altogether\r\nsterile, for,    it is no part of an official duty to commit an  offence,  and\r\nnever can be   . The Court proceeded to observe that in the wider  sense,  the\r\nsaid words  will  take  under  their  umbrella  every  act  constituting  an\r\noffence, committed in the course  of  the  same  transaction  in  which  the\r\nofficial duty is performed  or  purports  to  be  performed  and  the  right\r\napproach to the import of these  words  lies  between  these  two  extremes.\r\nWhile on the one hand, it  is  not  every  offence  committed  by  a  public\r\nservant while engaged in the performance of  his  official  duty,  which  is\r\nentitled to the  protection  of  Section  197(1),  an  act  constituting  an\r\noffence, directly and reasonably  connected  with  his  official  duty  will\r\nrequire sanction for  prosecution  under  the  said  provision.   The  Court\r\nreferred to the observations of Ramaswami,  J.,  in  Baijnath  v.  State  of\r\nM.P.[25], which is to the following effect:-\r\n   it is the quality of the act that is important, and if it falls within  the\r\nscope and range of his  official  duties,  the  protection  contemplated  by\r\nSection 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code will be attracted   .\r\n\r\n      After  The Managing Director of the Corporation had written a letter on 28.6.1989 to the concerned police authority to register a case against the first respondent for offences punishable under&nbsp;Sections 409/467/468&nbsp;and&nbsp;471&nbsp;of the IPC or any other appropriate provision of law. During investigation, the investigating agency found that the accused who was working as a Godown Assistant in the Corporation had misappropriated 11 gunny bales value of which was Rs.38,841/-; that he had tampered with the record of the department; and accordingly the police authorities filed the charge-sheet for the aforesaid offences before the court of competent Judicial Magistrate. The learned Magistrate on the basis of evidence brought on record, found that the prosecution had been able to bring home the guilt against the accused and accordingly sentenced him to suffer rigorous imprisonment for three years under&nbsp;Section 467&nbsp;and&nbsp;409&nbsp;IPC and two years under&nbsp;Section 468/471&nbsp;IPC with separate default clauses. The judgment of conviction and order of sentence was assailed in appeal before the learned Session Judge, Firozpur and the matter was finally heard by the learned Additional Session Judge, who appreciating the evidence on record, concurred with the conviction but modified the sentence of three years imposed under&nbsp;Section 409&nbsp;and&nbsp;467&nbsp;IPC to two years.Being dissatisfied, the first respondent preferred Criminal Revision No. 359/2001 in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh. Before the revisional court, the only contention that was raised pertained to non- obtaining of sanction under&nbsp;Section 197&nbsp;CrPC.The Supreme Court in the case had drawn difference between the official duty and doing something by public servant in the course of his service.&nbsp;Here, the petitioner was alleged to have committed the offence not only as a public servant but was stated to have done so in discharge of his official duty. In discharge of his official duty, the petitioner was required to protect stock, which he failed to do so and so he was asked to account for the sameâ€.In view of the aforesaid analysis, the irresistible conclusion was that the respondents were not entitled to have the protective umbrella of&nbsp;Section 197&nbsp;CrPC and, therefore, the High Court has erred in setting aside the conviction and sentence on the ground that the trial is vitiated in the absence of sanction. Consequently, Supreme Court allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment and order passed by the High Court and remit the matter to the High Court to decide the revision petition in accordance with law.

In this batch of cases the question which arises for\r\n\r\ndetermination       is:   whether    BSE    Membership           Card   can   be\r\n\r\nconsidered     an    intangible         asset   for        the    purpose      of\r\n\r\ndepreciation    under      Section      32(1)(ii)     of    the    Income     Tax\r\n\r\nAct, 1961 (for short \"the 1961 Act\")?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFacts in M/s Techno Shares &amp; Stocks Ltd. [Lead matter]\r\n\r\n3.    In this case, we are concerned with the Assessment\r\n\r\nYears 1999-2000, 2000-2001, 2001-2002 and 2002-2003. The\r\n\r\nassessee   company        filed   its    Return     of     income       for   the\r\n \r\n\r\nAssessment      Year    1999-2000         disclosing     a    loss      of    Rs.\r\n\r\n10,77,276/-. The return was processed under Section 143(1)\r\n\r\non November 8, 2000. The case stood reopened under Section\r\n\r\n147 and Notice u/s 148 stood issued to the assessee on\r\n\r\n16.7.2002. The assessee filed its return of income under\r\n\r\nprotest. The assessee filed its return of income pursuant\r\n\r\nto the Notice u/s 148 once again declaring loss of Rs.\r\n\r\n10,77,276/-, the same as was in the original return of\r\n\r\nincome. The main reason for reopening of assessment under\r\n\r\nSection 147 was the claim of depreciation by the assessee\r\n\r\non BSE membership card amounting to Rs. 23,65,000/-. The\r\n\r\nclaim of depreciation of the assessee was based on Section\r\n\r\n32(1)(ii) which stood inserted by Finance (No. 2) Act,\r\n\r\n1998 w.e.f. 1.4.1999. However, the said Section deals with\r\n\r\nclaim    for   depreciation          of   items   acquired    on       or    after\r\n\r\n1.4.1998.      The assessee claimed before the A.O. that the\r\n\r\nBSE     membership     card    is     a    \"licence\"     or   \"business         or\r\n\r\ncommercial right of similar nature\" u/s 32(1)(ii) and is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, an intangible asset eligible for depreciation\r\n\r\nu/s 32(1)(ii) which submission was not accepted by the\r\n\r\nA.O.      It   was   held     that    membership    is   only      a   personal\r\n\r\npermission which is non-transferable and which does not\r\n\r\ndevolve automatically on legal heirs and, therefore, it is\r\n \r\n\r\nnot a privately owned asset.               That, there is no ownership\r\n\r\nof an asset and that what ultimately can be sold is only a\r\n\r\nRight to Nomination.           Further, according to the A.O., in\r\n\r\nthe case of BSE membership, there is no obsolescence, wear\r\n\r\nand tear or diminution in value by its use, hence, the\r\n\r\nassessee     was   not     entitled        to    claim     depreciation            u/s\r\n\r\n32(1)(ii).     This decision of the A.O. stood affirmed by\r\n\r\nC.I.T. (A) in the appeal filed by the assessee.\r\n\r\n4.    Aggrieved      by    the      said    decision       of    CIT    (A),       the\r\n\r\nassessee   carried       the   matter      in    appeal    to    the        Tribunal\r\n\r\nwhich took the view that since the assessee had acquired a\r\n\r\nright to trade on the floor of BSE through the membership\r\n\r\ncard, it was not entitled to depreciation u/s 32(1)(ii) of\r\n\r\nthe 1961 Act.        That, the said Card is a capital asset\r\n\r\nthrough    which   right       to   trade       on   the   floor       of    BSE    is\r\n\r\nacquired     and   since       it   is     intangible       asset       the     said\r\n\r\nassessee was entitled to depreciation u/s 32(1)(ii).\r\n\r\n5.    Against the said decision, the Department carried\r\n\r\nthe matter in appeal to the High Court which came to the\r\n\r\nconclusion,    following        certain     decisions       of     this       Court,\r\n\r\nthat the BSE membership card is only a personal privilege\r\n\r\ngranted to a member to trade in shares on the floor of the\r\n\r\nStock Exchange; that, such a privilege cannot be equated\r\n \r\n\r\nwith the expression \"licence\" or \"any other business or\r\n\r\ncommercial rights of similar nature\" u/s 32(1)(ii); that,\r\n\r\nthere     is    a   difference       between    acquiring       a    know-how,\r\n\r\npatent, copyright or trademark and acquiring a licence to\r\n\r\nuse     such     know-how,     patent,     copyright,       trademark         or\r\n\r\nfranchise;       that   the   expression       \"business    or      commercial\r\n\r\nrights of similar nature\" in Section 32(1)(ii) of the 1961\r\n\r\nAct   would      take   its    colour    from    the    preceding         words,\r\n\r\nnamely,        know-how,      patent,    copyright,        trademark         and\r\n\r\nfranchise which belong to a class of intellectual property\r\n\r\nrights and applying the rule of ejusdem generis, the High\r\n\r\nCourt held that the expression \"licence\" as well as the\r\n\r\nexpression       \"business     and    commercial       rights       of   similar\r\n\r\nnature\" in Section 32(1)(ii) of the 1961 Act are referable\r\n\r\nto IPRs such as know-how, patent, copyright, trademark and\r\n\r\nfranchise and since the BSE membership card does not fall\r\n\r\nin any of the above categories, the claim for depreciation\r\n\r\nwas not admissible on the BSE membership card acquired by\r\n\r\nthe   assessee      u/s    32(1)(ii).     Consequently,         the      appeals\r\n\r\nfiled by the Department stood allowed, hence, these civil\r\n\r\nappeals.\r\n\r\nImportance of BSE:\r\n\r\n6.       BSE is recognized by the Government of India under\r\n \r\n\r\nSecurities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956. Approximately\r\n\r\n70000 deals are executed on a daily basis. There are about\r\n\r\n3500     companies    which     are    listed    on   BSE.     The     market\r\n\r\ncapitalization of the BSE is Rs. 5 trillion. The main aim\r\n\r\nand object of the BSE is to provide a market place for the\r\n\r\npurchase    and   sale     of   securities.      It   aims     to    promote,\r\n\r\ndevelop and maintain a well regulated market for dealing\r\n\r\nin   securities      and   to   safeguard       the   interests       of    the\r\n\r\nmembers and the investing public having dealings in the\r\n\r\nExchange. It helps industrial development of the country\r\n\r\nthrough resources mobilization. It is set up to establish\r\n\r\nand promote \"just practices\" in securities transactions.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1996, the BSE constituted a Trade Guarantee\r\n\r\nScheme    under    which    all    trades    carried     out    on     online\r\n\r\ntrading    are    guaranteed      by   the   clearing    house       of    BSE.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, a depository has been set up as a joint venture\r\n\r\nbetween BSE and Bank of India etc. BSE has introduced\r\n\r\ntrading also in fixed income securities to give impetus to\r\n\r\ntrading in debentures and corporate debt instruments to\r\n\r\nincrease trading in Government owned securities.\r\n\r\nQuestion arising in the Present Matters:\r\n\r\n7.     Is depreciation allowable on the cost of a Stock\r\n\r\n       Exchange Membership Card under Section 32(1)(ii)\r\n \r\n\r\n     of the Income Tax Act, 1961, which was enacted and\r\n\r\n     inserted by Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnswer to the above Question:\r\n\r\n8.     To   answer   the    above    question,   we   need   to   quote\r\n\r\nhereinbelow certain relevant provisions of the 1961 Act:\r\n\r\n     2. In this      Act,   unless    the   context    otherwise\r\n     requires,--\r\n\r\n     (14)\"capital asset\" means property of any kind\r\n     held by an assessee, whether or not connected with\r\n     his business or profession, but does not include--\r\n\r\n            (i)      any   stock-in-trade,   consumable\r\n        stores   or   raw   materials  held   for   the\r\n        purposes of his business or profession ;\r\n\r\n                (ii) personal effects, that is to say,\r\n        movable property (including wearing apparel and\r\n        furniture, but excluding jewellery) held for\r\n        personal use by the assessee or any member of\r\n        his family dependent on him.\r\n\r\n     Depreciation.\r\n\r\n     32.

We also quote hereinbelow relevant Rules of Bombay\r\n\r\nStock Exchange Limited as they stood at the relevant time:\r\n\r\n                \"Membership a Personal Privilege\r\n\r\n         5.

Since the appellants\' land was also included in the notification, they \r\n\r\n\r\nmade a representation to the Chairman-cum-Chief Executive Officer of the \r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment   Authority   (Respondent   No.4)   with   copies   to   the   Chief \r\n\r\n\r\nMinister,   Principal   Secretary,   Housing   and   Urban   Development,   U.P.,   the \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDistrict   Magistrate   and   the   Special   Officer,   Land   Acquisition,   Gautam \r\n\r\n\r\nBuddh Nagar with the request that their land comprised   in Khasra No.394 \r\n\r\n\r\nmay not be acquired because they had raised construction 30-35 years ago \r\n\r\n\r\nand   were   using   the   property   for   abadi/habitation.   The   concerned \r\n\r\n\r\nfunctionaries/authorities did not pay heed to the request of the appellants and \r\n\r\n\r\nthe State Government issued notification dated 19.11.2008 under Section 6 \r\n\r\n\r\nread with Section 9 of the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.     The   appellants   challenged   the   acquisition   of   their   land   on   several \r\n\r\n\r\ngrounds including the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n       (i)      That the land cannot be used for industrial purposes because in \r\n\r\n\r\n       the draft Master Plan of Greater NOIDA (2021), the same is shown as \r\n\r\n\r\n       part of residential zone.  \r\n\r\n\r\n       (ii)     That they had already constructed dwelling  houses and as per \r\n\r\n\r\n       the   policy   of   the   State   Government,   the   residential   structures   are \r\n\r\n\r\n       exempted from acquisition.\r\n\r\n\r\n       (iii)    That   the   State   Government   arbitrarily   invoked   Section   17(1) \r\n\r\n\r\n       read with Section 17(4) of the Act and deprived them of their valuable \r\n\r\n\r\n       right to raise objections  under Section 5-A.\r\n\r\n\r\n       (iv)  The acquisition of land is vitiated by arbitrariness, mala fides and \r\n\r\n\r\n       violation  of  Article  14  of  the  Constitution   inasmuch  as   lands   of the \r\n\r\n\r\n       Member of Legislative  Assembly  and other influential persons were \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      left out from acquisition  despite the fact that they were not in abadi, \r\n\r\n\r\n      but   they   were   not   given   similar   treatment   despite   the   fact   that   their \r\n\r\n\r\n      land was part of abadi and they had constructed dwelling units.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6.    In support of their challenge to the invoking of Section 17(1) and (4), \r\n\r\n\r\nthe appellants made detailed averments in paragraphs 11 and 16 and raised \r\n\r\n\r\nspecific grounds A and F, which are extracted below:\r\n\r\n\r\n              \"11.   That   as   per   the   scheme   of   the   said   Act,   each   and \r\n\r\n              every  section  from sections  4  to 17  has  an independent \r\n\r\n              role   to   play   though   there   is   an   element   of   interaction \r\n\r\n              between them.  Section 5-A, has a very important role to \r\n\r\n              play in the acquisition proceedings and it is mandatory of \r\n\r\n              the part of the government to give hearing to the person \r\n\r\n              interested   in   the   land   whose   land   is   sought   to   be \r\n\r\n              acquired.    It is relevant  to point out that the acquisition \r\n\r\n              proceedings under the Act, are based on the principal of \r\n\r\n              eminent   domain   and   the   only   protection   given   to   the \r\n\r\n              person   whose   land   is   sought   to   be   acquired   is   an \r\n\r\n              opportunity under Section 5-A of the Act to convince the \r\n\r\n              enquiring authority that the purpose for which the land is \r\n\r\n              sought   to   be  acquired   is   in  fact   is   not   a  public   purpose \r\n\r\n              and is only purported to be one in the guise of a public \r\n\r\n              purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      It   is   relevant   to   mention   here   that   excluding   the \r\n\r\n              enquiry   under   Section   5-A   can   only   be   an   exception \r\n\r\n              where the urgency cannot brook any delay.  The enquiry \r\n\r\n              provides an opportunity to the owner of land to convince \r\n\r\n              the authorities concerned that the land in question is not \r\n\r\n              suitable for purpose for which it is sought to be acquired \r\n\r\n              or   the   same   sought   to   be   acquired   for   the   collateral \r\n\r\n              purposes.    It   is   pertinent   to   mention   here   that   the \r\n\r\n              respondents  No.  1  &amp;  2  without   the  application  of  mind \r\n\r\n              dispensed   with   the   enquiry   on   the   ground   of   urgency \r\n\r\n              invoking the power conferred by Section 17 (1) or (2) of \r\n\r\n              the   Act.     Further,   the   respondent   No.   1   &amp;   2   without \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplication of mind did not considered the survey report \r\n\r\nof the abadi of the village Makaura where the entire land \r\n\r\nis being used for the purpose of residence and grazing of \r\n\r\ncattle\'s in Khasra No. 394.  Further, the petitioners were \r\n\r\nsurprised to find that their land have not been included in \r\n\r\nthe   Abadi   irrespective   the   same   is   in   use   for   habitable \r\n\r\nand   keeping   the   cattle   and   other   uses.     The   petitioners \r\n\r\nhave   constructed   their   houses   and   using   the   same   for \r\n\r\ntheir   residence   and   keep   their   cattle\'s   and   agricultural \r\n\r\nproduce.    The   survey   report   clearly   shows   that   the \r\n\r\nimpugned Khasra  No. 394 is in use  for residence.    The \r\n\r\nreport in respect of the land in question falling in Khasra \r\n\r\nNo.   394   given   by   the   respondent   No.   4   vide \r\n\r\ncommunication   dated   26th  March,   2007   is   annexed   as \r\n\r\nAnnexure 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n16.     That   the   said   notification   under   Section   4   of   the \r\n\r\nAct   issued   by   the   respondent   No.   1   and   2   is   without \r\n\r\napplication   of   mind   and   there   was   no   urgency   in   the \r\n\r\nacquisition   of   land,   for   the   planned   industrial \r\n\r\ndevelopment, as the land, as per the master plan - 2021 \r\n\r\nthe   land   of   the   village   Makaura   is   reserved   for \r\n\r\n\"residential\"   of   which   the   respondent   No.   2   invoked \r\n\r\nSection 17 (1) and subsection 4 of the Act by dispensing \r\n\r\nwith an enquiry under Section 5A of the Act.   The said \r\n\r\naction   on   the   part   of   the   respondents   are   un-warranted \r\n\r\nand is in gross violation of Article 14,19, 21 and 300A of \r\n\r\nthe constitution.   The such illegal  act on the part of the \r\n\r\nrespondents show mala fide and their oblique motive to \r\n\r\ndeprive   the   owners   from  their   houses   in   order   to   fulfill \r\n\r\ntheir political obligations/promise to the private builders \r\n\r\nby   taking   the   shelter   of   section   17   of   the   Act   by \r\n\r\ndispensing with the enquiry under Section 5-A of the Act \r\n\r\nas well as overlooked purpose as stipulated in the Master \r\n\r\nPlan   2021   which   is   any   way   do   not   require   any   urgent \r\n\r\nattention. \r\n\r\n\r\nA.      That the whole acquisition proceedings   are void, \r\n\r\nunconstitutional,   tainted   with   mala   fide,   abuse   of \r\n\r\nauthority   and   power,   non-application   of   mind,   and   as \r\n\r\nsuch, liable to be quashed as violative of Articles 14,19 \r\n\r\nand 300-A of the Constitution of India. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            F.      That   the   purpose   stated   in   the   notification   under \r\n\r\n            Section   4   and   declaration   under   section   6   by   invoking \r\n\r\n            section   17   is   presently   non-existent   and   thus   the \r\n\r\n            notification   is   bad   in   law.   There   is   no   urgency   for   the \r\n\r\n            invocation   when   the   land   is   to   be   acquired   for   planned \r\n\r\n            development for the purpose of setting residential colony. \r\n\r\n            The impugned             notification   is   without   any   authority \r\n\r\n            of law and volatile of Article 300-A of the Constitution \r\n\r\n            of   India,   which   limits   the   power   to   acquire   land   to   the \r\n\r\n            authority under the Land Acquisition Act.  Therefore, the \r\n\r\n            notification in question is bad in law.\"\r\n\r\n                                                              (emphasis supplied)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7.    The  High  Court negatived  the  appellants\'   challenge  at the  threshold \r\n\r\n\r\nmainly on the ground that the averments contained in the petition were not \r\n\r\n\r\nsupported by a proper affidavit.  This is evident from the following portions \r\n\r\n\r\nof the impugned order:\r\n\r\n\r\n            \"Here the petitioners neither have pleaded that there exist \r\n\r\n            no material before  the State Government to come to the \r\n\r\n            conclusion that the enquiry under Section 5-A should be \r\n\r\n            dispensed with by invoking Section 17(4) of the Act nor \r\n\r\n            the learned counsel for the petitioners could place before \r\n\r\n            us   any   such   averment   in   the   writ   petition.   Though,   in \r\n\r\n            para-11 of the writ petition, an averment has been made \r\n\r\n            that the respondents no. 1 and 2 without the application \r\n\r\n            of   mind   dispensed   with   the   enquiry   on   the   ground   of \r\n\r\n            urgency  invoking the power conferred by Section  17(1) \r\n\r\n            or (2) of the Act, but in the affidavit, the said paragraph \r\n\r\n            has   been   sworn   on   the   basis   of   perusal   of   record. \r\n\r\n            Similarly   in   para   16   of   the   writ   petition,   the   only \r\n\r\n            averment contained therein is as under:\r\n\r\n\r\n            \"16. That the said notification under Section 4 of the \r\n\r\n            Act   issued   by   the   respondent   No.1   and   2   is   without \r\n\r\n            application of mind and there was no urgency in the \r\n\r\n            acquisition   of   land,   for   the   planned   industrial \r\n\r\n            development, as the land, as per the master plan-2021 \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               the   land   of   the   village   Makaura   is   reserved   for \r\n\r\n               \"residential\"   of   which   the   respondent   No.2   invoked \r\n\r\n               Section   17(1)   and   sub-section   4   of   the   Act   by \r\n\r\n               dispensing with an enquiry under Section 5-A of the \r\n\r\n               Act. The said action on the part of the respondents are \r\n\r\n               un-warranted   and   is   in   gross   violation   of   Article \r\n\r\n               14,19,21   and   300A   of   the   Constitution.     The   such \r\n\r\n               illegal   act   on  the   part   of  the  respondents   show   mala \r\n\r\n               fide   and   their   oblique   motive   to   deprive   the   owners \r\n\r\n               from   their   houses   in   order   to   fulfill   their   political \r\n\r\n               obligations/ promise to the private builders by taking \r\n\r\n               the shelter of Section 17 of the Act by dispensing with \r\n\r\n               the  enquiry  under Section   5-A  of the  Act as  well  as \r\n\r\n               overlooked   purpose   as   stipulated   in   the   Master   Plan \r\n\r\n               2021   which   is   any   way   do   not   require   any   urgent \r\n\r\n               attention.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n               However, in the affidavit, this para has not been sworn at \r\n\r\n               all   and   in   any   case   with   respect   to   dispensation   of \r\n\r\n               enquiry under Section 5-A by invoking  Section 17(4) of \r\n\r\n               the Act nothing has been said except that the exercise of \r\n\r\n               power is violative of Articles 14,19, 21 and 300-A of the \r\n\r\n               Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n               We, therefore, do not find any occasion even to call upon \r\n\r\n               the   respondents   to   file   a   counter   affidavit   placing   on \r\n\r\n               record,   the   material   if   any   for   exercising   power   under \r\n\r\n               Section   17(1)   and   (4)   of   the   Act   in   the   absence   of   any \r\n\r\n               relevant   pleading   or   material   and   the   question   of \r\n\r\n               requiring the respondents to produce the original record \r\n\r\n               in this regard also does not arise.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8.     The   High   Court   distinguished   the   judgment   of   this   Court   in  Om \r\n\r\n\r\nPrakash   v.   State   of   U.P.  (1998)   6   SCC   1,   albeit   without   assigning   any \r\n\r\n\r\ncogent   reason,   relied   upon   the   judgments   of   the   Division   Benches   in \r\n\r\n\r\nKshama Sahkari Avas Samiti Ltd. v. State of U.P.  2007 (1) AWC 327, \r\n\r\n\r\nJasraj Singh v. State of U.P. 2008 (8) ADJ 329 and Jagriti Sahkari Avas \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSamiti Ltd. Ghaziabad v. State of U.P. 2008 (9) ADJ 43 and held that the \r\n\r\n\r\ndecision of the Government to invoke Section 17(1) cannot be subjected to \r\n\r\n\r\njudicial   review.   The   High   Court   also   rejected   the   appellants\'   plea   that   in \r\n\r\n\r\nterms  of  the  policy  framed by  the   State   Government, the  land   covered   by \r\n\r\n\r\nabadi cannot be acquired by observing that no material has been placed on \r\n\r\n\r\nrecord   to   show   that   the   policy   framed   in   1991   was   still   continuing.     To \r\n\r\n\r\nbuttress   this   conclusion,   the   High   Court   relied   upon   the   judgment   of   this \r\n\r\n\r\nCourt in Anand Buttons Limited v. State of Haryana (2005) 9 SCC 164.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9.      By an order dated 29.10.2010, this Court, after taking cognizance of \r\n\r\n\r\nthe fact that the respondents did not get opportunity to file reply to the writ \r\n\r\n\r\npetition, directed them to do so. Thereupon, Shri Harnam Singh, Additional \r\n\r\n\r\nDistrict   Magistrate   (Land   Acquisition)/Officer   on   Special   Duty   (Land \r\n\r\n\r\nAcquisition) NOIDA, District Gautam Budh Nagar filed counter affidavit on \r\n\r\n\r\nbehalf   of   respondent   Nos.1   to   3.     In   paragraph   10   of   his   affidavit,   Shri \r\n\r\n\r\nHarnam  Singh   has   attempted   to   justify   invoking   of   the   urgency   clause   by \r\n\r\n\r\nmaking the following assertions:\r\n\r\n\r\n                \"That   in   invoking   the   urgency   clause   the   State \r\n\r\n                Government   has   taken   into   consideration   the   following \r\n\r\n                factors:-\r\n\r\n\r\n                i)      Greater   Noida   Industrial   Development   Authority \r\n\r\n                was   constituted   under   the   U.P.   Industrial   Area \r\n\r\n                Development Act, 1976 to promote Industrial and Urban \r\n\r\n                Development   in   the   Area.     The   acquired   land   was \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             urgently   required   by   the   Development   Authority   for \r\n\r\n             planned Industrial Development of the area.\r\n\r\n\r\n             ii)     That the land in the adjoining villages were already \r\n\r\n             acquired   by   the   Greater   Noida   Industrial   Development \r\n\r\n             Authority.  Thus, the acquired land was urgently required \r\n\r\n             for   continuity   of   infrastructure   services   and   planned \r\n\r\n             Industrial   Development   of   the   Area.     If,   the   proposed \r\n\r\n             land   was   not   acquired   immediately   and   delay   in   this \r\n\r\n             regard would lead to encroachments and would adversely \r\n\r\n             affect the Planned Industrial Development of the Area.\r\n\r\n\r\n             iii)    That   the   acquired   land   was   required   for   overall \r\n\r\n             development   i.e.   construction   of   roads,   laying   of \r\n\r\n             sewerages,   providing   electricity   etc.   in   the   area   and  the \r\n\r\n             said   scheme   has   been   duly   approved   by   the   state \r\n\r\n             government.\r\n\r\n\r\n             iv)     That   the   acquired   land   consists   of   246   plots \r\n\r\n             numbers with 392 recorded tenure holders.  If objections \r\n\r\n             are   to   be   invited   and   hearing   be   given   to   such   large \r\n\r\n             number   of   tenure   holders,   it   would   take   long   time   to \r\n\r\n             dispose of the objections thereof and would hamper the \r\n\r\n             planned development of the area.\r\n\r\n\r\n             v)      That   reputed   industrial   houses   who   are   interested \r\n\r\n                     in investing in the State and in case the land is not \r\n\r\n                     readily available, they might move to other states \r\n\r\n                     and   such   a   move   would   adversely   affect   the \r\n\r\n                     employment opportunities in the State.\"                  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Shri   Harnam   Singh   also   controverted   the   appellants\'   plea   for \r\n\r\n\r\nexemption by stating that the constructions made by them on land of Khasra \r\n\r\n\r\nNos.101 and 399 were insignificant  and the construction raised on Khasra \r\n\r\n\r\nNo.394 is not part of village Abadi.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10.     Shri   Manoj   Kumar   Singh,   Tehsildar   filed   a   separate   affidavit   on \r\n\r\n\r\nbehalf of Respondent No.4 and justified the invoking of urgency clause by \r\n\r\n\r\nasserting that large tracts of land were acquired for industrial development \r\n\r\n\r\nof the district.  According to him, as per the policy of industrial development \r\n\r\n\r\nof   the   State   Government,   the   land   is   required   to   be   allotted   to   industrial \r\n\r\n\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\n\r\n11.     On   8.11.2010,  Shri   Dinesh   Dwivedi  learned   senior   counsel   for   the \r\n\r\n\r\nState   made   a   request   for   permission   to   file   additional   affidavit   with   some \r\n\r\n\r\ndocuments. His request was accepted.   Thereafter, the respondents filed an \r\n\r\n\r\naffidavit   of   Shri   Sushil   Kumar   Chaubey,   Tehsildar,   Land   Acquisition, \r\n\r\n\r\nGautam Budh Nagar along with eight documents of which seven have been \r\n\r\n\r\ncollectively marked as Annexure A-1.     The first of the documents marked \r\n\r\n\r\nAnnexure A-1 is copy of letter dated 25.2.2008 sent by the Commissioner \r\n\r\n\r\nand Director, Directorate of Land Acquisition, Revenue Board, U.P. to the \r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial   Secretary,   Industrial   Development   on   the   subject   of   issuance   of \r\n\r\n\r\nnotification   under   Sections   4   and   17   of   the   Act   for   acquisition   of   lands \r\n\r\n\r\nmeasuring 205.0288 hectares of village Makora.  The second document is an \r\n\r\n\r\nundated   letter   signed   by   Deputy   Chief   Executive   Officer,   Greater   Noida, \r\n\r\n\r\nCollector,  Gautam Budh Nagar and four other  officers/officials.    The  next \r\n\r\n\r\ndocument has been  described as comments/certificate on the issues raised in \r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment Order No.5261/77-4-06-251N/06 dated 21.12.2006 with regard \r\n\r\n\r\nto   proposal   for   acquisition   of   205.0288   hectares   lands   in   village   Makora. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis   document   is   accompanied   by   seven   forms   containing   various \r\n\r\n\r\nparticulars.  The third document is communication dated 29.10.2007 sent by \r\n\r\n\r\nthe   Commissioner,   Meerut   Division,   Meerut   to   the   District   Magistrate, \r\n\r\n\r\nGautam Budh Nagar conveying  the consent  of the Divisional Land Utility \r\n\r\n\r\nCommittee  for the acquisition of   lands of five villages including Makora. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter is accompanied by minutes of the meeting of the Divisional Land \r\n\r\n\r\nUtility Committee held on 29.10.2007.  The fifth document is form No.43A-\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  The sixth document is communication dated 22.2.2008 sent by Collector, \r\n\r\n\r\nLand Acquisition/Special Land Acquisition Officer, Greater Noida.  The last \r\n\r\n\r\ndocument which forms part of Annexure A-1 is form No.16 showing the list \r\n\r\n\r\nof properties having constructions etc.  Annexure A-2 is copy of letter dated \r\n\r\n\r\n31.10.2008   sent   by   the   Director,   Directorate   of   Land   Acquisition   to   the \r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial Secretary, Industrial Development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12.     Shri   N.P.Singh,   learned   counsel   for   the   appellants   argued   that   the \r\n\r\n\r\nimpugned   order   is   liable   to   be   set   aside   because   the   High   Court   failed   to \r\n\r\n\r\nconsider   the   issues   raised   in   the   writ   petition   in   a   correct   perspective. \r\n\r\n\r\nLearned counsel submitted that the appellants had specifically pleaded that \r\n\r\n\r\nthere was no valid ground to invoke the urgency clause contained in Section \r\n\r\n\r\n17(1) and to dispense with the application of Section 5-A but the High Court \r\n\r\n\r\ndid not even call upon the respondents to file counter affidavit and brushed \r\n\r\n\r\naside   the   challenge   to   the   acquisition   proceeding   on   a   wholly   untenable \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npremise  that  the  affidavit filed in support of the writ  petition was laconic. \r\n\r\n\r\nLearned counsel further argued that the purpose for which land was acquired \r\n\r\n\r\ni.e. planned industrial development of the district did not justify invoking of \r\n\r\n\r\nthe urgency provisions and denial of opportunity to the appellants and other \r\n\r\n\r\nland owners to file objections under Section 5-A (1) and to be heard by the \r\n\r\n\r\nCollector   in   terms   of   the   mandate   of   Section   5-A   (2).   In   support   of   his \r\n\r\n\r\nargument,  learned  counsel   relied   upon  the   judgments  in  Narayan   Govind \r\n\r\n\r\nGavate v. State of Maharashtra (1977) 1 SCC 133 and Esso Fabs Private \r\n\r\n\r\nLimited v. State of Haryana  (2009) 2 SCC 377. Another argument of the \r\n\r\n\r\nlearned   counsel   is   that   the   High   Court   misdirected   itself   in   summarily \r\n\r\n\r\ndismissing the writ petition ignoring the substantive plea of discrimination \r\n\r\n\r\nraised by the appellants. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13.     Shri   Dinesh   Dwivedi,   learned   senior   counsel   appearing   for   the \r\n\r\n\r\nrespondents urged that this Court should   not nullify the acquisition at the \r\n\r\n\r\ninstance of the appellants because the pleadings filed before the High Court \r\n\r\n\r\nwere not supported by proper affidavit. Shri Dwivedi argued that the High \r\n\r\n\r\nCourt   was   justified   in   non-suiting   the   appellants   because   they   did   not \r\n\r\n\r\nproduce   any   evidence   to   effectively   challenge   the   invoking   of   urgency \r\n\r\n\r\nprovision   contained   in   Section   17(1).   Learned   senior   counsel   emphasized \r\n\r\n\r\nthat the satisfaction envisaged in Section 17(1) is purely subjective and the \r\n\r\n\r\nCourt cannot review the decision taken by the State Government to invoke \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   urgency   clause.   He   submitted   that   planned   industrial   development   of \r\n\r\n\r\nDistrict   Gautam   Budh   Nagar   is   being   undertaken   in   consonance   with   the \r\n\r\n\r\npolicy decision taken by the State Government and the appellants cannot be \r\n\r\n\r\nheard to make a grievance against the acquisition of their land because they \r\n\r\n\r\nwill be duly compensated. In support of his argument, Shri Dwivedi relied \r\n\r\n\r\nupon the judgment of this Court in State of U.P. v. Pista Devi (1986) 4 SCC \r\n\r\n\r\n251 and Chameli Singh v. State of U.P. (1996) 2 SCC 549.  Learned senior \r\n\r\n\r\ncounsel further submitted that the appellants\' land cannot be released from \r\n\r\n\r\nacquisition   because   that   will   result   in   frustrating   the   objective   of   planned \r\n\r\n\r\nindustrial   development  of  the  district.   On the  issue of discrimination,  Shri \r\n\r\n\r\nDwivedi argued that even  if the land belonging to some persons has been \r\n\r\n\r\nillegally   left   out   from   acquisition,   the   appellants   are   not   entitled   to   a \r\n\r\n\r\ndirection that their land should also be released.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14.     The first issue which needs to be addressed is whether the High Court \r\n\r\n\r\nwas justified in non-suiting  the appellants on the ground that they had not \r\n\r\n\r\nraised a specific plea supported by a proper affidavit to question the decision \r\n\r\n\r\ntaken by the State Government to invoke Section 17(1) and 17(4) of the Act. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall also consider an ancillary issue   as to whether the appellants had \r\n\r\n\r\nsucceeded   in prima facie proving   that there was no justification to invoke \r\n\r\n\r\nthe urgency clause and to dispense with the inquiry envisaged under Section \r\n\r\n\r\n5-A.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15.           At   the   outset,   we   record   our   disapproval   of   the   casual   manner   in \r\n\r\n\r\nwhich the High Court disposed of the writ petition without even calling upon \r\n\r\n\r\nthe respondents to file counter affidavit and produce the relevant records. A \r\n\r\n\r\nreading of the averments contained in paragraphs 11 and 16 and grounds A \r\n\r\n\r\nand F of the writ petition, which have been extracted hereinabove   coupled \r\n\r\n\r\nwith the appellants\' assertion that the acquisition of their land was vitiated \r\n\r\n\r\ndue to discrimination inasmuch as  land belonging to influential persons had \r\n\r\n\r\nbeen left out from acquisition, but their land was acquired in total disregard \r\n\r\n\r\nof the policy of the State Government to leave out  land on which dwelling \r\n\r\n\r\nunits had already been constructed, show that they had succeeded in making \r\n\r\n\r\nout   a   strong   case   for   deeper   examination   of   the   issues   raised   in   the   writ \r\n\r\n\r\npetition     and   the  High   Court    committed   serious   error   by   summarily   non-\r\n\r\n\r\nsuiting them. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16.     The history of land acquisition legislations shows that in Eighteenth \r\n\r\n\r\nCentury, Bengal Regulation I of 1824, Act I of 1850, Act VI of 1857, Act \r\n\r\n\r\nXXII of 1863, Act X of 1870, Bombay Act No. XXVIII of 1839, Bombay \r\n\r\n\r\nAct No. XVII of 1850, Madras Act No. XX of 1852 and Madras Act No.1 of \r\n\r\n\r\n1854 were enacted to facilitate the acquisition of land and other immovable \r\n\r\n\r\nproperties for roads, canals, and other public purposes by paying the amount \r\n\r\n\r\nto be determined by the arbitrators.  In 1870, the Land Acquisition Act was \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenacted   to   provide   for   proper   valuation   of   the   acquired   land.     That   Act \r\n\r\n\r\nenvisaged that if the person having interest in   land is not agreeable to part \r\n\r\n\r\nwith possession by accepting the amount offered to him, then the Collector \r\n\r\n\r\nmay   make   a   reference   to   the   Civil   Court.   The   1870   Act   also   envisaged \r\n\r\n\r\nappointment   of   assessors   to   assist   the   Civil   Court.     If   the   Court   and   the \r\n\r\n\r\nassessor   did not  agree  on  the amount  then an  appeal  could be  filed  in  the \r\n\r\n\r\nHigh   Court.     This   mechanism   proved   ineffective   because   lot   of   time   was \r\n\r\n\r\nconsumed   in   litigation.     With   a   view   to   overcome   this   problem,   the \r\n\r\n\r\nlegislature   enacted   the   Act   on   the   line   of   the   English   Lands   Clauses \r\n\r\n\r\nConsolidation   Act,   1845.     However,   the   land   owners   or   persons   having \r\n\r\n\r\ninterest in land did not have any say in the acquisition process either under \r\n\r\n\r\npre-1984   legislations   or   the   1984   Act   (un-amended).   They   could   raise \r\n\r\n\r\nobjection   only   qua   the   amount   of   compensation   and   matters   connected \r\n\r\n\r\ntherewith.     The   absence   of   opportunity   to   raise   objection   against   the \r\n\r\n\r\nacquisition of land was resented by those who were deprived of their land. \r\n\r\n\r\nTo redress this grievance, Section 5A was inserted in the Act by amending \r\n\r\n\r\nAct No.38 of 1923.  The statement of Objects and Reasons contained in Bill \r\n\r\n\r\nNo.29 of 1923, which led to enactment of the amending Act read as under:\r\n\r\n\r\n                \"The   Land   Acquisition   Act   I   of   1894   does   not   provide \r\n\r\n                that   persons   having   an   interest   in   land   which   it   is \r\n\r\n                proposed to acquire, shall have the right of objecting to \r\n\r\n                such   acquisition;   nor   is   Government   bound   to   enquire \r\n\r\n                into   and   consider   any   objections   that   may   reach   them. \r\n\r\n                The   object   of   this   Bill   is   to   provide   that   a   Local \r\n\r\n                Government shall not declare, under Section 6 of the Act, \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            that any land is needed for a public purpose unless time \r\n\r\n            has   been   allowed   after   the   notification   under   Section   4 \r\n\r\n            for persons interested in the land to put in objections and \r\n\r\n            for   such   objections   to   be   considered   by   the   Local \r\n\r\n            Government.\"   \r\n\r\n\r\n17.             The   Act,   which   was   enacted   more   than   116   years   ago   for \r\n\r\n\r\nfacilitating   the   acquisition   of   land   and   other   immovable   properties   for \r\n\r\n\r\nconstruction of roads, canals, railways etc., has been frequently used in \r\n\r\n\r\nthe   post   independence   era   for   different   public   purposes   like   laying   of \r\n\r\n\r\nroads,     construction   of   bridges,   dams   and   buildings   of   various   public \r\n\r\n\r\nestablishments/institutions,   planned   development   of   urban   areas, \r\n\r\n\r\nproviding   of   houses   to   different   sections   of   the   society   and   for \r\n\r\n\r\ndeveloping residential colonies/sectors.  However, in the recent years, the \r\n\r\n\r\ncountry has witnessed a new phenomena.  Large tracts of land have been \r\n\r\n\r\nacquired in   rural parts of the country in the name of development and \r\n\r\n\r\ntransferred   to   private   entrepreneurs,   who   have   utilized   the   same   for \r\n\r\n\r\nconstruction   of   multi-storied   complexes,   commercial   centers   and   for \r\n\r\n\r\nsetting up industrial units.   Similarly, large scale acquisitions have been \r\n\r\n\r\nmade on behalf of the companies by invoking the provisions contained in \r\n\r\n\r\nPart VII of the Act. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18.       The resultant effect of these acquisitions is that the land owners, \r\n\r\n\r\nwho  were doing  agricultural   operations  and  other  ancillary   activities   in \r\n\r\n\r\nrural   areas,   have   been   deprived   of   the   only   source   of   their   livelihood. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMajority of them do not have any idea about their constitutional and legal \r\n\r\n\r\nrights,   which   can   be   enforced   by   availing   the   constitutional   remedies \r\n\r\n\r\nunder   Articles   32   and   226   of   the   Constitution.     They   reconcile   with \r\n\r\n\r\ndeprivation of land by accepting the amount of compensation offered by \r\n\r\n\r\nthe   Government   and   by   thinking   that   it   is   their   fate   and   destiny \r\n\r\n\r\ndetermined   by   God.     Even   those   who   get   semblance   of   education   are \r\n\r\n\r\nneither   conversant   with   the   functioning   of  the  State   apparatus   nor   they \r\n\r\n\r\ncan access the records prepared by the concerned authorities as a prelude \r\n\r\n\r\nto the acquisition of   land by invoking Section 4 with or without the aid \r\n\r\n\r\nof   Section   17(1)   and/or   17(4).       Therefore,   while   examining   the   land \r\n\r\n\r\nowner\'s   challenge   to   the   acquisition   of   land   in   a   petition   filed   under \r\n\r\n\r\nArticle   226   of   the   Constitution,     the   High   Court   should   not   adopt   a \r\n\r\n\r\npedantic approach, as has been done in the present case, and decide the \r\n\r\n\r\nmatter  keeping  in  view the  constitutional   goals  of  social  and  economic \r\n\r\n\r\njustice and the fact that even though the right to property is no longer a \r\n\r\n\r\nfundamental right, the same continues to be an important constitutional \r\n\r\n\r\nright   and   in   terms   of   Article   300-A,   no   person   can   be   deprived   of   his \r\n\r\n\r\nproperty   except   by   authority   of   law.     In   cases   where   the   acquisition   is \r\n\r\n\r\nmade   by   invoking   Section   4   read   with   Section   17(1)   and/or   17(4),   the \r\n\r\n\r\nHigh Court should insist upon filing of reply affidavit by the respondents \r\n\r\n\r\nand production of the relevant records and carefully scrutinize the same \r\n\r\n\r\nbefore   pronouncing   upon   legality   of   the   impugned   notification/action \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause a negative result without examining the relevant records to find \r\n\r\n\r\nout whether the competent authority had formed a bona fide opinion on \r\n\r\n\r\nthe issue of invoking the urgency provision and excluding the application \r\n\r\n\r\nof Section 5-A is likely to make the land owner a landless poor and force \r\n\r\n\r\nhim to migrate to the nearby city only to live in a slum.  A departure from \r\n\r\n\r\nthis   rule   should   be   made   only   when   land   is   required   to   meet   really \r\n\r\n\r\nemergent   situations   like   those   enumerated   in   Section   17(2).     If   the \r\n\r\n\r\nacquisition   is   intended   to   benefit   private   person(s)   and   the   provisions \r\n\r\n\r\ncontained in Section 17(1) and/or 17(4) are invoked, then scrutiny of the \r\n\r\n\r\njustification   put forward  by  the  State  should  be  more  rigorous  in cases \r\n\r\n\r\ninvolving the challenge to the acquisition of land, the pleadings should be \r\n\r\n\r\nliberally   construed   and   relief   should   not   be   denied   to   the   petitioner   by \r\n\r\n\r\napplying the technical rules of procedure embodied in the Code of Civil \r\n\r\n\r\nProcedure and other procedural laws. In this context it will be profitable \r\n\r\n\r\nto   notice   the   observations   made   by   this   Court   in  Authorised   Officer, \r\n\r\n\r\nThanjavur   v.   S   Naganatha   Ayyar  (1979)   3   SCC   466,   which   are     as \r\n\r\n\r\nunder:\r\n\r\n\r\n            \"It is true that Judges are constitutional invigilators \r\n\r\n            and   statutory   interpreters;   but   they   are   also   responsive \r\n\r\n            and responsible to Part IV of the Constitution being one \r\n\r\n            of  the   trinity   of  the  nation\'s   appointed   instrumentalities \r\n\r\n            in   the   transformation   of   the   socio-economic   order.   The \r\n\r\n            judiciary, in its sphere, shares the revolutionary purpose \r\n\r\n            of   the   constitutional   order,   and   when   called   upon   to \r\n\r\n            decode   social   legislation   must   be   animated   by   a   goal-\r\n\r\n            oriented   approach.   This   is   part   of   the   dynamics   of \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                statutory   interpretation   in   the   developing   countries   so \r\n\r\n                that courts are not converted into rescue shelters for those \r\n\r\n                who  seek  to  defeat  agrarian  justice  by  cute  transactions \r\n\r\n                of   many   manifestations   now   so   familiar   in   the   country \r\n\r\n                and   illustrated   by   the   several   cases   under   appeal.   This \r\n\r\n                caveat has become necessary because the judiciary is not \r\n\r\n                a mere umpire, as some assume, but an activist catalyst in \r\n\r\n                the constitutional scheme.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19.     We may now advert to the ancillary question whether the High Court \r\n\r\n\r\nwas justified in non suiting the appellants on the ground that they failed to \r\n\r\n\r\ndischarge   the   primary   burden   of   proving   that   the   State   Government   had \r\n\r\n\r\ninvoked Section 17(1) and 17(4) without application of mind to the relevant \r\n\r\n\r\nconsiderations.   In this context, it is apposite to observe that while dealing \r\n\r\n\r\nwith challenge to the acquisition  of land belonging to those who suffer from \r\n\r\n\r\nhandicaps of poverty, illiteracy and ignorance and do not have the resources \r\n\r\n\r\nto access the material relied upon by the functionaries of the   State and its \r\n\r\n\r\nagencies for forming an opinion or recording a satisfaction that the urgency \r\n\r\n\r\nprovisions   contained   in   Section   17(1)   should   be   resorted   to   and/or   the \r\n\r\n\r\nenquiry   envisaged   under   Section   5A   should     be   dispensed   with,   the   High \r\n\r\n\r\nCourt   should   not   literally   apply   the   abstract   rules   of   burden   of   proof \r\n\r\n\r\nenshrined   in   the   Evidence   Act.     It   is   too   much   to   expect   from   the   rustic \r\n\r\n\r\nvillagers, who are not conversant with the intricacies of law and functioning \r\n\r\n\r\nof the judicial system in our country to first obtain relevant information and \r\n\r\n\r\nrecords   from   the   concerned   State   authorities   and   then   present   skillfully \r\n\r\n\r\ndrafted petition for enforcement of his legal and/or constitutional rights. The \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCourt should also bear in mind that the relevant records are always  in the \r\n\r\n\r\nexclusive   possession/domain   of   the   authorities   of   the   State   and/or   its \r\n\r\n\r\nagencies.     Therefore,   an   assertion   by   the   appellants   that   there   was   no \r\n\r\n\r\nurgency   in   the   acquisition   of   land;   that   the   concerned   authorities   did   not \r\n\r\n\r\napply  mind  to  the  relevant  factors  and  records  and  arbitrarily  invoked  the \r\n\r\n\r\nurgency   provisions   and   thereby   denied   him   the   minimum   opportunity   of \r\n\r\n\r\nhearing in terms of Section 5-A(1) and (2), should be treated as sufficient \r\n\r\n\r\nfor   calling   upon   the   respondents   to   file   their   response   and   produce   the \r\n\r\n\r\nrelevant records to justify the invoking of urgency provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n20.     In  Narayan   Govind   Gavate   v.   State   of   Maharashtra  (supra),   the \r\n\r\n\r\nthree-Judge Bench of this Court examined the correctness of the judgment \r\n\r\n\r\nof   the   Bombay   High   Court   whereby   the   acquisition   of   land   by   the   State \r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment by issuing notification under Section 4 read with Section 17(1) \r\n\r\n\r\nand 17(4) for development and utilisation as residential and industrial area \r\n\r\n\r\nwas  quashed.   The   High Court held  that  the  purpose  of  acquisition  was a \r\n\r\n\r\ngenuine public purpose but quashed the notifications by observing that the \r\n\r\n\r\nburden   of   proving   the   existence   of   circumstances   which   could   justify \r\n\r\n\r\ninvoking   of   urgency   clause   was   on   the   State,   which   it   had   failed   to \r\n\r\n\r\ndischarge. Some of the observations made by the High Court, which have \r\n\r\n\r\nbeen extracted in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the judgment of this Court, are \r\n\r\n\r\nreproduced below.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When the formation of an opinion or the satisfaction of \r\n\r\nan authority is subjective but is a condition precedent to \r\n\r\nthe exercise of a power, the challenge to the formation of \r\n\r\nsuch opinion or to such satisfaction is limited, in law, to \r\n\r\nthree   points   only.   It   can   be   challenged,   firstly,   on   the \r\n\r\nground   of   mala   fides;   secondly,   on   the   ground   that   the \r\n\r\nauthority which formed that opinion or which arrived at \r\n\r\nsuch satisfaction did not apply its mind to the material on \r\n\r\nwhich it formed the opinion or arrived at the satisfaction, \r\n\r\nand,   thirdly,   that   the   material   on   which   it   formed   its \r\n\r\nopinion   or   reached   the   satisfaction   was   so   insufficient \r\n\r\nthat no man  could reasonably  reach that conclusion.  So \r\n\r\nfar as the third point is concerned, no court of law can, as \r\n\r\nin an appeal, consider that, on the material placed before \r\n\r\nthe   authority,   the   authority   was   justified   in   reaching   its \r\n\r\nconclusion.   The   court   can   interfere   only   in   such   cases \r\n\r\nwhere there was no material at all or the material was so \r\n\r\ninsufficient   that   no   man   could   have   reasonably   reached \r\n\r\nthat conclusion. \r\n\r\nIn   the   case   before   us   the   petitioner   has   stated   in   the \r\n\r\npetition more than once that the urgency clause had been \r\n\r\napplied without any valid reason. The urgency clause in \r\n\r\nrespect of each of the said two notifications  concerning \r\n\r\nthe lands in Groups 1 and 2 is contained in the relative \r\n\r\nSection 4 notification itself. The public purpose stated in \r\n\r\nthe notification is `for development and utilization of the \r\n\r\nsaid lands as an industrial and residential area\'. To start \r\n\r\nwith, this statement itself is vague, in the sense that it is \r\n\r\nnot clear whether the development and utilization of the \r\n\r\nlands   referred   to   in   that   statement   was   confined   to   the \r\n\r\nlands mentioned in the schedule to the notification or it \r\n\r\napplied to a wider area of which such lands formed only \r\n\r\na   part.   So   far   as   the   affidavit   in   reply   is   concerned,   no \r\n\r\nfacts   whatever   are   stated.   The   affidavit   only   states   that \r\n\r\nthe   authority   i.e.   the   Commissioner   of   the   Bombay \r\n\r\nDivision   was   satisfied   that   the   possession   of   the   said \r\n\r\nlands  was  urgently   required   for the  purpose   of  carrying \r\n\r\nout   the   said   development.   Even   Mr   Setalvad   conceded \r\n\r\nthat the affidavit does not contain a statement of facts on \r\n\r\nwhich the authority was satisfied or on which it formed \r\n\r\nits   opinion.  It   is,   therefore,   quite   clear   that   the \r\n\r\nrespondents  have failed  to bring on record any material \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                whatever   on   which   the   respondents   formed   the   opinion \r\n\r\n                mentioned   in   the   two   notifications.  The   notifications \r\n\r\n                themselves show that they concern many lands other than \r\n\r\n                those   falling   in   the   said   first   and   third   groups.   It   is   not \r\n\r\n                possible   to   know   what   was   the   development   for   which \r\n\r\n                the lands were being acquired, much less is it possible to \r\n\r\n                know   what   were   the   circumstances   which   caused \r\n\r\n                urgency   in   the   taking   of   possession   of   such   lands.  We \r\n\r\n                have held that the burden of proving such circumstances, \r\n\r\n                at   least   prima   facie   is   on   the   respondents.   As   the \r\n\r\n                respondents   have   brought   no   relevant   material   on   the \r\n\r\n                record,   the   respondents   have   failed   to   discharge   that \r\n\r\n                burden.  We   must,   in   conclusion,   hold   that   the   urgency \r\n\r\n                provision   under   Section   17(4)   was   not   validly   resorted \r\n\r\n                to.\"\r\n\r\n                                                                     (emphasis supplied)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        While   dealing   with   the   argument   of   the   State   that   it   was   for   the \r\n\r\n\r\npetitioner   to   prove   that   there   was   no   material   to   justify   invoking   of   the \r\n\r\n\r\nurgency clause, this Court observed:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"We do not think that a question relating to burden of proof is \r\n\r\n        always free from difficulty or is quite so simple as it is sought \r\n\r\n        to   be   made   out   here.   Indeed,   the   apparent   simplicity   of   a \r\n\r\n        question relating to presumptions and burdens of proof, which \r\n\r\n        have   to   be   always   viewed   together   is   often   deceptive.   Over \r\n\r\n        simplification  of  such  questions  leads  to  erroneous  statements \r\n\r\n        and misapplications of the law.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        The Court then referred to the judgment in Woolmington v. Director \r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Prosecutions,  1935 AC 462, extensively quoted from     Phipson on \r\n\r\n\r\nEvidence (11th Edn),  noticed Sections 101 to 106 of the Evidence Act and \r\n\r\n\r\nobserved:\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Coming   back   to   the   cases   before   us,   we   find   that   the \r\n\r\nHigh   Court   had   correctly   stated   the   grounds   on   which \r\n\r\neven a subjective opinion as to the existence of the need \r\n\r\nto   take   action   under   Section   17(4)   of   the   Act   can   be \r\n\r\nchallenged on certain limited grounds. But, as soon as we \r\n\r\nspeak of a challenge we have to bear in mind the general \r\n\r\nburdens   laid   down   by   Sections   101   and   102   of   the \r\n\r\nEvidence  Act.  It   is  for  the   petitioner  to  substantiate  the \r\n\r\ngrounds of his challenge. This means  that the petitioner \r\n\r\nhas  to either  lead evidence or show  that some  evidence \r\n\r\nhas come from the side of the respondents to indicate that \r\n\r\nhis challenge to a notification or order is made good. If \r\n\r\nhe does not succeed in discharging that duty his petition \r\n\r\nwill fail. But, is that the position in the cases before us? \r\n\r\nWe   find   that,   although   the   High   Court   had   stated   the \r\n\r\nquestion before it to be one which \"narrows down to the \r\n\r\npoint as to the burden of proof\" yet, it had analysed the \r\n\r\nevidence   sufficiently   before   it   to   reach   the   conclusion \r\n\r\nthat   the   urgency   provision   under   Section   17(4)   had   not \r\n\r\nbeen validly resorted to.\r\n\r\n                                              \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n We think that the original or stable onus laid down by \r\n\r\nSection 101 and Section 102 of the Evidence Act cannot \r\n\r\nbe shifted by the use of Section 106 of the Evidence Act, \r\n\r\nalthough   the   particular   onus   of   providing   facts   and \r\n\r\ncircumstances   lying   especially   within   the   knowledge   of \r\n\r\nthe official who formed the opinion which resulted in the \r\n\r\nnotification   under   Section   17   (4)   of   the   Act   rests   upon \r\n\r\nthat   official.   The   recital,   if   it   is   not   defective,   may \r\n\r\nobviate   the   need   to   look   further.   But,   there   may   be \r\n\r\ncircumstances in the case which impel the court to look \r\n\r\nbeyond it. And, at that stage, Section 106 Evidence Act \r\n\r\ncan   be   invoked   by   the   party   assailing   an   order   or \r\n\r\nnotification.   It   is   most   unsafe   in   such   cases   for   the \r\n\r\nofficial or authority concerned to rest content which non-\r\n\r\ndisclosure of facts especially within his or its knowledge \r\n\r\nby relying on the sufficiency of a recital. Such an attitude \r\n\r\nmay itself justify further judicial scrutiny.\r\n\r\n                                              \r\n\r\nIn   the   cases   before   us,   if   the   total   evidence   from \r\n\r\nwhichever side any of it may have come, was insufficient \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            to   enable   the   petitioners   to   discharge   their   general   or \r\n\r\n            stable   onus,   their   petitions   could   not   succeed.   On   the \r\n\r\n            other hand, if, in addition to the bare assertions made by \r\n\r\n            the petitioners, that the urgency contemplated by Section \r\n\r\n            17(4)   did   not   exist,   there   were   other   facts   and \r\n\r\n            circumstances,   including   the   failure   of   the   State   to \r\n\r\n            indicate   facts   and   circumstances   which   it   could   have \r\n\r\n            easily  disclosed  if  they  existed, the petitioners  could be \r\n\r\n            held to have discharged their general onus.\r\n\r\n                                                            \r\n\r\n            It is also clear that, even a technically correct recital in an \r\n\r\n            order or notification stating that the conditions precedent \r\n\r\n            to   the   exercise   of   a   power   have   been   fulfilled   may   not \r\n\r\n            debar   the   court   in   a   given   case   from   considering   the \r\n\r\n            question   whether,   in   fact,   those   conditions   have   been \r\n\r\n            fulfilled.     And,   a   fortiori,   the   court   may   consider   and \r\n\r\n            decide   whether   the   authority   concerned   has   applied   its \r\n\r\n            mind   to   really   relevant   facts   of   a   case   with   a   view   to \r\n\r\n            determining that a condition precedent to the exercise of \r\n\r\n            a   power   has   been   fulfilled.     If   it   appears,   upon   an \r\n\r\n            examination  of  the  totality   of facts   in  the  case,   that  the \r\n\r\n            power conferred has been exercised for an extraneous or \r\n\r\n            irrelevant purpose or that the mind has not been applied \r\n\r\n            at all to the real object or purpose of a power, so that the \r\n\r\n            result is that the exercise of power could only serve some \r\n\r\n            other or collateral object, the court will interfere.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court finally held as under:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            \"There is no indication whatsoever in the \r\n\r\n            affidavit   filed   on   behalf   of   the   State   the   mind   of   the \r\n\r\n            Commissioner was applied at all to the question whether \r\n\r\n            it was a case necessitating the elimination of the enquiry \r\n\r\n            under   Section5A   of   the   Act.   The   recitals   in   the \r\n\r\n            notifications, on the other hand, indicate that elimination \r\n\r\n            of the enquiry under Section 5A of the Act was treated as \r\n\r\n            an automatic consequence of the opinion formed on other \r\n\r\n            matters.  The  recital does not say  at all that any opinion \r\n\r\n            was   formed   on   the   need   to   dispense   with   the   enquiry \r\n\r\n            under   Section   5A   of   the   Act.   It   is   certainly   a   case   in \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               which   the   recital   was   at   least   defective.   The   burden, \r\n\r\n               therefore, rested upon the State to remove the defect, if \r\n\r\n               possible,   by   evidence   to   show   that   some   exceptional \r\n\r\n               circumstances   which   necessitated   the   elimination   of   an \r\n\r\n               enquiry under Section 5A of the Act and that the mind of \r\n\r\n               the Commissioner was applied to this essential question. \r\n\r\n               It seems to us that the High Court correctly   applied the \r\n\r\n               provisions   of  Section   106  of  the   Evidence   Act   to  place \r\n\r\n               the   burden   upon   the   State     to   prove   those   special \r\n\r\n               circumstances,   although   it   also   appears   to   us   that   the \r\n\r\n               High Court was quite correct in stating its view in such a \r\n\r\n               manner as to make it appear that some part of the initial \r\n\r\n               burden of the petitioners  under Sections 101 and 102 of \r\n\r\n               the Evidence Act had been displaced by the failure of the \r\n\r\n               State to discharge  its duty under Section 106 of the Act. \r\n\r\n               The correct way of putting it would have been to say that \r\n\r\n               the failure of the State  to produce the evidence of facts \r\n\r\n               especially   within   the   knowledge   of   its   officials,   which \r\n\r\n               rested   upon   it   under   Section   106   of   the   Evidence   Act, \r\n\r\n               taken together with the attendant facts and circumstances \r\n\r\n               including   the   contents   of   recitals,   had   enabled   the \r\n\r\n               petitioners to discharge  their burden under Sections 101 \r\n\r\n               and 102 of the Evidence Act.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                              (emphasis supplied)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21.     The ratio of the aforesaid judgment was recently followed by the two-\r\n\r\n\r\nJudge  Bench   in  Anand  Singh  v. State  of Uttar  Pradesh  (2010)  11 SCC \r\n\r\n\r\n242.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n22.     We   shall   now   consider   whether   there   was   any   valid   ground   or \r\n\r\n\r\njustification for invoking the urgency provision contained in Section 17(1) \r\n\r\n\r\nand to exclude the application of Section 5A for the acquisition of land for \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplanned   industrial   development   of   the   district.

Special powers in case of urgency. - (1) In cases of \r\n\r\nurgency   whenever   the   appropriate   Government,   so \r\n\r\ndirects,   the   Collector,   though   no   such   award   has   been \r\n\r\nmade,   may,   on   the   expiration   of   fifteen   days   from   the \r\n\r\npublication   of   the   notice   mentioned   in   section   9,   sub-\r\n\r\nsection   (1)   take   possession   of   any   land   needed   for   a \r\n\r\npublic purpose. Such land shall thereupon vest absolutely \r\n\r\nin the Government, free from all encumbrances.\r\n\r\n\r\n(2)   Whenever,   owing   to   any   sudden   change   in   the \r\n\r\nchannel   of   any   navigable   river   or   other   unforeseen \r\n\r\nemergency,   it   becomes   necessary   for   any   Railway \r\n\r\nAdministration   to   acquire   the   immediate   possession   of \r\n\r\nany   land   for   the   maintenance   of   their   traffic   or   for   the \r\n\r\npurpose of making thereon a river-side or ghat station, or \r\n\r\nof providing convenient connection with or access to any \r\n\r\nsuch station, or the appropriate Government considers it \r\n\r\nnecessary   to   acquire   the   immediate   possession   of   any \r\n\r\nland   for   the   purpose   of   maintaining   any   structure   or \r\n\r\nsystem   pertaining   to   irrigation,   water   supply,   drainage, \r\n\r\nroad   communication   or   electricity,   the   Collector   may, \r\n\r\nimmediately after the publication of the notice mentioned \r\n\r\nin sub-section (1) and with the previous sanction  of the \r\n\r\nappropriate Government, enter upon and take possession \r\n\r\nof such land, which shall thereupon vest absolutely in the \r\n\r\nGovernment free from all encumbrances:\r\n\r\n\r\nProvided   that   the  Collector   shall   not  take   possession   of \r\n\r\nany building or part of a building under this sub-section \r\n\r\nwithout giving to the occupier thereof at least forty-eight \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhours\'   notice   of   his   intention   so   to   do,   or   such   longer \r\n\r\nnotice   as   may   be   reasonably   sufficient   to   enable   such \r\n\r\noccupier   to   remove   his   movable   property   from   such \r\n\r\nbuilding   without   unnecessary   inconvenience.                          \r\n\r\n\r\n(3)   In   every   case   under   either   of   the   preceding   sub-\r\n\r\nsections   the   Collector   shall   at   that   time   of   taking \r\n\r\npossession   offer   to   the   persons   interested   compensation \r\n\r\nfor the standing crops and trees (if any) on such land and \r\n\r\nfrom any other damage sustained by them caused by such \r\n\r\nsudden   dispossession   and   not   excepted   in   section   24; \r\n\r\nand, in case such offer is not accepted, the value of such \r\n\r\ncrops   and   trees   and   the   amount   of   such   other   damage \r\n\r\nshall   be   allowed   for   in   awarding   compensation   for   the \r\n\r\nland under the provisions herein contained. \r\n\r\n\r\n(3A)   Before   taking   possession   of   any   land   under   sub-\r\n\r\nsection (1) or sub-section (2), the Collector shall, without \r\n\r\nprejudice to the provisions of sub-section (3)-\r\n\r\n\r\n(a)     tender   payment   of   eighty   per   centum   of   the \r\n\r\ncompensation   for   such   land   as   estimated   by   him   to   the \r\n\r\npersons interested entitled thereto, and \r\n\r\n\r\n(b)     pay   it   to   them,   unless   prevented   by   some   one   or \r\n\r\nmore of the contingencies mentioned in section 31, sub-\r\n\r\nsection (2), \r\n\r\n\r\nand where the Collector is so prevented, the provisions of \r\n\r\nsection   31,   sub-section   (2),   (except   the   second   proviso \r\n\r\nthereto),   shall   apply   as   they   apply   to   the   payment   of \r\n\r\ncompensation under that section. \r\n\r\n\r\n(3B)   The   amount   paid   or   deposited   under   sub-section \r\n\r\n(3A),   shall   be   taken   into   account   for   determining   the \r\n\r\namount   of   compensation   required   to   be   tendered   under \r\n\r\nsection   31,   and   where   the   amount   so   paid   or   deposited \r\n\r\nexceeds   the   compensation   awarded   by   the   Collector \r\n\r\nunder section 11, the excess may, unless refunded within \r\n\r\nthree   months   from   the   date   of   Collector\'s   award,   be \r\n\r\nrecovered as an arrear of land revenue. \r\n\r\n\r\n(4) In the case of any land to which, in the opinion of the \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                appropriate   Government,   the   provisions   of   sub-section \r\n\r\n                (1)   or   sub-section   (2)   are   applicable,   the   appropriate \r\n\r\n                Government may direct that the provisions of section 5A \r\n\r\n                shall not apply, and, if it does so direct, a declaration may \r\n\r\n                be made under section 6 in respect of the land at any time \r\n\r\n                after the date of the publication of the notification under \r\n\r\n                section 4, sub-section (1).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        Section   17   has   been   amended   five   times   by   the   Uttar   Pradesh \r\n\r\n\r\nlegislature.     However,  the   only   amendment   which   is  relevant   for   deciding \r\n\r\n\r\nthis case is the insertion of proviso to Section 17(4) vide Uttar Pradesh Act \r\n\r\n\r\nNo.8 of 1974.  That proviso reads as under:\r\n\r\n\r\n                \"Provided that where in the case of any land, notification \r\n\r\n                under section 4, sub-section (1) has been published in the \r\n\r\n                Official   Gazette   on   or   after   September   24,   1984   but \r\n\r\n                before   January   11,   1989,   and   the   appropriate \r\n\r\n                Government has under this sub-section directed that the \r\n\r\n                provisions   of   section   5A   shall   not   apply,   a   declaration \r\n\r\n                under section 6 in respect of the land may be made either \r\n\r\n                simultaneously with, or at any time after, the publication \r\n\r\n                in the Official Gazette of the notification under section 4, \r\n\r\n                sub-section (1).\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23.     ANALYSIS OF THE PROVISIONS:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Section   4(1)   lays   down   that   whenever   it   appears   to   the   appropriate \r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment that land in any locality is needed or is likely to be needed for \r\n\r\n\r\nany   public   purpose   or   for   a   company,   then   a   notification   to   that   effect   is \r\n\r\n\r\nrequired to be published in the Official Gazette and two daily newspapers \r\n\r\n\r\nhaving   circulation   in   the   locality.     Of   these,   one   paper   has   to   be   in   the \r\n\r\n\r\nregional language.  A duty is also cast on the Collector, as defined in Section \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3(c), to cause public notice of the substance of such notification to be given \r\n\r\n\r\nat convenient places in the locality.  The last date of publication and giving \r\n\r\n\r\nof   public   notice   is   treated   as   the   date   of   publication   of   the   notification. \r\n\r\n\r\nSection   4(2)   lays   down   that   after   publication   of   the   notification   under \r\n\r\n\r\nSection   4(1),   any   officer   authorised   by   the  Government  in  this   behalf,   his \r\n\r\n\r\nservants or workmen can enter upon and survey and take levels of any land \r\n\r\n\r\nin   the   locality   or to   dig   or   bore   into   the   sub-soil   and   to   do   all   other   acts \r\n\r\n\r\nnecessary for ascertaining that land is suitable for the purpose of acquisition. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe   concerned  officer,  his   servants  or  workmen   can  fix   the  boundaries  of \r\n\r\n\r\nland   proposed   to   be   acquired   and   the   intended   line   of   the   work,   if   any, \r\n\r\n\r\nproposed to be made on it.  They can also mark such levels and boundaries \r\n\r\n\r\nby   marks   and   cutting   trenches   and   cut   down   and   clear   any   part   of   any \r\n\r\n\r\nstanding crops, fence or jungle for the purpose of completing the survey and \r\n\r\n\r\ntaking level, marking of boundaries and line.   However, neither the officer \r\n\r\n\r\nnor his servants or workmen can, without the consent of the occupier, enter \r\n\r\n\r\ninto   any   building   or   upon   any   enclosed   court   or   garden   attached   to   a \r\n\r\n\r\ndwelling house without giving seven days\' notice to the occupier.     Section \r\n\r\n\r\n5A,  which   embodies  the  most   important  dimension  of  the  rules  of  natural \r\n\r\n\r\njustice,   lays   down   that   any   person   interested   in   any   land   notified   under \r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4(1) may, within 30 days of publication of the notification, submit \r\n\r\n\r\nobjection in writing against the proposed acquisition of land or of any land \r\n\r\n\r\nin the locality to the Collector.  The Collector is required to give the objector \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan opportunity of being heard either in person or by any person authorized \r\n\r\n\r\nby him or by pleader.  After hearing the objector (s) and making such further \r\n\r\n\r\ninquiry,   as   he   may   think   necessary,   the   Collector   has   to   make   a   report   in \r\n\r\n\r\nrespect of land notified under Section 4(1) with his recommendations on the \r\n\r\n\r\nobjections and forward the same to the Government along with the record of \r\n\r\n\r\nthe proceedings held by him.   The Collector can make  different reports in \r\n\r\n\r\nrespect of different parcels of land proposed to be acquired.  Upon receipt of \r\n\r\n\r\nthe Collector\'s report, the appropriate Government is required to take action \r\n\r\n\r\nunder Section 6(1) which lays down that after considering the report, if any, \r\n\r\n\r\nmade   under   Section   5-A   (2),   the   appropriate   Government   is   satisfied   that \r\n\r\n\r\nany particular land is needed for a public purpose, then a declaration to that \r\n\r\n\r\neffect   is   required   to   be   made   under   the   signatures   of   a   Secretary   to   the \r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment   or   of   some   officer   duly   authorised   to   certify   its   orders.   This \r\n\r\n\r\nsection also envisages making of different declarations from time to time in \r\n\r\n\r\nrespect of different parcels of land covered by the same notification issued \r\n\r\n\r\nunder   Section   5(1).     In   terms   of  clause   (ii)   of   proviso   to   Section   6(1),   no \r\n\r\n\r\ndeclaration in respect of any particular land covered by a notification issued \r\n\r\n\r\nunder   Section   4(1),   which   is   published   after   24.9.1989   can   be   made   after \r\n\r\n\r\nexpiry of one year from the date of publication of the notification.  To put it \r\n\r\n\r\ndifferently,  a declaration  is required  to be made  under Section  6(1) within \r\n\r\n\r\none year from the date of publication of the notification under Section 4(1). \r\n\r\n\r\nIn   terms   of   Section   6(2),   every   declaration   made   under   Section   6(1)   is \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrequired to be published in the official gazette and in two daily newspapers \r\n\r\n\r\nhaving circulation in the locality in which land proposed to be acquired is \r\n\r\n\r\nsituated.     Of   these,   at   least   one   must   be   in   the   regional   language.     The \r\n\r\n\r\nCollector   is   also   required   to   cause   public   notice   of   the   substance   of   such \r\n\r\n\r\ndeclaration to be given at convenient places in the locality.  The declaration \r\n\r\n\r\nto   be   published   under   Section   6(2)   must   contain   the   district   or   other \r\n\r\n\r\nterritorial   division   in   which   land   is   situate,   the   purpose   for   which   it   is \r\n\r\n\r\nneeded,   its   approximate   area   or  a   plan  is   made   in  respect   of   land  and   the \r\n\r\n\r\nplace where such plan can be inspected.   Section 6 (3) lays down that the \r\n\r\n\r\ndeclaration made under Section 6(1) shall be conclusive evidence of the fact \r\n\r\n\r\nthat land is needed for a public purpose. After publication of the declaration \r\n\r\n\r\nunder   Section   6,   the   Collector   is   required   to   take   order   from   the   State \r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment for the acquisition of land to be carved out and measured and \r\n\r\n\r\nplanned (Sections 7 and 8). The next stage as envisaged is issue of public \r\n\r\n\r\nnotice   and   individual   notice   to   the   persons   interested   in   land   to   file   their \r\n\r\n\r\nclaim for compensation. Section 11 envisages holding of an enquiry into the \r\n\r\n\r\nclaim and passing of an award by the Collector who is required to take into \r\n\r\n\r\nconsideration the provisions contained in Section 23. Section 16 lays down \r\n\r\n\r\nthat after making an award the Collector can take possession of land which \r\n\r\n\r\nshall thereafter  vest in the Government. Section  17(1) postulates taking of \r\n\r\n\r\npossession of land without making an award.  If the appropriate Government \r\n\r\n\r\ndecides   that   land   proposed   to   be   acquired   is   urgently   needed   for   a   public \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npurpose   then   it   can   authorise   the   competent   authority   to   take   possession. \r\n\r\n\r\nSection 17(2) contemplates a different type of urgency in which, the State \r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment   can   authorise   taking   of   possession   even   before   expiry   of   15 \r\n\r\n\r\ndays period specified in Section 9 (1).  Section 17(4) lays down that in cases \r\n\r\n\r\nwhere   appropriate   Government   comes   to   the   conclusion   that   there   is \r\n\r\n\r\nexistence   of   an   urgency   or   unforeseen   emergency,   it   can   direct   that \r\n\r\n\r\nprovisions of Section 5-A shall not apply.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n24.      Before   adverting   to   the   precedents   in   which   Section   5A   has   been \r\n\r\n\r\ninterpreted by this Court, it will be useful to notice development of the law \r\n\r\n\r\nrelating   to   the   rule   of   hearing.   In   the   celebrated   case   of  Cooper   v. \r\n\r\n\r\nWandsworth Board of Works (1863) 143 ER 414, the principle was stated \r\n\r\n\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n\r\n         \"Even God did not pass a sentence upon Adam, before he was \r\n\r\n         called upon to make his defence.  \"Adam\" says God, \"where art \r\n\r\n         thou?     hast   thou   not   eaten   of   the   tree   whereof   I   commanded \r\n\r\n         thee that thou shouldest not eat\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTherein   the   District   Board   had   brought   down   the   house   of   the   plaintiff\'s \r\n\r\n\r\n(Cooper),   because   he   had   failed   to   comply   with   The   Metropolis   Local \r\n\r\n\r\nManagement Act.   The Act required the plaintiff to notify the board seven \r\n\r\n\r\ndays before starting to build the house.  Cooper argued that even though the \r\n\r\n\r\nboard had the legal authority to tear his house down, no person should be \r\n\r\n\r\ndeprived of their property without notice.  In spite of no express words in the \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstatute the court recognized the right of hearing before the plaintiff\'s house \r\n\r\n\r\nbuilt without permission was demolished in the exercise of statutory powers. \r\n\r\n\r\nByles J stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               `Although there are not positive words in a statute \r\n\r\n               requiring   that   the   party   shall   be   heard,   yet   the \r\n\r\n               justice   of   the   common   law   shall   supply   the \r\n\r\n               omission of the legislature\'.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n25.    Perhaps the best known statement on the right to be heard has come \r\n\r\n\r\nfrom Lord Loreburn, L.C. in Board of Education v. Rice (1911 AC 179 at \r\n\r\n\r\n182), where he observed: \r\n\r\n\r\n       \"Comparatively   recent   statutes   have   extended,   if   they   have \r\n\r\n       originated, the practice of imposing upon departments or offices \r\n\r\n       of   State   the   duty   of   deciding   or   determining   questions   of \r\n\r\n       various kindsIn such cases they must act in good faith and \r\n\r\n       fairly listen to both sides, for that is a duty lying upon everyone \r\n\r\n       who   decides   anything.     But   I   do   not   think   they   are   bound   to \r\n\r\n       treat such questions as though it were a trial they can obtain \r\n\r\n       information   in   any   way   they   think   best,   always   giving   a   fair \r\n\r\n       opportunity   to   those   who   are   parties   in   the   controversy   for \r\n\r\n       correcting or contradicting any relevant statement prejudicial in \r\n\r\n       their view.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n26.    In  Ridge   v.   Baldwin  1964   AC   40   Lord   Reid   emphasized   on   the \r\n\r\n\r\nuniversality of the right to a fair hearing whether it concerns the property or \r\n\r\n\r\ntenure   of   an   office   or   membership   of   an   institution.     In  O\'Reilly   v. \r\n\r\n\r\nMackman 1983 2 AC 237, Lord Diplock said that the right of a man to be \r\n\r\n\r\ngiven   a   fair   opportunity   of   hearing,   what   is   alleged   against   him   and   of \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npresenting his own case is so fundamental to any civilized legal system that \r\n\r\n\r\nit is to be presumed that Parliament intended that failure to observe the same \r\n\r\n\r\nshould   render   null   and   void   any   decision   reached   in   breach   of   this \r\n\r\n\r\nrequirement.  In Lloyd v. Mcmahon 1987 AC 625 Lord Bridge said:\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"My   Lords,   the   so-called   rules   of   natural   justice   are   not \r\n\r\n        engraved  on tablets  of  stone.   To  use  the  phrase   which better \r\n\r\n        expresses   the   underlying   concept,   what   the   requirements   of \r\n\r\n        fairness   demand   when   any   body,   domestic,   administrative   or \r\n\r\n        judicial, has to make a decision which will affect the rights of \r\n\r\n        individuals   depends   on   the   character   of   the   decision-making \r\n\r\n        body, the kind of decision it has to make and the statutory or \r\n\r\n        other framework in which it operates. In particular, it is well-\r\n\r\n        established  that when a statute has conferred on any body the \r\n\r\n        power  to make   decisions  affecting  individuals,  the  courts  will \r\n\r\n        not  only  require   the   procedure  prescribed  by  the  statute  to  be \r\n\r\n        followed,   but   will   readily   imply   so   much   and   no   more   to   be \r\n\r\n        introduced  by way of additional procedural  safeguards  as will \r\n\r\n        ensure the attainment of fairness.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n27.     In the United States, principles of natural justice usually find support \r\n\r\n\r\nfrom the Due Process clause of the Constitution.  The extent of due process \r\n\r\n\r\nprotection   required   is   determined   by   a   number   of   factors;   first   the   private \r\n\r\n\r\ninterest   that   will   be   affected   by   the   official   action;   second,   the   risk   of   an \r\n\r\n\r\nerroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the \r\n\r\n\r\nprobable   value,   if   any,   of   additional   or   substitute   procedural   requirement \r\n\r\n\r\nwould entail.  \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n28.    The   amplitude,   ambit   and   width  of   the   rule   of  audi  alteram   partem \r\n\r\n\r\nwas lucidly stated by the three-Judge bench in  Sayeedur Rehman v. State \r\n\r\n\r\nof Bihar (1973) 3 SCC 333 in the following words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               \"11This   unwritten   right   of   hearing   is \r\n\r\n               fundamental   to   a   just   decision   by   any   authority   which \r\n\r\n               decides   a   controversial   issue   affecting   the   rights   of   the \r\n\r\n               rival contestants. This right has its roots in the notion of \r\n\r\n               fair   procedure.   It   draws   the   attention   of   the   party \r\n\r\n               concerned to the imperative necessity of not overlooking \r\n\r\n               the other side of the case before coming to its decision, \r\n\r\n               for   nothing   is   more   likely   to   conduce   to   just   and   right \r\n\r\n               decision   than   the   practice   of   giving   hearing   to   the \r\n\r\n               affected parties.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n29.    In  Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner  (1978) 1 \r\n\r\n\r\nSCC   405,   Krishna   Iyer   J.   speaking   for   himself,   Beg   CJ   and   Bhagwati   J. \r\n\r\n\r\nhighlighted the importance of rule of hearing in the following words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               \"43. Indeed, natural justice is a pervasive facet of secular \r\n\r\n               law   where   a   spiritual   touch   enlivens   legislation, \r\n\r\n               administration and adjudication, to make fairness a creed \r\n\r\n               of life. It has, many colours and shades, many forms and \r\n\r\n               shapes   and,   save   where   valid   law   excludes   it,   applies \r\n\r\n               when   people   are   affected   by   acts   of   authority.   It   is   the \r\n\r\n               hone   of   healthy   government,   recognised   from   earliest \r\n\r\n               times   and   not   a   mystic   testament   of   Judge-made   law. \r\n\r\n               Indeed,   from   the   legendary   days   of   Adam   --   and   of \r\n\r\n               Kautilya\'s  Arthasastra  --   the   rule   of   law   has   had   this \r\n\r\n               stamp of natural justice which makes it social justice. We \r\n\r\n               need   not   go   into   these   deeps   for   the   present   except   to \r\n\r\n               indicate that the roots of natural justice and its foliage are \r\n\r\n               noble and not new-fangled. Today its application must be \r\n\r\n               sustained by current legislation, case-law or other extant \r\n\r\n               principle, not the hoary chords of legend and history. Our \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               jurisprudence has sanctioned its prevalence even like the \r\n\r\n               Anglo-American system.\r\n\r\n                                                                  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n               48.  Once we understand the soul of the rule as fair play \r\n\r\n               in action -- and it is so -- we must hold that it extends to \r\n\r\n               both   the   fields.   After   all,   administrative   power   in   a \r\n\r\n               democratic set-up is not allergic to fairness in action and \r\n\r\n               discretionary   executive   justice   cannot   degenerate   into \r\n\r\n          The High Court was justified in non-suiting the appellants on the ground that they had not raised a specific plea supported by a proper affidavit to question the decision taken by the State Government to invoke Section 17(1) and 17(4) of the Act. There was not any valid ground or justification for invoking the urgency provision contained in Section 17(1) and to exclude the application of Section 5A for the acquisition of land for planned industrial development of the district. The acquisition is primarily meant to cater private interest in the name of industrial development of the district. No evidence has been produced before the Court to show that the State Government and/or agencies/instrumentalities of the State are intending to establish industrial units on the acquired land either by itself or through its agencies/instrumentalities. The Supreme Court observed that even if planned industrial development of the district is treated as public purpose within the meaning of Section 4, there was no urgency which could justify the exercise of power by the State Government under Section 17(1) and 17(4). The private entrepreneurs, who are desirous of making investment in the State, take their own time in setting up the industrial units. Therefore, time required for ensuring compliance of the provisions contained in Section 5-A cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be portrayed as delay which will frustrate the purpose of acquisition and it was held that there was no real and substantive urgency to justify invoking of the urgency provision under Section 17(1) and to exclude the application of Section 5-A. The order of the High Court set aside. The respondents are directed to proceed from the stage of Section 4 notification and take appropriate action after complying with Section 5-A(1) and (2) of the Act. The appeal was allowed. Appeals Allowed','Daya Shankar Vs State Of M.P Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.\n\n\n\n1.    Leave granted.\n\n\n\n2.    Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a Division Bench of the\n\nMadhya Pradesh High Court upholding the conviction of the appellant for\n\noffence punishable under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the Indian\n\nPenal Code, 1860 (in short the `IPC&apos;) as was awarded by learned Additional\n\nSessions Judge, Panna, in Sessions Trial No.15/1992.\n3.    Prosecution version as unfolded during trial is as follows:\n\n\n\n      On 30th November, 1991 at about 5.00 p.m. Ram Kishore (hereinafter\n\nreferred to as the `deceased&apos;) was murdered in an agricultural field. First\n\nInformation Report was lodged by Manik Lal at Police Station, Pawal in the\n\nevening at about 7.00 p.m. Offence was registered as Crime No.124/91\n\nunder Section 302/34 IPC. Deceased had eloped with Lalli, sister of\n\nRamcharan (A-2) and both of them had performed court marriage. The court\n\nmarriage was registered and Lalli was living with Ramkishore. The\n\nappellant was having enmity with deceased on account of aforesaid\n\nincident. Deceased after eloping with Lalli was living in some other village\n\nand returned to his village a month before the incident. Ramkishore had\n\ngone to answer the call of nature in the evening on 30.11.1991 at about 4.30\n\np.m. towards the agricultural field of Gadka. Around 5 p.m. Phulla (A-3)\n\narmed with axe, Ramcharan (A-2) armed with sword alongwith\n\nDayashankar (A-1) and Munni Lal (A-4) went to the field of Gadaka. Munni\n\nLal and Dayashankar were barehanded. Phulla gave axe blow on the head of\n\ndeceased. Thereafter, Dayashankar and Munnilal, the co-accused pulled the\n\nlegs of deceased and threw him on the ground. Ram Kishore fell on the\n\n\n\n \ncrops in the field. Ramcharan assaulted the deceased by sword on the chest.\n\nThen he placed his sword on the chest of the deceased. On account of\n\nbeating he died. Police after receiving information of the commission of\n\ncrime carried out the investigation, arrested the accused persons and filed\n\nthe challan on 3.1.1992 before the Court of Judicial Magistrate. Case was\n\ncommitted to the Court of Sessions Judge. Trial Court framed charges under\n\nSection 302/34 IPC against the accused persons. After recording the\n\nevidence the trial Court convicted the accused persons for offence under\n\nSections 302 read with Section 34 IPC and sentenced them as afore-noted.\n\n\n\n      Before the High Court the basic stand was that the prosecution failed\n\nto prove common intention on the part of the appellants and, therefore,\n\nSection 34 had no application. The individual act of the appellant should\n\nhave been considered. Merely because the appellant had accompanied other\n\naccused persons, that cannot be sufficient to warrant presumption of\n\ncommon intention.\n\n\n\n4.    Learned counsel for the State submitted that the eye witnesses PWs 2\n\nand 3 had described the act of each of the appellants and the role ascribed to\n\nthe appellant was that he pulled the leg of the deceased as a result of which\n\n\n\n \ndeceased fell in the field of Masur crop and thereafter he was assaulted by\n\nother accused persons. The appeal was dismissed accepting the stand of the\n\nState.\n\n\n\n5.       Learned counsel for the appellant re-iterated the stand taken before\n\nthe High Court and submitted that Section 34 IPC has no application.\n\n\n\n6.       Learned counsel for the State on the other hand supported the\n\njudgment.\n\n\n\n7.       Section 34 has been enacted on the principle of joint liability in the\n\ndoing of a criminal act. The Section is only a rule of evidence and does not\n\ncreate a substantive offence. The distinctive feature of the Section is the\n\neleme Indian Penal Code, 1860 - Section 302/34 - Murder- - Conviction and sentence- - Whether calls for obstruction?- - Held, \"yes\"- - Evidence of observers did not credit any clear demonstration to litigant - Mere truth that he was in organization of blamed who were equipped - Not adequate to draw in Section 34- - Appellant not outfitted - He had no ill will with expired - Stand that he pulled leg of perished - Not built up - Not suitable to hold appealing party blameworthy by utilization of Section 34- - His conviction put aside.

Krishnamurthy and R. Gopdlakrishnan, for the appellant.\nH.   R.	 Gokhale,  B.  Subbiah	and  R.	 Thiagaraian,	for,\nrespondents Nos. 2 and 4.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRamaswami,  J. The plaintiff G. Narayana Raju filed O.S.  34\nof  1951-52  in	 the Court of  District	 Judge,	 Mysore	 for\npartition   and	 separate  possession  of  suit	  properties\nmentioned in the various schedules of the plaint.  The first\ndefendant is the brother\n \nof  the	 plaintiff.  The second defendant is  the  widow  of\nMuniswami  Raju, the eldest brother of the  plaintiff.	 The\nthird	defendant  is  the  legal  representative   of	 the\nplaintiffs  mother.  She is now the, appellant	having	been\nbrought	 on  record  as	 the  legal  representative  of	 the\ndeceased  plaintiff. The case of the original plaintiff	 was\nthat he, the first defendant and Muniswami Raju (husband  of\nthe  second defendant) were the sons of one Gopala Raju	 and\nwere all members of the joint family Gopalaraju died in	 May\n1931  and  after his death the plaintiff  and  his  brothers\ncontinued  to  be members of the joint	family.	  The  joint\nstatus	of  the,  family  was severed  by  the	issue  of  a\nregistered notice by the first defendant to the plaintiff in\nJuly 1951.  An ancestral house in Nazar bad belonging to the\nfamily was acquired by the City IuprovementTrust Board in or\nabout the year 1909.  Out of the compensation paid for	that\nhouse and supplemented by the earnings of the members of the\njoint  family, the house item No. I of Schedule &apos;A&apos;  to	 the\nplaint	was  purchased by Gopalaraju in or  about  the	year\n1910.	Subsequently  item No. 2 of Schedule  &apos;A&apos;  was	also\npurchased by Gopalaraju from the income of item No. I supple\nmented	by the earnings of the members of the  family.	 All\nthe other items of properties mentioned in Schedule &apos;A&apos;	 and\nother Schedules attached to the plaint were acquired out  of\nthe  income  from  items 1 and 2 of  Schedule  &apos;A&apos;,  It	 was\nfurther	 alleged that the business known as \"Ambika  Stores\"\nwas  also the joint family business and all  the  properties\nmentioned in the Schedules except items I and 2 of  Schedule\n&apos;A&apos;  were acquired out of the income of the members  of	 the\nfamily	including  the income from the	business  of  Ambika\nStores.	  The plaintiff accordingly claimed that he and	 the\nfirst defendant would each be entitled to get 5/14ths  share\nand  the second and third defendants would each be  entitled\nto  get	 2/14ths. share.  In the alternative  the  plaintiff\npleaded	 that  if  for any reason the Court  held  that	 the\nproperties stand in the name of Muniswami Raju and were	 not\nacquired with the aidof the joint familv nucleus, he and the\nsecond defendant were entitled to equal shares as  co-owners\nof the joint family business.  The suit was mainly contested\nby  the	 second defendant who asserted that  the  properties\nmentioned  in  all the Schedules of the	 plaint	 were  self-\nacquisitions of Miiniswami Raju and constituted his separate\nproperties.  It was alleged that Muniswami Raju was the only\ncarniiig member of the family at the time of the acquisition\nof items 1 and 2 of Schedule operties and the plaintiff	 and\nthe  first defendant were emploved,in petty jobs  in  Wesley\nPress.	 Muniswami Raju later on employed the  plaintiff  in\nhis  -shop  as	a salaried servant and	the  latter  had  no\nproprietary  right in the business of Ambika Stores.   After\nconsideration  of  the	oral and  documentary  evidence	 the\nDistrict Judge held that the plaintiff, first defendant	 and\nMuniswami  Raju were not divided and that the only  property\nwhich was divisible was item No. I of Schedule\n \n&apos;A&apos;  and  there	 was not sufficient  ancestral	nucleus	 for\nacquisition of the other properties and that all  properties\nexcept item No. 1 of Schedule &apos;A were the self	acquisitions\nof  Muniswami Raju, that Muniswami I Raju never blended	 his\nproperties with that of the joint family that the  plaintiff\nwas  only an employee under Muniswami Raju and therefore  he\nwas not entitled to the alternativ &apos; relief claimed by	him.\nAccordingly, the District Judge granted a preliminary decree\nholding	 that the plaintiff was entitled to 2/7ths share  in\nitem  No. I of Schedule &apos;A&apos;.  The plaintiff took the  matter\nin  appeal to the Mysore High Court.  By its judgment  dated\nMarch  25,  1960 the High Court affirmed the decree  of	 the\ntrial court with the modification that besides item No. I of\nSchedule  &apos;A&apos;  item No. 2 also should be hold  to  be  joint\nfamily property and the plaintiff was entitled to  partition\nof  his share in this item also.  The High  Court  cancelled\nthe  I	direction of the District Judge that  the  plaintiff\nshould	account for the moneys and properties  of  Muniswami\nRaju  -in  his hands before he is given	 possession  of	 his\nshare.\nThis  appeal  is  brought by certificate on  behalf  of	 the\nplaintiff  from the judgment of the Mysore High Court  dated\nMarch 25, 1960 in R.A. No. 155 of 1953.\nThe  first  question  to be considered	in  this  appeal  is\nwhether	 the  business	of  Ambika  Stores  was	 really	 the\nbusiness  of the joint family and whether the plaintiff	 was\nentitled. to a partition of his share in the assets of	that\nbusiness.: It was contended on behalf of the appellant	that\nthe  business of Ambika Stores grew out of a nucleus of	 the\njoint family funds of at least by the efforts of the members\nof  the joint family include the appellant.  The  contention\nof the appellant has been negatived by both the lower courts\nand there is a concurrent finding that the Ambika Stores was\nthe  separate business of Muniswami Raju and it was  neither\nthe  joint  family  business nor  treated  as  joint  family\nbusiness, It is wellestablished that there is no presumption\nunder Hindu law that a business standing in the name of	 any\nmember	of the joint family is a joint family business	even\nif that member is the manager, of the joint family.  Unless,\nit  could  be shown that the business in the  hands  of	 the\ncoparcener  grew up with the assistance of the joint  family\nproperty  or joint family funds or that the earnings of	 the\nbusiness  were	blended with the joint	family	estate,	 the\nbusiness remains free and separate.  The question  therefore\nwhether	 the  business	was begun or  carried  on  with	 the\nassistance of joint family property or joint family funds or\nas  a  -family	business is a  question	 of  fact.-(See	 the\ndecisions of the Judicial Committee in Bhwu Mal v. Jagannath\n(1)  and in Pearey Lal v. Nanak Chand (1) and of this  Court\nin Chattahatha Karayalar v. Ramachandra\n(1)   A.T.R 1943 P.C 40.\n(2)   A.T.R. 1948 P.C  108.\n \nlyer)  (1).   In  the present, case there  is  a  concurrent\nfinding of both the lower courts that the business of Ambika\nStores	was a separate, business of Muniswami Raju  and	 it,\nwas  neither  a joint family business nor treated  as  joint\nfamily business.  The concurrent finding of the lower courts\non  this issue is upon a finding of fact and  following	 the\nusual practice of this Court, it is not now open to  further\nscrutiny by this Court under Art. 133 of the Constitution.\nIt  was, however, contended on behalf of the appellant	that\nthe finding of the lower. courts is vitiated in, law because\nof  the circumstance that they have not taken  into  account\nthree important documents, Ex.	D, Ex.	E and Ex.  DDD.	  We\nare  unable  to	 accept this argument  as  correct.   It  is\nmanifest on a perusal of the judgment of the High Court that\nall  the documents have been examined, regarding  the  issue\nwhether	 the  business of Ambika Stores was a  joint  family\nbusiness  or whether it was p. separate, business  of  Muni-\nswami  Raju.  As regards Ex.  D, the High-,Court has,  after\nexamining the evidence adduced, remarked that the, mere fact\nthat  item No. 2 of Schedule &apos;A was given as a	security  by\nMuniswami Raju did not result in any detriment to the  joint\nfamily	property and, it cannot therefore be held  that	 the\nbusiness of Ambika Stores grew out of the joint family funds\nor with the aid of the joint family funds.  On behalf of the\nappellant  reliance was placed on the recitals in Ex.  E,  a\ndeed of mortgage dated July 26, 1928 executed by Gopalaraju,\nMuniswamiraju  and  the appellant in favour  of	 the  Mysore\nBank.	The  property  that had been  mortgaged	 under	this\ndocument is item No. 2 of Schedule &apos;A&apos;.	 The recital is that\nthe  borrowing from the Bank was for the business and  trade\nof  the	 executants and -for the benefit and  use  of  their\nfamily.	  There is also a recital in an earlier	 portion  of\nthe document that the business, was being carried on for the\nbenefit	 of  the  family, but it is not quite  clear  as  to\nwhether this related to the business carried on by  Narayana\nRaju  or whether it was intended to relate to some  business\ncarried on by all the three executants.	 It is possible that\nthe  appellant had other business of his own carried on	 -on\nhis own. account at that time and it cannot be, assumed that\nthe borrowing under Ex.	 E must have been for the purpose of\nAmbika	Stores.	 It should be noticed that  Muniswarni	Raju\nhas  been  described in the document as	 the  proprietor  of\nAmbika Stores which description is. not consistent with	 the\ncontention  of the appellant that the business, was a  joint\nfamily	business.  The High Court has, in  this	 connection,\nreferred  to Ex.  I an application dated February 14,  1929,\nby  the	 appellant  to the City	 Co-operative  Bank,  Mysore\nwherein, the appellant has said that he was getting a decent\nearning	 by  doing;  out-of-door  commercial  business	with\nAmbika	Stores.	 There is also the, recital in Ex.   I	that\nMuniswami Raju was the proprietor of Ambika Stores.   Having\nregard to this recital in I it is not-\n(1)  A.I.R. 1955 S.C. 799.\n \nunlikely that the appellant had some business of his own  at\nthe  material time and it cannot be assumed  that  borrowing\nunder Ex.  E, was for the purpose of Ambika Stores  business\nonly.  The High Court has also dealt with the effect of	 Ex.\nDDD, mortgage deed produced on behalf of the appellant.	  It\nis  true that in this document the appellant  and  Muniswami\nRaju  have been described as proprietors of  Ambika  Stores.\nThe finding of the High Court is that this recital was	made\nin the document for the purposes of borrowing from the Bank.\nReference was made in this context to a letter dated May  5,\n1931,  Ex.  75 written by Muniswami Raju  as  proprietor  of\nAmbika	Stores to the Bank of Mysore.  In&apos; this	 letter,  he\nhas requested the Bank to take note of the fact that he	 has\nauthorised the appellant to accept drafts, and sign  letters\netc. on behalf of the firm&apos; There is another Letter, Ex. 76,\ndated  April 14, 1934 written by Muniswami Raju to the	Bank\nof  Mysore wherein Muniswami Raju has been described as	 the\nproprietor  of Ambika Stores and there is an  intimation  to\nthe Bank, that the appellant Narayana Raju was authorised to\nsign  for the firm.  In the context and background of  these\ncircumstances  it is evident that though both the  appellant\nand  Muniswami Raju were described as proprietors of  Ambika\nStores the description was only for the purpose of borrowing\nmoney  from the Bank, as contended for by  the	respondents.\nIn  this  connection  the High Court  has  also	 taken	into\naccount Ex. 7 5 (b), a letter written by Muniswami Raju.  In\nthis  letter  Muniswami Raju has described  himself  as	 the\nproprietor of Ambika Stores and has instructed the Bank that\nhe   The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Ramaswami, J. The plaintiff G. Narayana Raju filed O.S. 34 of 1951-52 in the Court of District Judge, Mysore for partition and separate possession of suit properties mentioned in the various schedules of the plaint. The first defendant is the brother of the plaintiff. The second defendant is the widow of Muniswami Raju, the eldest brother of the plaintiff. The third defendant is the legal representative of the plaintiffs mother. She is now the, appellant having been brought on record as the legal representative of the deceased plaintiff. The case of the original plaintiff was that he, the first defendant and Muniswami Raju (husband of the second defendant) were the sons of one Gopala Raju and were all members of the joint family Gopalaraju died in May 1931 and after his death the plaintiff and his brothers continued to be members of the joint family. The joint status of the, family was severed by the issue of a registered notice by the first defendant to the plaintiff in July 1951. An ancestral house in Nazar bad belonging to the family was acquired by the City IuprovementTrust Board in or about the year 1909. Out of the compensation paid for that house and supplemented by the earnings of the members of the joint family, the house item No. I of Schedule \'A\' to the plaint was purchased by Gopalaraju in or about the year 1910. Subsequently item No. 2 of Schedule \'A\' was also purchased by Gopalaraju from the income of item No. I supple mented by the earnings of the members of the family. All the other items of properties mentioned in Schedule \'A\' and other Schedules attached to the plaint were acquired out of the income from items 1 and 2 of Schedule \'A\', It was further alleged that the business known as \"Ambika Stores\" was also the joint family business and all the properties mentioned in the Schedules except items I and 2 of Schedule \'A\' were acquired out of the income of the members of the family including the income from the business of Ambika Stores. The plaintiff accordingly claimed that he and the first defendant would each be entitled to get 5/14ths share and the second and third defendants would each be entitled to get 2/14ths. share. In the alternative the plaintiff pleaded that if for any reason the Court held that the properties stand in the name of Muniswami Raju and were not acquired with the aidof the joint familv nucleus, he and the second defendant were entitled to equal shares as co-owners of the joint family business. The suit was mainly contested by the second defendant who asserted that the properties mentioned in all the Schedules of the plaint were self- acquisitions of Miiniswami Raju and constituted his separate properties. It was alleged that Muniswami Raju was the only carniiig member of the family at the time of the acquisition of items 1 and 2 of Schedule operties and the plaintiff and the first defendant were emploved,in petty jobs in Wesley Press. Muniswami Raju later on employed the plaintiff in his -shop as a salaried servant and the latter had no proprietary right in the business of Ambika Stores. After consideration of the oral and documentary evidence the District Judge held that the plaintiff, first defendant and Muniswami Raju were not divided and that the only property which was divisible was item No. I of Schedule \'A\' and there was not sufficient ancestral nucleus for acquisition of the other properties and that all properties except item No. 1 of Schedule \'A were the self acquisitions of Muniswami Raju, that Muniswami I Raju never blended his properties with that of the joint family that the plaintiff was only an employee under Muniswami Raju and therefore he was not entitled to the alternativ \' relief claimed by him. Accordingly, the District Judge granted a preliminary decree holding that the plaintiff was entitled to 2/7ths share in item No. I of Schedule \'A\'. The plaintiff took the matter in appeal to the Mysore High Court. By its judgment dated March 25, 1960 the High Court affirmed the decree of the trial court with the modification that besides item No. I of Schedule \'A\' item No. 2 also should be hold to be joint family property and the plaintiff was entitled to partition of his share in this item also. The High Court cancelled the I direction of the District Judge that the plaintiff should account for the moneys and properties of Muniswami Raju -in his hands before he is given possession of his share.\r\n\r\n\r\nheld:  the appellant during Muniswami Raju\'s life-time of his being a co-owner of the partnership business, nor is there any evidence of recognition by Muniswami Raju of any such right of the appellant. On the other hand, there is sufficient evidence to show that whatever the appellant did in connection with the business was only done with the Authority conferd by Muniswami Raju. In our opinion the High Court has rightly rejected the claim of the appellant that he was a co-owner of the partnership business.\r\n\r\ncourt  the reason expressed we hold that this appeal has no merit and it must be dismissed with costs.\r\n\r\n Appeal was dismissed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ','Rathnavathi & Anr Vs Kavita Ganashamdas Abhay Manohar Sapre, J.\r\n\r\n1.    Leave granted.\r\n\r\n2.    The plaintiff  filed  two  suits,  one  for  specific  performance  of\r\nagreement and other for grant of permanent injunction  in  relation  to  the\r\nsuit  house.  The  trial  court  vide  common  judgment  and  decree   dated\r\n16.10.2001 dismissed both the suits. The first appellate  court,  i.e.,  the\r\nHigh Court, in appeal, by impugned  judgment  and  decree  dated  08.09.2011\r\nreversed the judgment and decree of the trial court  and  decreed  both  the\r\nsuits in appeal, against the defendants.  Being aggrieved  by  the  judgment\r\nand decree of the High Court, Defendants 1 and 3 have approached this  Court\r\nin the instant civil appeals.\r\n3.    The question arises for consideration in these appeals is whether  the\r\nHigh Court was justified in allowing the  first  appeals  preferred  by  the\r\nplaintiff, resulting in decreeing the two civil suits against defendants  in\r\nrelation to suit house?\r\n4.    In order to appreciate the controversy involved in  the  civil  suits,\r\nand now in these appeals, it is necessary to state the relevant facts.\r\n5.    For the sake of convenience, description of parties  herein  is  taken\r\nfrom Original Suit No.223/2000.\r\n6.    Defendant no.2 is the original owner of the suit house  and  defendant\r\nno.1 is the subsequent purchaser of the suit house from defendant no.2.\r\n7.    The dispute relates to a dwelling house bearing no. 351  Block  no.11,\r\nMatadahalli Extension,  now  known  as  R.T.  Nagar  Bangalore  (hereinafter\r\nreferred to as \" the suit house    ).\r\n8.    The suit house  was  purchased  by  defendant  no.  2  from  Bangalore\r\nDevelopment  Authority  (in  short     BDA   )  in  a  scheme.   On  15.02.1989,\r\nDefendant no. 2 entered into an agreement (Annexure-P-1) with plaintiff  for\r\nsale of suit house at a total consideration of Rs. 3,50,000/-. In  terms  of\r\nclause 2 of the agreement, the plaintiff paid  a  sum  of  Rs.  50,000/-  as\r\nadvance towards sale consideration. These facts are not in dispute.\r\n9.    On  07.01.2000,  the  plaintiff  filed  a  civil  suit  being  OS  No.\r\n223/2000, initially against 3 defendants for  seeking  permanent  injunction\r\nrestraining  the  defendants  jointly  and  severally  from  interfering  in\r\nplaintiff\'s possession over the  suit  house.  In  substance,  case  of  the\r\nplaintiff was  that  she  entered  into  an  agreement  on  15.02.1989  with\r\ndefendant no. 2 to purchase the suit house for Rs.  3,50,000/-  and  paid  a\r\nsum of Rs. 50,000/- to defendant no. 2 by way of advance  towards  the  sale\r\nconsideration. Later, the plaintiff further paid the  balance  consideration\r\nof Rs. 3 Lacs towards the sale price  and  obtained  receipts  acknowledging\r\nthe payment so made. It was  alleged  that  the  plaintiff  was  accordingly\r\nplaced in actual physical possession of the suit house and  since  then  she\r\nhas been in possession of the suit house. It was alleged that she also  made\r\nsome improvements therein by spending money and is  paying  electricity  and\r\nwater charges etc. It was further alleged that the  plaintiff  was  and  has\r\nalways been ready and willing to perform her part of the  agreement  to  get\r\nthe sale deed executed in her favour after having performed her part of  the\r\ncontract. However, defendant no. 2, for the reasons best known to  her,  did\r\nnot  execute  the  sale  deed  despite  having  received   the   full   sale\r\nconsideration from the plaintiff. It was alleged that defendant no.  1,  who\r\nis a total stranger to the  suit  house  and  having  no  right,  title  and\r\ninterest in the suit house, on 2.1.2000 visited the suit  house  along  with\r\ndefendant no.  2  and  some  other  unwanted  elements  and  threatened  the\r\nplaintiff to dispossess her from the suit house. It was  also  alleged  that\r\non 8.1.2000, defendant nos. 1 and 2 again visited and attempted  to  assault\r\nthe plaintiff and unsuccessfully attempted to commit trespass  in  the  suit\r\nhouse.\r\n10.   On seeing the hostile attitude of defendant nos. 1  and  2  and  their\r\nassociates, the plaintiff immediately lodged a complaint  in  the  concerned\r\npolice station. Since police authorities did not take any action, which  was\r\nrequired of, the plaintiff filed the  aforesaid  civil  suit  for  permanent\r\ninjunction restraining the  defendants  from  interfering  in  her  peaceful\r\npossession over the suit house. It was submitted that the  plaintiff  has  a\r\nprima facie case, so also the balance of convenience  and  irreparable  loss\r\nin her favour, which entitles her to claim permanent injunction against  the\r\ndefendants in relation to the suit house. The plaintiff  also  averred  that\r\nshe reserved her right to file a suit for specific performance of  agreement\r\nagainst the defendants.\r\n11.   The aforesaid suit was contested by defendant nos.  1  and  2.   While\r\nadmitting the ownership of defendant no. 2 over the suit house and the  fact\r\nof entering into an agreement  with  the  plaintiff  for  its  sale  to  the\r\nplaintiff and further while admitting the receipt of advance payment  of  Rs\r\n50,000/- from the plaintiff, the defendants denied all material  allegations\r\nmade in the plaint. It was alleged  that  the  plaintiff  did  not  pay  the\r\nbalance consideration as alleged. It was also alleged that defendant  no.  2\r\non 25.10.1995 cancelled the agreement dt 15.02.1989 by sending legal  notice\r\nto the plaintiff and then  sold  the  suit  house  to  defendant  no.  1  on\r\n09.02.1998 for Rs. 4 lacs and placed her in its possession.\r\n12.   On 31.03.2000, the plaintiff filed another civil  suit  being  OS  No.\r\n2334 of 2000 in  the  Court  of  City  Civil  Judge  Bangalore  against  the\r\ndefendants  for  specific  performance  of  agreement  dated  15.02.1989  in\r\nrelation to the suit house.\r\n13.   After pleading the same facts, which are set out above, the  plaintiff\r\nfurther alleged that she has performed her part of the agreement  by  paying\r\nentire sale consideration of Rs. 3,50,000/- and has been  in  possession  of\r\nthe suit house. It was alleged that  on  the  one  hand,  defendant  no.  2,\r\ndespite having received full sale consideration, did not  perform  her  part\r\nof the agreement by not getting the suit house  transferred  in  plaintiff\'s\r\nfavour as per clause 3 of the agreement and by doing the acts which she  was\r\nexpected to do in terms of agreement,  and  on  the  other  hand,  tried  to\r\ninterfere in plaintiff\'s lawful possession over the suit house.\r\n14.   This led the plaintiff to serve upon defendant  no.2  a  legal  notice\r\ndated 6.3.2000 thereby calling upon defendant no.2 to execute the sale  deed\r\nin relation to suit property in plaintiff\'s favour.  Since  despite  service\r\nof legal notice, defendant no. 2  failed  to  execute  the  same,  suit  for\r\nspecific performance was also filed. The plaintiff then by way of  amendment\r\nalso sought to add one prayer for cancellation of sale deed alleged to  have\r\nbeen executed by defendant  no.  2  in  favour  of  defendant  no.  1.  This\r\namendment was allowed.\r\n15.    The  defendants  contested  the  civil  suit.  While  admitting   the\r\nexecution of agreement dated 15.02.1989 with the plaintiff for sale of  suit\r\nhouse for Rs. 3,50,000/- and also admitting payment of Rs. 50,000/-  by  the\r\nplaintiff to defendant no. 2,  the  defendants  denied  all  other  material\r\nallegations and inter alia alleged that since the plaintiff  failed  to  pay\r\nthe balance sale consideration of Rs. 3 lacs to defendant no. 2 in terms  of\r\nthe agreement, defendant no. 2 on 25.10.1995 sent  a  legal  notice  to  the\r\nplaintiff cancelling the agreement dated 15.2.1989 and sold the  suit  house\r\nto defendant no. 1  on  09.02.1998  for  consideration  and  placed  her  in\r\npossession of the suit house. The defendants  also  alleged  that  defendant\r\nno. 1 was the bona fide purchaser for value and hence her  title  cannot  be\r\nquestioned in the suit.\r\n16.   The defendants also contested the suit on two legal grounds.  Firstly,\r\nit was contended that the suit was not maintainable, as  the  bar  contained\r\nin Order II Rule 2 of Code of Civil Procedure,  1908  (hereinafter  referred\r\nto as \'CPC\') did not permit the plaintiff to  file  the  suit  for  specific\r\nperformance of agreement in question against the defendants. It was  alleged\r\nthat relief to claim specific performance of agreement was available to  the\r\nplaintiff when she filed the first suit  (OS  No.  223/2000)  for  permanent\r\ninjunction against the defendants. Yet, the plaintiff failed  to  claim  the\r\nrelief in the first suit, consequently,  the  second  suit  filed  to  claim\r\nspecific performance of agreement in question is hit by rigor  contained  in\r\nOrder II Rule 2 of CPC. It is now barred and hence liable  to  be  dismissed\r\nas not maintainable. Secondly, it was contended that the suit  is  otherwise\r\nbarred by limitation having been filed beyond  the  period  of  three  years\r\nfrom the date of accrual of cause of action as provided  in  Article  54  of\r\nthe Limitation Act, 1963. It was, therefore,  contended  that  the  suit  is\r\nliable to be dismissed as being barred by limitation, as well.\r\n17.   The trial court consolidated both the suits  for  trial.  Issues  were\r\nframed. Parties adduced  evidence.  The  trial  court  vide  judgment/decree\r\ndated 25.8.2009 though  answered  some  issues  in  plaintiff\'s  favour  but\r\neventually dismissed the civil suits. It was held that the  agreement  dated\r\n15.02.1989 was executed between the plaintiff and defendant no. 2  for  sale\r\nof suit house; that the plaintiff was  not  placed  in  possession  of  suit\r\nhouse pursuant to agreement in question; that the plaintiff  was  not  ready\r\nand willing to perform her part of the agreement; that  suit  is  barred  by\r\nlimitation; that the plaintiff was not entitled  to  claim  the  relief  for\r\nspecific performance of agreement; that the plaintiff was  not  entitled  to\r\nclaim the relief for grant of permanent injunction; that defendant no. 1  is\r\na bona fide purchaser of the suit house for value;  that the  plaintiff  was\r\nnot entitled to challenge the sale deed dt. 9.2.1998, that the suit was  hit\r\nby the bar contained in Order II Rule 2 of CPC  because  the  plaintiff  did\r\nnot obtain leave to file second suit for specific performance  while  filing\r\nthe first suit for grant of permanent injunction against the  defendants  in\r\nrelation to the suit house.\r\n18.   Feeling aggrieved, the  plaintiff  filed  two  regular  first  appeals\r\nbeing R.F.A. Nos. 1092 of 2009 and 1094 of 2009 before the  High  Court.  By\r\ncommon impugned judgment/decree, the High Court allowed  both  the  appeals,\r\nreversed the judgment/decree of the trial court and decreed both  the  civil\r\nsuits by passing a decree for specific performance of agreement against  the\r\ndefendants in relation to suit house and also  issued  permanent  injunction\r\nas claimed by the plaintiff. The High Court answered all the  aforementioned\r\nissues in plaintiff\'s favour and against the defendants.\r\n19.   The High Court  in  its  judgment  held  that  the  plaintiff  was  in\r\npossession of suit house; that the  plaintiff  performed  her  part  of  the\r\nagreement; that the plaintiff paid the  entire  sale  consideration  of  Rs.\r\n3,50,000/- to defendant no. 2; that the plaintiff was ready and  willing  to\r\nperform her part of agreement; that defendant no. 2 failed  to  perform  her\r\npart of the agreement thereby rendering her liable to perform  her  part  of\r\nagreement; and that subsequent sale even if  made  by  defendant  no.  2  in\r\nfavour of defendant no. 1 was not binding on the plaintiff  because  it  was\r\nnot bona fide.\r\n20.   The High Court, however, after deciding the issues in  favour  of  the\r\nplaintiff, directed that in order to weigh the equities between the  parties\r\nand keeping in view the price escalation, which is  unavoidable  in  present\r\ndays, the plaintiff will pay an additional sum of Rs. 4 lacs over and  above\r\nRs. 3,50,000/- to defendant no. 2 for obtaining sale deed in her favour.\r\n\r\n 21.  It is against this judgment/decree of the High Court,  the  defendants\r\nhave filed the present appeals by way of special leave petitions.\r\n22.   Mrs. Nalini Chidambaram, learned  Senior  Counsel  appearing  for  the\r\nappellants (defendants) while assailing the legality and correctness of  the\r\nimpugned judgment urged various submissions. Firstly, she  argued  that  the\r\nHigh Court erred in allowing plaintiff\'s  first  appeals,  as  according  to\r\nher, both the appeals were liable to be dismissed by upholding the  judgment\r\n/decree of the trial court which had rightly dismissed the suits.  Secondly,\r\nshe argued that second suit filed for claiming specific performance  of  the\r\nagreement for sale of suit house to the plaintiff was hit by  bar  contained\r\nin Order II Rule 2 of CPC for  the  reason  that  the  plaintiff  failed  to\r\nsecure leave in her first suit and  hence  the  second  suit  filed  by  the\r\nplaintiff for grant of specific performance was not  maintainable.  Thirdly,\r\nshe argued that assuming the second suit was held  maintainable,  even  then\r\nit was barred by limitation prescribed in Article 54 of the Limitation  Act.\r\nIt was  pointed  out  that  cause  of  action  to  file  suit  for  specific\r\nperformance of contract against  the  defendants  arose  in  the  year  1989\r\nitself no sooner 60 days period  expired  from  the  date  of  agreement  as\r\nprovided in clause 2  of  the  agreement,  whereas,  the  suit  in  question\r\nseeking specific performance was filed  in  year  2000  and  hence,  it  was\r\nhopelessly  barred  applying  the  limitation  prescribed  in  Article   54.\r\nFourthly, it was argued that in any case, there was  no  case  made  out  on\r\nevidence by the plaintiff for reversal of the findings relating to grant  of\r\nspecific performance of agreement because the plaintiff  was  neither  ready\r\nnor willing to perform her part of the  agreement  and  nor  there  was  any\r\nevidence to hold in her favour on this material issue. Fifthly,  she  argued\r\nthat there was no evidence to hold that the plaintiff was in  possession  of\r\nthe suit house; rather there was enough evidence to hold that after sale  of\r\nsuit house by defendant no.2 to defendant no.1, it was defendant  no.1,  who\r\nwas in possession. Therefore, it should have been held  that  the  plaintiff\r\nwas not in possession of the suit house, as was rightly held  by  the  trial\r\ncourt. And, lastly she argued that it should have been held with the aid  of\r\nevidence that defendant no. 1 was bona fide purchaser of the suit house  for\r\nvalue, as she purchased it after the owner i.e. defendant  no.  2  cancelled\r\nthe agreement dt 15.2.1989 and then sold the suit house to defendant no.  1.\r\n\r\n23.   After arguing  at  length  with  reference  to  documents  on  record,\r\nlearned counsel for the appellants contended that impugned judgment  /decree\r\ndeserves to be set aside  and  that  of  the  trial  court  be  restored  by\r\ndismissing both the suits filed  by  the  plaintiff.  Learned  counsel  also\r\nrelied upon certain decisions, which we shall refer later.\r\n24.   Mr. P. Vishwanatha Shetty, learned senior counsel for  the  respondent\r\n(plaintiff) supported the impugned judgment /decree and  contended  that  it\r\ndoes not call for any interference. According  to  learned  senior  counsel,\r\nall the findings recorded by the High Court, though of reversal, deserve  to\r\nbe upheld because the High Court, in exercise of its first appellate  powers\r\nunder Section 96 of CPC, rightly appreciated the evidence and  came  to  its\r\nindependent conclusion which it could legally do and which  it  rightly  did\r\nwhile allowing the two first appeals.  Learned  senior  counsel  urged  that\r\nthis Court  while  hearing  these  appeals  cannot  and  rather  should  not\r\nundertake the exercise of appreciating the whole evidence  again  like  that\r\nof the first appeal except to find out whether there is any  apparent  legal\r\nerror in the impugned judgment so as to call for any  interference  by  this\r\nCourt. Learned senior counsel submitted that no such  error  exists  in  the\r\nimpugned judgment and hence these appeals are liable to be dismissed.\r\n25.   Having heard the learned counsel for the parties at  length  and  upon\r\nperusal of the record of the case, we find no merit in these appeals  as  in\r\nour considered opinion, the submissions urged by the learned senior  counsel\r\nfor the appellants, though argued ably, have no force.\r\n26.   Coming first to the legal question as  to  whether  bar  contained  in\r\nOrder II Rule 2 of CPC is attracted so as to non- suit  the  plaintiff  from\r\nfiling  the  suit  for  specific  performance  of  the  agreement,  in   our\r\nconsidered opinion, the bar is not attracted\r\n27.   At the outset, we consider it apposite to take note of law  laid  down\r\nby the Constitution bench of this Court in Gurbux Singh  v.  Bhooralal,  AIR\r\n1964 SC 1810, wherein this Court while explaining the true  scope  of  Order\r\nII Rule  2  of  CPC  laid  down  the  parameters  as  to  how  and  in  what\r\ncircumstances, a plea should be  invoked  against  the  plaintiff.   Justice\r\nAyyangar speaking for the Bench held as under:\r\n   In order that a plea of a  bar  under  Order  2  Rule  2(3)  of  the  Civil\r\nProcedure Code should succeed the defendant who raises the  plea  must  make\r\nout (1) that the second suit was in respect of the same cause of  action  as\r\nthat on which the previous suit was based;  (2)  that  in  respect  of  that\r\ncause of action the plaintiff was entitled to more than one relief;  (3)that\r\nbeing thus entitled to more than one relief  the  plaintiff,  without  leave\r\nobtained from the Court omitted to sue for the relief for which  the  second\r\nsuit had been filed. From this analysis it would be seen that the  defendant\r\nwould have to establish primarily and to start with, the  precise  cause  of\r\naction upon which the previous suit was filed, for unless there is  identity\r\nbetween the cause of action on which the earlier suit was filed and that  on\r\nwhich the claim in the later suit is based there would be no scope  for  the\r\napplication of the bar      \r\n                                   (Emphasis supplied)\r\n\r\n28.   This Court has consistently followed the aforesaid enunciation of  law\r\nin later years and reference to only one of such recent decisions  in  Virgo\r\nIndustries (Eng.) P. Ltd. Vs Venturetech Solutions P.  Ltd.,  (2013)  1  SCC\r\n625, would suffice, wherein this Court reiterated the principle  of  law  in\r\nfollowing words:\r\n   The cardinal requirement for application of  the  provisions  contained  in\r\nOrder II Rules 2(2) and (3), therefore, is that the cause of action  in  the\r\nlater suit must be the same  as  in  the  first  suit.  It  will  be  wholly\r\nunnecessary to enter into any discourse on the  true  meaning  of  the  said\r\nexpression, i.e. cause  of  action,  particularly,  in  view  of  the  clear\r\nenunciation in a recent judgment of this  Court  in  the  Church  of  Christ\r\nCharitable Trust and Educational  Charitable  Society,  represented  by  its\r\nChairman   v.   Ponniamman   Educational   Trust    represented    by    its\r\nChairperson/Managing Trustee  JT  2012  (6)  SC  149.  The  huge  number  of\r\nopinions  rendered  on  the  issue  including  the  judicial  pronouncements\r\navailable does not fundamentally detract from what is stated  in  Halsbury\'s\r\nLaws of England, (4th Edition). The following reference from the above  work\r\nwould, therefore, be apt for being extracted herein below:\r\n\r\n       Cause of Action    has been defined as meaning simply a  factual  situation\r\nexistence of which entitles one person to obtain from  the  Court  a  remedy\r\nagainst another person. The phrase has been held from the earliest  time  to\r\ninclude every fact which is material to be proved to entitle  the  Plaintiff\r\nto succeed, and  every  fact  which  a  Defendant  would  have  a  right  to\r\ntraverse. \'Cause of action    has also been  taken  to  mean  that  particular\r\naction on the part of the Defendant which gives the Plaintiff his  cause  of\r\ncomplaint, or the subject-matter  of  grievance  founding  the  action,  not\r\nmerely the technical cause of action.   \r\n\r\n29.   In the instant case when we apply  the  aforementioned  principle,  we\r\nfind that bar contained in Order II Rule 2 is not attracted because  of  the\r\ndistinction in the cause of action for filing the two suits. So far  as  the\r\nsuit for permanent injunction is concerned, it was based on a  threat  given\r\nto the plaintiff by the defendants to dispossess her from the suit house  on\r\n2.1.2000 and 9.1.2000. This would be clear  from  reading  Para  17  of  the\r\nplaint. So far as cause of action to file suit for specific  performance  of\r\nagreement is concerned, the same was based on non performance  of  agreement\r\ndated 15.2.1989 by defendant no. 2  in  plaintiff\'s  favour  despite  giving\r\nlegal notice dated 6.3.2000 to defendant no. 2 to perform her part.\r\n30.   In our considered opinion, both the suits were, therefore, founded  on\r\ndifferent causes of action and hence could be filed  simultaneously.  Indeed\r\neven  the  ingredients  to  file  the  suit  for  permanent  injunction  are\r\ndifferent than that of the suit for specific performance of agreement\r\n31.   In case of former, plaintiff is required to make out the existence  of\r\nprima facie case, balance of convenience and irreparable loss likely  to  be\r\nsuffered by the plaintiff on facts with reference to the  suit  property  as\r\nprovided in Section 38 of the Specific  Relief  Act,  1963  (in  short     the\r\nAct   ) read with Order 39 Rule 1 &amp; 2 of CPC. Whereas, in case of  the  later,\r\nplaintiff is required to  plead  and  prove  her  continuous  readiness  and\r\nwillingness to perform her part of  agreement  and  to  further  prove  that\r\ndefendant failed to perform her  part  of  the  agreement  as  contained  in\r\nSection 16 of The Act.\r\n32.   One of the basic requirements for successfully invoking  the  plea  of\r\nOrder II Rule 2 of CPC is that the defendant of  the  second  suit  must  be\r\nable to show that the second suit was also in respect of the same  cause  of\r\naction as that on which the previous suit was based.\r\n33.   As mentioned supra, since in the case on hand, this basic  requirement\r\nin relation to cause of action is not made out, the  defendants  (appellants\r\nherein) are not entitled to raise a plea of bar contained in Order  II  Rule\r\n2 of CPC to successfully non suit the plaintiff from  prosecuting  her  suit\r\nfor specific performance of the agreement against the defendants.\r\n 34.  Indeed when the cause of action to claim the respective  reliefs  were\r\ndifferent so also the ingredients for  claiming  the  reliefs,  we  fail  to\r\nappreciate as to how a plea of Order II  Rule  2  could  be  allowed  to  be\r\nraised by the defendants and how it was sustainable on such facts.\r\n 35.  We cannot accept the submission of  learned  senior  counsel  for  the\r\nappellants when she contended that  since  both  the  suits  were  based  on\r\nidentical pleadings and when cause of action to sue for relief  of  specific\r\nperformance of agreement was available to the plaintiff prior to  filing  of\r\nthe first suit, the second suit was hit by bar contained in Order II Rule  2\r\nof CPC.\r\n36.   The submission has a fallacy for two basic reasons. Firstly,  as  held\r\nabove, cause of action in two suits being different,  a  suit  for  specific\r\nperformance could not have been instituted on the basis of cause  of  action\r\nof the first The question arises for consideration in these appeals is whether the High Court was justified in allowing the first appeals preferred by the plaintiff, resulting in decreeing the two civil suits against defendants in relation to suit house?- In order to appreciate the controversy involved in the civil suits, and now in these appeals, it was necessary to state the relevant facts- The dispute relates to a dwelling house -The suit house was purchased by defendant no. 2 from Bangalore Development Authority (in short BDA) in a scheme- Defendant no. 2 entered into an agreement with plaintiff for sale of suit house at a total consideration of Rs. 3,50,000/-- In terms of clause 2 of the agreement, the plaintiff paid a sum of Rs. 50,000/- as advance towards sale consideration-These facts are not in dispute- the plaintiff filed a civil suit being For injuction-Though this litigation was not between inter se owner and subsequent purchaser of the suit house yet in order to do substantial justice between the parties and to see the end of this long litigation and to prevent a fresh suit being instituted by defendant no.1 against defendant no.2 for refund of sale consideration which will again take years to decide and lastly when neither it involve any intricate adjudication of facts, nor it is going to cause any prejudice to the parties, we consider it just and proper to invoke our power under Article 142 of the Constitution of India in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case as narrated above and accordingly direct defendant no. 2 (owner of the suit house) to refund Rs. 4 lacs to defendant no. 1 within three months after execution of sale deed by them in favour of plaintiff pursuant to the impugned judgment/decree- failure to refund the amount within three months, would carry interest at the rate of 9% payable on the unpaid amount from the date of this order till recovery and defendant no. 1, in the event of non-payment by defendant no. 2, would be entitled to levy execution against defendant no. 2 for realization of outstanding money along with interest as awarded treating this order to be a decree in appropriate executing court in accordance with law- Held- These appeals were accordingly disposed of-  No costs. Disposed off','Ranjana Vs State Of Maharashtra &amp; Ors      This appeal arises out of the judgment and order, dated 28th\n\nNovember, 2002, in Writ Petition No. 5058 of 2002, delivered by a\n\nDivision Bench of the High Court of Judicature of Bombay at\n\nAurangabad. By the impugned order, the High Court has dismissed\n\nappellant&apos;s petition questioning the correctness of the orders passed\n\nby the Caste Scrutiny Committee, which had invalidated the claim of\n\nthe appellant as belonging to the \"Mahar\" caste, finally resulting in\n\nher disqualification as a Member of the Zilla Parishad, Aurangabad.\n\n     In order to appreciate the issue, requiring determination, a few\n\nmaterial facts may be stated:\n\n     The appellant was born on 29th May, 1976 to Namdeo Nathaiji\n\nBagul and Zalabai Bagul, a farmer \"Mahar\" family. On 22nd April,\n1996, she married Babasaheb Nana Sature, a resident of Village\n\nJategaon according to \"Boudh\" rites.\n\n     In January, 2002, elections to the Zilla Parishad, Aurangabad\n\nwere announced and in the said election, the Constituency of\n\n&apos;10-Mahalgaon Circle&apos; was reserved for a Scheduled Caste citizen.\n\nOn 31st January, 2002, the appellant approached the Sub-Divisional\n\nOfficer, Vaijapur and obtained a Caste Certificate declaring that she\n\nbelonged to \"Mahar\" caste, a listed Scheduled Caste in the\n\nConstitution (Schedule Castes) Order, 1950 for the State of\n\nMaharashtra. On the basis of her Caste Certificate, the appellant\n\nfiled the nomination form as a candidate of the Shiv Sena Party to\n\ncontest for the 10-Mahalgaon Circle Seat. On 18th February, 2002,\n\nthe appellant was declared elected.\n\n     On 5th March, 2002, a complaint was lodged before the District\n\nCollector, Aurangabad by Smt. Kavita Anna Bagul, one of the\n\ndefeated candidates, alleging that the appellant was disqualified to\n\ncontest the elections as a Scheduled Caste candidate because she\n\nwas born in a Christian family and professed Christianity. On 14th\n\nMarch, 2002, another complaint on the same lines was filed by\n\nRamesh Khandagale, General Secretary, Republican Party of India.\n\n     The Collector     referred   appellant&apos;s   caste   certificate   for\n\nvalidation to the Caste Scrutiny Committee (\"the Committee\", for\n\n\n\n \nshort), which in turn got a vigilance inquiry conducted. After the\n\nsubmission of the vigilance report, the appellant filed her defence\n\nstatement. To substantiate their respective claims before the\n\nCommittee,    the   appellant   and   the   complainants    adduced\n\ndocumentary and oral evidence. The Committee by a majority view\n\nof 2 : 1, vide its order dated 25th October, 2002/18th November, 2002\n\nreturned the finding that though the appellant was born in a \"Mahar\"\n\ncaste, but her family professed Christianity inasmuch as the\n\nappellant was baptized on 27th October, 1977, when she was one\n\nyear old; she was married in a Christian family and her contention\n\nthat she had embraced Buddhism on 23rd August, 1988 was not\n\nestablished. Thus, her claim that she belonged to \"Mahar\" caste (a\n\nScheduled Caste) was rejected.\n\n     Aggrieved by the order of the Committee, the appellant\n\npreferred a writ petition in the High Court, challenging the\n\ncorrectness of the findings of the Committee. It was pleaded on\n\nbehalf of the appellant that she was born in a \"Hindu Mahar\" family;\n\nher school record shows that she was a Hindu; later on she\n\nembraced Buddhism on 23rd August, 1988; there was no Baptism\n\nceremony on 27th October, 1977 and that her marriage as also of\n\nher brothers and sisters were solemnised as per Boudh traditions.\n\n\n\n\n \n     Tracing the origin of \"Mahars\", one of the socially backward\n\nclasses in Rural Maharashtra, the High Court noted the factum of\n\nlarge scale conversions of socially backward classes in the rural\n\nareas of Maharashtra to Christianity. The High Court also noticed\n\nthe amendment carried out in the Constitution (Scheduled Castes)\n\nOrder, 1950, by the Act No.15 of 1999, whereby and whereunder\n\nthe persons who had converted themselves to \"Buddhism\" were\n\nheld eligible for the benefit of reservation as available to the\n\nScheduled Castes from 1999 onwards. Taking into consideration the\n\nevidence on record, including the entries in the Baptism Register,\n\nthe High Court observed thus:\n\n     \"Reading the Baptism register and the entries thereof in\n     respect of the petitioner on 27.10.1977, with the\n     provisions of Canon Law as reproduced hereinabove, we\n     have no doubt in our mind that the petitioner&apos;s parents\n     professed Christianity when the petitioner was baptised at\n     the age of one year and she was born to Christian\n     parents. It is obvious that the petitioner&apos;s parents continue\n     with their caste identity namely \"Mahar caste\" but that by\n     itself would not be sufficient to hold that the petitioner did\n     not Profess Christianity and she was all along a \"Mahar\n     Hindu / Buddhist\".\n\n     In so far as the stand of the appellant that she had embraced\n\nBuddhism on her marriage is concerned, the High Court observed\n\nas under:\n\n           \"It appears that the petitioner was aware of the legal\n     position, namely: on reconversion to Buddhism or\n     Hinduism she can enter into the fold of Scheduled Castes\n     and she took the plea regarding her reconversion to\n\n \n     Buddhism. In support of this defence, she relied on the\n     certificate purportedly issued by Bhadant. This Dhamma\n     Dhiksha Certificate is purportedly dated 23.8.2002 by the\n     said Bhadant. The Committee had issued a notice calling\n     upon the said person to appear before it. In spite of receipt\n     of the notice, the said Bhadant did not appear before the\n     Committee on 30.8.2002. T  Civil  - Validity of Order - Dismissal of Appellant\'s request of scrutinizing the accuracy of the requests go by the Caste Scrutiny Committee, which had negated the claim of the Appellant as having a place with the \"Mahar\" position - Hence Appeal \r\n\r\nHeld, Finding of the Committee that the Appellant is not a Scheduled Caste, being basically a finding of actuality, it is not a fit case for exercise of ward under Article 136 of the Constitution - Though the High Court has found the section with respect to Appellant\'s Baptism to have been made in the typical course of Baptism, however the passage does not fundamentally demonstrate the way that her folks had likewise changed over to Christianity - Matter remanded [para 12, 14] ','Noor Salman Makani Vs Union Of India (Jayachandra The Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nK.  JAYACHANDRA REDDY, J.- Leave granted in SLP	 (Crl.)	 No.\n1484 of 1993.\n2.   In	 both  these  matters, Noor  Salman  Makani  who  is\ndetained  under Section 3 of the COFEPOSA Act,	1974  (&apos;Act&apos;\nfor  short) is the petitioner.	The petitioner is a  citizen\nof  India.   On	 August	 26, 1992  he  was  travelling	from\nCalcutta  to Hong Kong by Thai International Airways  Flight\nNo. TC314.  After completing the immigration formalities, he\napproached  the Customs counter for clearance.	The  Customs\nauthorities   opened  his  briefcase  and   recovered	huge\nquantities  of	foreign exchange of various  countries,	 the\nvalue of which is estimated at Rs 38,06,930.  On August	 27,\n1992  he was produced under arrest before the  CJM,  Barasat\nand his application for bail was rejected.  On September 19,\n1992 an order of detention dated September\n \n18,  1992  was	served on him in the  jail  along  with	 the\ngrounds	 of  detention.	 On October 1,	1992  a	 declaration\nunder  Section 9(1) of the Act was issued and the  same	 was\nserved	on the detenu on October 13, 1992.  On	October	 15,\n1992  the  petitioner made a representation to	the  Central\nGovernment   against  the  declaration	but  the  same	 was\nrejected.   On	December  28, 1992  the	 petitioner  made  a\nrepresentation	before the Advisory Board but that was	also\nrejected.  Thereafter he filed a writ of habeas corpus and a\nDivision  Bench	 of the Calcutta High  Court  dismissed	 the\nsame.	As against the said order the present SLP  in  which\nleave is granted, has been filed.  A separate Writ  Petition\n(Crl.)	No.  261 of 1993 questioning the  declaration  under\nSection	 9(1)  of the Act has also been filed  stating	that\ncertain	 new facts have come to light which  invalidate	 the\ndeclaration.   The  detention  order is	 questioned  on	 the\nground	 that	there	was   delay   in   considering	 the\nrepresentation	and  also on the ground that  the  detaining\nauthority has not duly considered the circumstance that	 the\ndetenu	was  already  in jail and has  simply  made  a	bald\nstatement in the grounds stating that \"there is	 possibility\nof  the	 detenu being released on bail\" and the	 same  shows\nthat there is non-application of mind.\n3.   From the records it appears that the representation  of\nthe  detenu addressed to the Joint Secretary, COFEPOSA,	 New\nDelhi was forwarded by Dum Dum Central Jail authority  under\nregistered  post on October 15, 1992 and it was received  by\nthe  Ministry&apos;s	 Office	 on  October 22,  1992	and  it	 was\nforwarded  to  the Sponsoring Unit on October 23,  1992	 who\nreceived  it on October 26, 1992.  After  offering  parawise\ncomments  the same was sent by speed post to the  Ministry&apos;s\nOffice	on  October  29,  1992 which  was  received  by	 the\nMinistry&apos;s  Office on November 2, 1992.	 The  representation\nwas  put up before the Joint Secretary on November  3,	1992\nand the same was rejected on November 4, 1992.	The  Finance\nSecretary recommended the rejection of the representation on\nNovember  5,  1992  and finally	 the  Minister	for  Finance\nrejected the same on the same day and a memo dated  November\n6,  1992 was issued to the petitioner intimating  him  about\nthe rejection.\n4.   Learned  counsel appearing for the	 petitioner  submits\nthat the delay between October 15, 1992 and November 2, 1992\nhas  not  been satisfactorily explained and hence  is  fatal\nbeing violative of Article 22(5) of the Constitution.  It is\nalso  his submission that the delay of every day has  to  be\nexplained  as held by the courts.  He relied on some of	 the\njudgments of this Court including Rama Dhondu Borade v. V.K.\nSaraf,	Commissioner of Police&apos;.  There is no doubt that  in\nmany  cases  this Court has reiterated that  the  right	 and\nobligation to make and to consider the representation at the\nearliest  opportunity is a constitutional  imperative  which\ncannot	be curtailed or abridged but in considering  whether\nthere  was  undue and unexplained delay, the facts  in	each\ncase have to be examined.  In Rama Dhondu Borade case&apos;	this\nCourt observed thus: (SCC p. 180, para 20)\n	      \"True,  there is no prescribed  period  either\n	      under  the provisions of the  Constitution  or\n	      under the concerned detention law within which\n	      the\n	      1	 (1989) 3 SCC 173: 1989 SCC (Cri)  520:	 AIR\n	      1989 SC 1861\n \n	      representation should be dealt with.  The	 use\n	      of the words &apos;as soon as may be&apos; occurring  in\n	      Article  22(5)  of the  Constitution  reflects\n	      that    the    representation    should	  be\n	      expeditiously considered and disposed of	with\n	      due promptitude and diligence and with a sense\n	      of urgency and without avoidable delay.	What\n	      is  reasonable dispatch depends on  the  facts\n	      and circumstances of each case and no hard and\n	      fast  rule  can be laid down in  that  regard.\n	      However,	in case the gap between the  receipt\n	      of the representation and its consideration by\n	      the authority is so unreasonably long and	 the\n	      explanation  offered  by the authority  is  so\n	      unsatisfactory,  such delay could vitiate	 the\n	      order of detention.\"\nIn  the above case the gap between receipt and	disposal  of\nthe representation was 28 days but up to the date of service\nof the order of rejection, the delay amounted to 32 days and\nthe court was not satisfied with the explanation offered and\nit was only after a delay of 14 days that the representation\nwas disposed of and the only explanation was that some	more\ninformation  was  called  for and that	there  were  certain\nholidays  in  between.	The Court held that  the  delay	 was\nunreasonable   and  the	 explanation   was   unsatisfactory.\nRelying	 on these observations, the learned counsel  submits\nthat in the instant case the period between October 15, 1992\nand  October  22,  1992 and between  October  23,  1992	 and\nNovember  2, 1992 amounted to undue and	 unexplained  delay.\nBut  if	 we  examine  the facts it  can	 be  seen  that	 the\nrepresentation	was forwarded by the Jail Superintendent  on\nOctober	 15,  1992 itself by registered post  but  that	 was\nreceived  on October 22, 1992 by the Ministry&apos;s	 Office	 and\nthe  entire delay was due to the delay in  postal  delivery.\nTherefore  the	same cannot be said to be  unreasonable	 and\nunexplained.

','Sunil Vs State Of Maharashtra Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.\n\n\n\n1.      Leave granted.\n\n2.      Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a Division Bench of the\n\nBombay High Court, Aurangabad Bench dismissing the appeals filed by\n\nseveral accused persons. The present appeal is by original accused No. 6\n\n\n\n\n \n(hereinafter referred to as the A6). He was convicted for various offences\n\npunishable under the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short the `IPC&apos;) and\n\nsentenced to undergo custodial imprisonment and fine with default\n\nstipulation. The High Court dismissed the appeal so far as the present\n\nappellant is concerned, we are not concerned with the other appeals.\n\n\n\n3.    Prosecution version in a nutshell is as follows:\n\n\n\n      A.S.I. Yadav Satpute(P.W. 11) who was attached to police station,\n\nPathardi and was on duty as a Police Station officer on 7.3.1998, received a\n\nphone call at about 2230 hrs. informing him that there was stone pelting at\n\nRangar Galli and, therefore, he sent the necessary police force. He made an\n\nentry at sr. no. 30 in the station diary and at about 10.45 p.m. sent a message\n\nto the Control Room and the other police stations. An entry in this behalf\n\nwas recorded in the station diary at sr. no. 32. Sanjay Shahane (P.W. 4)\n\ncame to the police station and A.S.I. Satpute (P.W. 11) recorded the report\n\nof&apos; Sanjay (P.W. 4) at Exh. 125. An entry in this behalf was accordingly\n\nmade in the station diary at sr. no.33. Sanjay Shahane (P.W. 4) immediately\n\nleft the police station on receiving message that his uncle Jaikumar (P.W. 2)\n\n\n\n\n \nhad become unconscious. Thereafter at about 2355 hrs., original accused\n\nNo.13 Pratibha came to the police station and gave a report in respect of a\n\nnon-cognizable offence. An entry in respect thereof was made in the station\n\ndiary at sr. no. 34. Original accused No.10 Amol and juvenile offender\n\nRama were referred to the hospital as they had sustained minor injuries. The\n\nXerox copy of the entries in the station diary are Exh. 156. A.P.I. Shinde\n\n(P.W. 12) who was also attached to Police Station, Pathardi took over the\n\ninvestigation of Crime No.33 of 1998 from A.S.I. P.W. 11 Satpute as the\n\ncrime had been registered on the basis of the first information report of\n\nSanjay Shahane (P.W.4). A.P.I. Shinde (P.W. 12) received a copy of the\n\nstatement of Digambar (P.W. 1). On 8.3.1998, A.P.I. Shinde accordingly\n\nvisited the mortuary and drew the inquest panchnama of the dead bodies of\n\nDhananjay and Santosh vide inquest panchnamas at Exhs. 116 and 117 in\n\nthe presence of witnesses. Thereafter on the same day he visited the scene of\n\nthe offence at about 9.30 A.M. and drew the scene of the offence\n\npanchnama at Exh. 111 in the presence of P.W. 1 Digambar. The scene of\n\nthe offence was pointed out by P.W. 4 Sanjay Shahane and the spot is a\n\nnarrow lane to the south of the main road of Pathardi. The narrow lane\n\nwhich is the scene of the offence is known as Rangar Galli. Deceased\n\n\n\n\n \nDhananjay had been killed in front of the house of one Pandurang Kasar\n\nwhile deceased Sanjay had been killed in front of the house of one\n\nBhagirath Bajaj. The lane was of a width of about 4 ft. with stone flooring.\n\nDried bloodstains were noticed in front of the house of Bhagirath Bajaj as\n\nwell as in front of the house of Pandurang Kasar. The distance between the\n\ntwo spots where the murder of deceased Sanjay and deceased Dhananjay\n\nhad been committed is at about 10 ft. The spot panchnama further records\n\nthat at a distance of 25 ft. house of one Vilas Rodi is situated and an electric\n\nbulb is affixed on the door of his house.

','Bhagwan Singh &amp; Ors Vs State Of M.P SETHI, J.\n\n	The appellants, alongwith two others, were charged under Sections 148, 302, 336, 337, 427 read\nwith Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code by the Court of Additional Sessions Judge, Burhanpur and after\ntrial acquitted by the trial court vide its judgment dated 24th June, 1987.  The appeal filed by the State\nagainst the order of acquittal was allowed by the High Court vide the judgment impugned convicting the\nappellants for offences under Section 302/149 and sentencing them to life imprisonment besides paying a\nfine of Rs.5,000/- each in default of which they have been directed to suffer further rigorous imprisonment\nfor one year each.  They were also convicted for the commission of offence under Section 148 IPC and\nsentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year each.\n\n	Not satisfied with the judgment of the High Court, the appellants have preferred this appeal under\nSection 379 of the Code of Criminal Procedure read with Order XXI Rules 12 to 29 of the Supreme Court\nRules, 1966.\n\n	According to the prosecution there was a dispute between Amarnath (deceased) and Ram Singh,\nappellant with respect to four mango trees grown on Khasra No.212 situated at Village Sarai.  Litigation\nwas pending between both the parties and police had registered several cases under Sections 147 and 145 of\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure.	 According to the FIR recorded on the statement of PW22 Jagdish that he\nalong with his family members was watching TV at his house.  Amarnath and Hari Ram were also there.\nWhen he was about to start his meals, they heard the cries of \"Bachao-Bachao\" (save-save) raised by\nSurender.  They saw all the 16 accused persons assaulting Surender with lathis, Dhariya, Khartaliya and\nPata.  When Hari Ram went to intervene, the accused attacked him.  Similarly when Amarnath went\nforward he was also assaulted.	Ram Singh instigated other accused persons to finish Amarnath saying that\nas he was responsible for everything, he should be finished today.  Thereafter Ram Singh, Bhagwan Singh,\nSardar Singh, Roop Singh and Dhyansingh attacked Amarnath with lethal weapons in their possession.\nWitness rushed forward to save his father and was also attacked by the aforesaid accused persons.  He ran\naway to the house to save himself.  The accused then threw stones on the house which broke roof tiles,\ndoors and also damaged the walls.  After registration of the FIR, the investigating officers sent the injured,\nnamely, Surender and Hari Ram to the District Hospital, Khandwa where they died the same night, the\ninformation of which was sent to the police by Hospital Authorities.  Mukesh was also found injured and\nsent for treatment to the hospital.  In the occurrence three persons, namely, Surender, Hari Ram and\nAmarnath were murdered and some of the witnesses injured.\n\n	The trial court acquitted the accused persons on finding that appellants Bhagwan Singh, Ram\nSingh, Roop Singh had received injuries and \"seeing danger of life and other accused utilised right of\nprivate defence and there aggressors died and rest aggressors fled away.  Hence the act of the accused fall\nwithin the definition of right of private defence u/s 100 IPC and their act is not punishable according to\nprovisions of section 96 IPC\".	The trial court further held, \"I find that prosecution failed to prove case\nbeyond reasonable doubts and accused committed murder of deceased Amarnath, Surender and Hariram\nand caused injuries to Mukesh witness and damaged house of Jagdish after throwing stones\". Holding that\nthe prosecution had failed to prove the offence against accused beyond all reasonable doubts and giving\nthem the benefit of right of self-defence, as contemplated under Section 100 IPC, he acquitted the accused\npersons.\n\n	The High Court rightly found that the trial court had been led astray by the simple fact that the\ninjuries on the person of the accused had not been explained by the prosecution witnesses.  After referring\nto number of judgments of this Court, the High Court concluded:\n\n\"In view of what we have discussed about the circumstances\nof the case, the injuries on the persons of the three\ndeceased, the sequence in which the witnesses reached the\nspot of crime, minor nature of the injuries on the persons\nof the accused except one injury on the head of Bhagwan\nSingh and the background and also the sequence in which the\ndeceased were attacked, rules out any possibility of the\naccused having attacked the three deceased in exercise of\nself-defence of any of them.  It is clear that the accused\npersons were the aggressors.\"\n\n\n	After critically and minutely examining the evidence on record,\nthe High Court found that the presence of eye-witnesses, namely, Kiran\n(PW7), Mukesh (PW12) and Jagdish (PW22) cannot be doubted.  In this\nregard the court held:\n\n\"A striking feature of this case is that one of the accused\nSardarsingh lodged a report Ex.D-5 at 11.30 p.m. that 4\npersons i.e. Amarnath, Jagdish, Surendra and Hariram were\nassaulting Bhagwansingh and Roopsingh.	Even here Jagdish\nwitness was shown present and there was no mention of\nRamsingh accused.  Then in cross examination to these three\neye-witnesses the suggestions have been that the deceased\nand the witnesses along with others assaulted the accused at\nthe house of Ramsingh.	The trial court has ignored this\ntrend of cross examination on behalf of the accused in\nappreciating whether the witnesses were present at the scene\nof violence.  In the facts and circumstances of a given\ncase, the trend of cross-examination by defence or\nprosecution witness can provide support to the inference if\nsome accused and witnesses were present at the scene of\ncrime.	The most striking feature is the fact that such a\nreport was recorded by the police and they at one proceeded\nto the scene of crime.	There is no mention in Ex.D-5 if any\nserious injury was given to Sardarsingh or Roopsing and\nwhether any weapon has been used or only fists blows were\nbeing exchanged.  Still the police rushed to the scene of\ncrime at the night.  This is rare.  This indicates that\nthere was some under current working between the police and\nthe accused persons.  The police could not but have recorded\nthe Dehati Nalishi on finding one person died and 2 in the\nprocess of dying with fatal injuries.  This is followed by\nlapse of the investigating officer in recorded statement of\nMukesh and Kiran after 7 days if Kiran had not witnesses the\noccurrence there was no need to introduce her as a witness\nwhen there were witnesses such as Jagdish and Mukesh whose\npresence at that spot could hardly be challenged.  So, if\nanything, investigation was unfair towards the complainant\nparty and not against the accused persons.\"\n\nand concluded:\n\n\"So we find the testimony of these witnesses, trustworthy\nand also confirmatory to each other.  Their presence is\nestablished at the scene of crime.  Their testimony is\ncorroborated by FIR and by medical evidence.\"\n\n	We do not agree with the submissions of the learned counsel for\nthe appellants that under Section 378 of the Code of Criminal Procedure\nthe High Court could not disturb the finding of facts of the trial court\neven if it found that the view taken by the trial court was not proper.\nOn the basis of the pronouncements of this Court, the settled position\nof law regarding the powers of the High Court in an appeal against an\norder of acquittal is that the Court has full powers to review the\nevidence upon which an order of acquittal is based and generally it will\nnot interfere with the order of acquittal because by passing an order of\nacquittal the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused is\nreinforced.  The golden thread which runs through the web of\nadministration of justice in criminal case is that if two views are\npossible on the evidence adduced in the case, one pointing to the guilt\nof the accused and the other to his innocence, the view which is\nfavourable to the accused should be adopted.  Such is not a jurisdiction\nlimitation on the appellate court but a Judge made guidelines for\ncircumspection.	 The paramount consideration of the court is to ensure\nthat miscarriage of justice is avoided.	 A miscarriage of justice which\nmay arise from the acquittal of guilty is no less than from the\nconviction of an innocent.  In a case where the trial court has taken a\nview ignoring the admissible evidence, a duty is cast upon the High\nCourt to reappreciate the evidence in acquittal appeal for the purposes\nof ascertaining as to whether all or any of the accused has committed\nany offence or not.  Probable view taken by the trial court which may\nnot be disturbed in the appeal is such a view which is based upon legal\nand admissible evidence.  In the instant case the trial court acquitted\nthe respondents by not re Code of Criminal Procedure - area 379 - Supreme Court Rules - Order XXI Rules 12 to 29 - advance under - Indian Penal Code - Sections 148, 302, 336, 337, 427 read with Section 149 - offenses under - conviction and sentence under the settled position of law in regards to the forces of the High Court in an interest against a request of quittance is that the court has full powers to survey the proof whereupon a request or vindication is based and for the most part it won\'t meddle with the request of absolution in light of the fact that by passing a request of exoneration the assumption guiltlessness for the denounced is strengthened - for a situation where the trial court has taken a view overlooking the allowable confirmation, an obligation is provided reason to feel ambiguous about the High Court to reappreciate the proof in quittance advance for the motivations behind learning concerning whether all or any of the charged has perpetrated any offense or not - the trial court wrongly held that the respondents were supported in bringing on the demise of three people in practice of their privilege of self-preservation - no legitimacy in offer - rejected. ','Sumatidevi M. Dhanwatay Vs Union Of India And Ors JUDGMENT\n\n2004(3) SCR 928\n\nThe following Judgment of the Court was delivered\n\nThe appellant travelled by 1st Class Air conditioned berth from Nagpur to\nBombay by Howrah-Bombay Mail. She was carrying her luggage which included\ngold, pearl, silver and diamond jewellery and other valuables valued at Rs.\n1,11,756. While she was travelling, she was assaulted by some unauthorised\npassengers and her gold, silver, pearl, diamond and other valuables were\ntaken away forcibly. This incident occurred on 4.12.1991. Thousands of\npersons entered into the compartment and assaulted the passengers,\nincluding the appellant. The said crowd was so violent that they broke the\ndoors, window bars, glass panels, seating berths and toilets etc. This\napart, the crowd committed so many other illegal acts of assaulting the\nbonafide passengers. They molested the women and even raped the young girl\npassengers. The appellant pulled the alarm chain three times, as a result\nof which, the train stopped at Igatpuri Station. She, alongwith other\nbonafide passengers got down at that station. She approached the Railway\nAuthorities for protection, but, without any assistance. On reaching\nBombay, she lodged a complaint with the police about the incident. The\nappellant approached the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission,\nMaharashtra State (hereinafter referred to as &apos;the State Commission&apos;, for\nshort) by filing a complaint claiming compensation of Rs. 9,32,256. The\nState Commission, after considering the material that was placed before it\nand on considering the rival contentions, allowed the claim of the\nappellant partly awarding total compensation of Rs. 1,41,756. The Railway\nadministration, aggrieved by and not satisfied with the said order, filed\nan appeal before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission\n(hereinafter referred to as &apos;the National Commission&apos;, for short). The\nNational Commission, by the order under challenge in this appeal, set aside\nthe order made by the State Commission. Hence this appeal.\n\nThe learned counsel for the appellant strongly contended that the National\nCommission was not right and justified on facts as well as in law in\nupsetting the order passed by the State Commission; the National Commission\nhas set aside the order made by the State Commission without dislodging the\nreasons given by the State Commission in allowing the claim made by the\nappellant; the National Commission has set aside the order of the State\nCommission simply stating that the State Commission was not right in\nupholding that there has been a deficiency in service on the part of the\nRailway administration. The learned counsel added that having regard to the\nfacts found, the State Commission was fully justified in ordering the\ncompensation.\n\nIn opposition, the learned counsel for the respondent Nos. 1 to 4 submitted\nthat the order impugned in this appeal is just and supportable order.\nAccording to her, the State Commission had no jurisdiction to entertain the\ncomplaint made by the appellant; there was no deficiency in service on the\npart of the Railway administration; when an unruly mob entered into the\nrailway compartment and caused damage on the person and property of the\npassengers, the Railway administration was helpless. In such a situation,\nno complaint could be entertained by the State Commission under the\nConsumer Protection Act, 1986.\n\nWe have considered the respective submissions made on behalf of the\nparties. As is evident from the order of the State Commission that opposite\nparties Nos 1, 3, 5 &amp; 6, i.e., Union of India, Chief Security\nCommissioner, Secretary, Home Department and Inspector General of Police,\nremained absent. No written version was filed by any of the parties on the\ndate given. The complaint was posted for final hearing on 14.9.1993, on\nwhich date the Union of India and the General Manager, Central Railway\nfiled written version jointly. The averment made in the complaint that the\nappellant travelled by train on that day when the incident happened, is\nadmitted. However, the Railway administration denied its responsibility as\nto the theft of luggage of the appellant and the injuries suffered by her.\nThe only contention of the Railway administration was that it was not\nresponsible for the toss of luggage and injuries caused to the appellant.\nThe State Commission, on consideration of the facts and circumstances, has\nrecorded that having regard to the past experience, the Railway\nadministration did not take reasonable steps to avoid such incident. It is\nalso recorded in the order of the State Commission that the allegations of\ninjuries suffered by the appellant and the loss caused to her luggage, the\nRailway administration had not been able to controvert effectively. It was\nsubmitted on behalf of the Railway administration before the State\nCommission that the claim as to the loss of ornaments urged by the\nappellant, was exaggerated. As&apos; regards loss of the Bank Draft, it was\ncontended that intimation could be given to the concerned Bank. An argument\nwas also advanced that the complaint was not maintainable under the\nprovisions of  Consumer Act- safety- Compansation- The appellant travelled by 1st Class Air conditioned berth from Nagpur to Bombay by Howrah-Bombay Mail- she was assaulted by some unauthorised passengers and her gold, silver, pearl, diamond and other valuables were taken away forcibly- They molested the women and even raped the young girl passengers. The appellant pulled the alarm chain three times, as a result of which, the train stopped at Igatpuri Station-She, alongwith other bonafide passengers got down at that station. She approached the Railway Authorities for protection, but, without any assistance- she lodged a complaint with the police about the incident. The appellant approached the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Maharashtra State by filing a complaint claiming compensation of Rs. 9,32,256- The State Commission, after considering the material that was placed before it and on considering the rival contentions, allowed the claim of the appellant partly awarding total compensation of Rs. 1,41,756- The Railway administration, aggrieved by and not satisfied with the said order, filed an appeal before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (hereinafter referred to as \'the National Commission\', for short). The National Commission, by the order under challenge in this appeal, set aside the order made by the State Commission. Hence this appeal-under Section 124A of the Railways Act, 1989, the Railway administration cannot escape the liability having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case and in the light of the incident that had taken place. As to the deficiency of service on the part of the Railway administration, no such plea was raised before the State Commission. The Railway administration also did not raise any issue as to the maintainability of the complaint or jurisdiction of the State Commission to deal with the complaint. Even otherwise, under Section 3 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, the complaint could be entertained by the State Commission in the absence of any such plea taken by the Railway administration as to the jurisdiction to entertain the complaint. This being the position, in our view, the impugned order passed by the National Commission cannot be sustained. No good reason was given by the National Commission to upset the order passed by the State Commission, as already observed. Under the circumstances, the appeal is entitled to succeed. Accordingly, it is allowed and the impugned order is set aside. The respondent-Railways shall pay Rs. 5000 to the appellant towards cost.

MOHAPATRA,J This appeal, filed by accused no.1 Babu Kuttan Ramkrishna Pillai and accused no.2 Umesh @ Babu Purshottam Bhatt of TADA ACT Spl.Case No.33 of 1994, is directed against the judgment and order dated 21.8.1998 of the Designated Court at Brihan `Mumbai under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 (for short TADA Act). In the said case seven accused persons faced trial under Section 120-B read with 307 r/w 34, 307 r/w 114, 307 r/w 149, 387 r/w 34, 143, 144, 147, 148 and 506 (ii), 353 r/w 114 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 3(2)(ii), 3(3), 3(5), 5 and 6 of the TADA Act and section r/w 25(IB)\r\n\r\n(a), Section 5 r/w 27 of the Arms Act. The gist of the prosecution case relevant for the purpose of this proceeding may be stated thus: With the growth of industry, commerce and trade in and around the city of Mumbai which generates substantial quantity of wealth, there has been increase of organised activities by gangs of anti-socials to extract money from affluent sections of society like developers, hoteliers and other businessmen by putting them in fear of death and then to demand substantial sums of money commonly known as &quot;Khadani&quot; i.e. protection money. One such gang was operating in the city under Amar Naik @ Bhai, who died a couple of years before the decision in the case at an encounter with the police. The prosecution alleged that in pursuance of a criminal conspiracy between 15.1.1994 to 16.5.1994 the accused persons and others of the gang embarked upon preparatory acts like procuring the information about the names of the builders of M/s Kalpataru Construction Company which was engaged in developing a property at Pali Hill, named Nakshatra Building. PW-7 Sudhir Tambe was the Senior Vice-President of the company with its head office at Nariman Point. He used to sit in the head- office. PW 6 Pachapur, Civil Engineer, was an employee of the company who used to remain at the site to supervise the construction. As the prosecution story runs, on 15.4.1994 between 11.30 a.m. and 12.00 noon while PW 6 was on duty at the construction site, accused no.3, Nitin Vasant Venugurlekar armed with revolver and accused No.4 Rajindera @ Rajan Mahadeo Margaj armed with a chopper and accused no.5 Jayendra @ Jai Anandrao Jadhav also armed with a chopper visited the site of Nakshatra Building; they threatened the workers at the site, forcibly brought PW 6 Pachapur in a room on the ground floor and man-handled him. Accused no.3, pointing a revolver at him demanded the name, address and telephone number of the builders. PW 6 disclosed the name of PW 7 Tambe and gave his telephone number to them. The accused then asked him to go to the office of the builders at Nariman Point and make the arrangement for a telephonic talk with Tambe. PW 6 rushed to the office and told Tambe of what had happened at the construction site. This was followed by telephonic calls from the accused who wanted to speak to Tambe. Attempts were made by PW 6 and PW 7 to avoid any discussion with the gangsters. Two or three days thereafter when the accused got Tambe on the telephone he (Tambe) gave them some other telephone numbers and asked them to contact those persons including one D.N.Ghosh, the Security Contractor. Eight/ten days thereafter again a telephone call was made to the office of Tambe which was received by PW 6 who was informed by the person making the call that they could not get D. N. Ghosh on the telephone numbers furnished by Tambe. Thereafter PW 6 handed over the receiver to Tambe. This incident was followed by several threats given by the gangsters to workers and also repeated telephone calls made to the Head Office of the company to contact Tambe. The staff of the site office absented from work resulting in virtual closure of construction activity. On 11.5.1994 the deceased Sanjay Patil telephoned to Tambe and warned him that he is wasting time and should meet him without further delay. After some days there was one more similar call from Sanjay Patil and he asked Tambe that he should talk to Bhai and saying so he handed over the receiver to another person who gave his identity as Amar Naik (since deceased), who told Tambe that he should pay Rs.10 lacs. The later pleaded his inability to pay such a heavy sum and after some discussion agreed to pay Rs.5 lacs. He was asked to come to Nakshatra Building site on 16.5.1994 along with money. In the meantime Tambe informed all the happenings to the Addl. Commissioner of Police Mr.Sanjeev Dayal and the then Dy. Commissioner of Police of Zone VII Mr. Rajanish Sheth within whose jurisdiction Khar Police Station fell.\r\n\r\nOn 16.5.1994 at about 12.00 noon the deceased Sanjay Patil telephoned Tambe and inquired from him as to what he was going to do about the payment and then Tambe replied that he will be leaving office at about 2.00 p.m. for Pali Hill. Sanjay Patil cautioned him that he should not make any haste and he should wait for his call so that he will take necessary instructions from his boss i.e. Amar Naik.

The	petitioner  is	diploma-  holder  in\nEngineering  and holds the post of Executive Engineer in the\nrespondent-Corporation. Till 1974, the promotion post of the\nsuperintending Engineer	 was  available	 both  for  diploma-\nholders and degree-holders according to merit-cum-seniority.\nThis was  so according	to  the	 practice  followed  by	 the\nCorporation without  making any	 rules or regulation in that\nbehalf. In  1974, the corporation made regulation by passing\na resolution  by passing a resolution and continued the same\npractice. Admittedly,  the regulation  were not	 made  under\nsection 64  of the  Maharashtra Industrial  Development Act,\n1961 [hereinafter  referred to as the &apos;Act&apos;] under which the\nrespondent-corporation was  created. Thereafter in 1988, the\ncorporation passed a resolution, for the first time,. making\n75 per	cent of	   the	posts  of  superintending  engineers\navailable to  the executive Engineers holding degrees and 25\nper cent  to  the  Executive  Engineers	 who  were  diploma-\nholders.  This	 resolution  was   also	 admittedly   not  a\nregulation made	 under the   said  section 64.	But for this\nresolution, the	 petitioner who was senior to respondent NO.\n2 would	 have been  promoted to	 the post  of Superintending\nEngineer on  31st October,  1990. However,  since respondent\nNo.2 was a degree holder, he got the said resolution and was\npromoted to the said post on that date. It is this promotion\nwhich was challenged by the petitioner by a writ petition in\nthe High  Court. The  High Court  by the  impugned  judgment\ndismissed the said petition.\n     2.	 Two   contentions  were  raised\n     before us.\n     (i) that no classification could be\n     made among	 the Executive Engineers\n     on the  basis of  their educational\n     qualification for	the  purpose  of\n     promotion	 to    the    post    of\n     superintending Engineer, since they\n     belong  to	  the  same   cadre   of\n     Executive Engineers and do the same\n     work.  There   was	 also  a  common\n     seniority	  of	the    Executive\n     Engineers	maintained.   hence  the\n     classification  was  discriminatory\n     in nature and violative of Articles\n     14 and 16 of the Constitution .\n     (ii)  that	  if  at   all	such   a\n     discrimination was	 permissible, it\n     could be  made only  be a statutory\n     rule  or  regulation  framed  under\n     Section 64	 of the said Act. A mere\n     resolution	   or	 an    executive\n     instruction could	not effect  such\n     discrimination.\n3.   We find  not merit in either of the two contentions. It\nis now	well settled  that for	the purpose  of promotion, a\nvalid classification  can made among the members holding the\nsame post  on the  basis of their qualification. In state of\nJummu &amp;	 Kashmir v.  Triloki Nath Khosa &amp; Ors., [1974] 1 SCR\n771, a Constitution Bench of his court has clearly held that\nsuch a	classification is  permissible and  does not violate\nArticles 14  and  16  of  the  Constitution  the  Court	 has\nobserved there that in state of Mysore &amp; Anr. v. P. Narasing\nRao, [1968]  1 SCR  407 and The Union of India and others v.\nDr.(Mrs.) S.B.	Kholi, AIR  1973 SC 811, it was already held\nthat   classification	 on   the   basis   of	 educational\nqualification was  permissible. The  Court then	 referred to\nRoshan Lal  Tandon v.  Union of India, [1968] 1 SCR  185 and\ndistinguished it  on the facts by pointing out that it was a\ncase of	 the direct  recruits and  promotees integrated into\none cadre.  Once they  were integrated they lost their birth\nbirth-marks, viz.  the different   sources  from which	they\nwere recruited.	 [Emphasis supplied].  The court pointed out\nthat Roshan Lal&apos;s case [supra] was thus no authority for the\nproposition that  if direct  recruits  and    promotees	 are\nintegrated into	 one class  they cannot	 be  classified	 for\npurposed of promotion on a basis other than that in the case\nbefore the them the classified for purpose of promotion on a\nbasis  other  than  that  they	were  drawn  from  different\nsources.

','Shyamcharan Sharma Vs Dharamdas      CIVIL APPELLATE  JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 854, of\n1977.\n     Appeal by	Special Leave  from the	 Judgment and  order\ndated 2-8-1976	of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in S.A. No.\n440/71.\n     S. S. Khanduja and Lalit Kumar Gupta for the Appellant.\n     T. P. Naik and S. K. Gambhir for the Respondent.\n     The Judgment of the Court was delivered by\n     CHINNAPPA	REDDY,	 J.-The	 respondent-landlord  sought\neviction of  the appellant-tenant  from the suit premises an\ntwo grounds:  (i) failure  to pay  arrears of  rent  of	 Rs.\n158.25 despite service of notice of demand and (ii) bonafide\nrequirement of	premises for landlord&apos;s personal occupation.\nThe second  ground was	rejected by  all the  sub-  ordinate\ncourts and  we are  no longer concerned with that ground. In\nregard to  the first  ground, the trial Court found that the\ntenant was\n \nin arrears  of payment	of rent	 but  that  the	 tenant	 was\nentitled to the Protection of s. 12(3) of the Madhya Pradesh\nAccommodation Control Act, 1961, as the tenant had deposited\nthe arrears  of rent within the time allowed by the Court on\nhis application.  When the  appeal preferred by the landlord\nwas pending before the Additional District Judge, Satna, the\ntenant filed  an application  for condonation  of delay R in\ndepositing the	rent,  month  by  month,  which	 had  become\npayable after  the filing  of the  suit, as stipulated by s.\n13(1) of  the Act.  It appears	that, on  several occasions,\nwhen the  suit and  the appeal were pending before the trial\ncourt and  the appellate  court respectively, the tenant had\ndeposited the monthly rent a day or two or three, beyond the\nprescribed date.  The amount  had been received by the court\nand drawn  out	by  the	 landlord,  apparently	without	 any\nprotest. Taking	 advantage of  the filing  of  the  tenant&apos;s\napplication for condonation of delay, the landlord contended\nthat the  court had  no power to extend the time for deposit\nof the monthly rent and that he was entitled to a decree for\neviction  consequent   on  the	 non-compliance	  with	 the\nprovisions  of	 s.  13	  (  1	 )  of	the  Madhya  Pradesh\nAccommodation Control Act. The appellate court negatived the\nlandlord&apos;s contention and dismissed the appeal. The landlord\npreferred a  Second Appeal  to	the  High  Court  of  Madhya\nPradesh. The High Court, holding that the court had no power\nto extend  time, decreed  the suit for eviction. The tenant,\nhaving obtained special leave, has appealed to this Court.\n     Shri  Khanduja,  learned  counsel	for  the  appellant,\nraised two  contentions before	us. The first contention was\nthat the  High Court was wrong in holding that the Court had\nno power to condone the delay in depositing the monthly rent\nfalling due  after the	filing of the suit for eviction. The\nsecond contention  was that,  in the  circumstances  of	 the\ncase. the  respondent must  be considered  to have waived or\nabandoned the right to insist on dis-entitling the tenant of\nthe protection	to which  he was  otherwise  entitled.	Shri\nNaik, learned  counsel for  the respondent, contended to the\ncontrary on both the questions.\n     The Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Control Act, 1961, was\nenacted, as recited in the statement of objects and reasons,\n\"for the  purpose of  controlling, letting  of and  rents of\nresidential  and  nonresidential  accommodation	 and  giving\nadequate protection  to tenants	 of  such  accommodation  in\nareas where there is dearth of accommodation\". Section 12(1)\nof the	Act provides  that no  suit shall  be-filed ill	 any\ncivil court  against a	tenant for  his	 eviction  from	 any\naccommodation except on one or more of the grounds specified\ntherein. Several  grounds are specified, such as, failure to\npay the	 arrears of  rent after	 the service  of  notice  of\ndemand, unlawful sub-letting of the whole or\n \npart of	 the accommodation, creation of a nuisance, bonafide\nrequirement of the accommodation by the landlord for his own\noccupation,   causing	of   substantial   damage   to	 the\naccommodation  etc.  etc.  The	ground	with  which  we	 are\nconcerned is that mentioned in s. 12(1) (a) and-it is: \"that\nthe tenant  has neither	 paid nor  tendered the whole of the\narrears of  rent legally  recoverable from  him	 within	 two\nmonths of  the date  on which  a notice	 of demand  for	 the\narrears of  rent has  been served  on him by the landlord in\nthe prescribed	manner\". Thus,	where a tenant is in arrears\nof rent,  a landlord  is obliged,  before instituting a suit\nfor eviction  on that  ground, to  serve a  notice of demand\ncalling upon  the tenant  to pay  or tender the whole of the\narrears of  rent within two months of the date of service of\nthe notice. S. 12(3) provides that an order for the eviction\nof a  tenant shall not be made on the ground specified in s.\n12(1) (a),  if	the  tenant  makes  payment  or	 deposit  as\nrequired by  s. 13. S. 13,sub-ss. (1), (5) and (6) which are\nrelevant for the present purpose are as follows:\n	  \"13. (1)  on a suit or proceeding being instituted\n     by the landlord on any of the grounds referred to in s.\n     12, the  tenant shall,  within one month of the service\n     of the  writ of  summons on  him or within such further\n     time as  the Court	 may, on  an application made to it,\n     allow in  this behalf,  deposit in	 the Court or pay to\n     the landlord  an amount  calculated at the rate of rent\n     at which  it was  paid, for  the period  for which	 the\n     tenant may	 have  made  default  including	 the  period\n     subsequent thereto	 up to the end of the month previous\n     to that  in which	the deposit  or payment	 is made and\n     shall thereafter  continue to  deposit or pay, month by\n     month, by	the 15th  of each  succeeding  month  a	 sum\n     equivalent to the rent at that rate.\n     xx		xx	  xx	    xx	     xx\n	  (5) If  a  tenant  makes  deposit  or	 payment  as\n     required by  sub-section (1)  or  sub-section  (2),  no\n     decree or	order shall  be made  by the  Court for	 the\n     recovery of  possession of	 the  accommodation  on	 the\n     ground of default in the payment of rent by the tenant,\n     but the Court may allow such cost as it may deem fit to\n     the  The respondent-landlord	sought	 expulsion of	 the \r\n\r\nappealing party occupant from the suit	 premises for inability to pay \r\n\r\nunpaid debts of lease, regardless of administration of notice of interest. The \r\n\r\ntrial court found that the occupant was falling behind financially o. installment \r\n\r\nof lease, however the inhabitant having stored the back payments of lease \r\n\r\ninside the time permitted by the court on his application the \r\n\r\noccupant was qualified for benefit the security of segment 12(3) \r\n\r\nof the	Madhya Pradesh	Accommodation Control Act. 1961. furthermore, \r\n\r\nexpelled the suit for expulsion. \r\n\r\nThe proprietor favored an interest keeping in mind the same was \r\n\r\npending? the occupant recorded an application under area 13(1) \r\n\r\nof the	Act for	 approbation of	 delay in depositing,,	 the \r\n\r\nlease, month by month.	which had turned out to be payable after the \r\n\r\ndocumenting of the suit. On a few events, when the suit and \r\n\r\nthe interest were pending under the watchful eye of the trial court and	 the \r\n\r\ninvestigative court	 separately, the inhabitant had saved the \r\n\r\nmonth to month lease a day or a few past the endorsed \r\n\r\ndate, and the same had been gotten by the court and drawn \r\n\r\nout by	the landowner, with no dissent. The landowner, \r\n\r\nexploiting the documenting of the occupant s application \r\n\r\nfor condonation	 of postponement, fought that the court had no \r\n\r\nenergy to amplify the ideal opportunity for store of the month to month lease and \r\n\r\nthat he	 was qualified for an announcement for expulsion resulting on \r\n\r\nthe resistance with the arrangements of area 13(1) of \r\n\r\nthe Act. The redrafting court negatived this dispute and \r\n\r\nrejected the interest. In the second interest favored by the \r\n\r\nproprietor, the High Court held that the Court had no energy to \r\n\r\nbroaden time and declared the Suit for ousting. \r\n\r\nIn the occupant\'s interest to this Court on the question \r\n\r\nwhether the Court ha(l. the ability to overlook the deferral in \r\n\r\nsaving the month to month lease falling due after the filling of \r\n\r\nthe suit for ousting. \r\n\r\n^ \r\n\r\nHELD :1. The court had the purview to augment time \r\n\r\nfor store or installment of month to month lease falling due after the \r\n\r\nrecording of the suit. [338 G] \r\n\r\n2. Keeping in mind the end goal to qualifies an inhabitant for claim the insurance \r\n\r\nof area 12(3). the inhabitant needed to make installment or store \r\n\r\nas required by section	 13. The unfulfilled obligations of lease ought to be \r\n\r\npaid or	 stored inside one month of the administration of the \r\n\r\nwrit of summons on the inhabitant or inside such further time as \r\n\r\nmay he	allowed by the court, and ought to further store or \r\n\r\npay each month by the fifteenth. a whole identical to the lease. \r\n\r\n[338 A-B]. \r\n\r\n335 \r\n\r\n3. Failure	 to pay	 or store a whole identical to the \r\n\r\nlease by	 the fifteenth of consistently, ensuing to the recording \r\n\r\nof the	suit for removal will	 not entitle the proprietor, \r\n\r\nstraightaway, to a declaration for removal. The results of \r\n\r\nthe store or payment	 and non-installment or non-store are \r\n\r\nrecommended by subsection and (6) of segment 13. [338 B] \r\n\r\n4. A circumspection is vested in the court under segment \r\n\r\n13(6) to arrange the striking out of the, protection against \r\n\r\nexpulsion. [338 D] \r\n\r\n5. In the event that the court has the	discretion not to strike out \r\n\r\nthe protection or an inhabitant submitting default in installment or \r\n\r\nstore of lease as required by segment 13(1), the court \r\n\r\nmost likely has the further tact to approve the default and \r\n\r\namplify the ideal opportunity for installment or store. Such a tact is \r\n\r\na fundamental ramifications of the tact not to strike out \r\n\r\nthe defence.	Any other development may	lead, to a \r\n\r\ncorruption of the question of the Act. to be specific, \'the satisfactory \r\n\r\nsecurity of the occupant.\' [338 F-G] \r\n\r\n6. Section	 12(3) qualifies an inhabitant for claim insurance \r\n\r\nagainst removal on the ground indicated in area 12(1)(a) \r\n\r\nin the event that he makes installment or store as required by area 13. As \r\n\r\nthe court has under area 13, the ability to degree: the \r\n\r\ntime for installment or store, installment or store, inside the \r\n\r\naugmented time	 will entitle	 the inhabitant to claim	 the \r\n\r\ninsurance of segment 12(3). [338 H] 1 \r\n\r\n7. Express	 arrangement for augmentation of time for store \r\n\r\non the other hand installment or lease falling due after the documenting of the suit \r\n\r\nwas not	 made in area 13(1!	 as the	 result of non- \r\n\r\ninstallment was managed with	 by a different sub-area, segment \r\n\r\n13(6). The watchfulness given to the court under segment 13(6) \r\n\r\nmust suggest a caution to excuse the postponement and broaden the \r\n\r\ntime in	 making deposit	 or installment under area 13(1). \r\n\r\n[339A, E] \r\n\r\nJagdish Kapoor v.

The	Income	Tax  Officer\nlater  on came to know that the assessee&apos;s income  from	 the\nsale  of  estates had escaped assessment.

What is the line  which  separates\n	      the  two classes of cases may be difficult  to\n	      define,  and  each  case	must  be  considered\n	      according	 to  its facts; the question  to  be\n	      determined  being-Is the sum of gain that	 has\n	      been  made  a  mere enhancement  of  value  by\n	      realising	 a security or is it a gain made  in\n	      the  operation of business in carrying  out  a\n	      scheme for profit making ?\"\nBut  in judging the character of such  transactions  several\nfactors	 have been treated as significant in decided  cases.\nFor instance, if a transaction related to the business which\nis normally carried on by the assessee, though not  directly\na  part of it, an intention to launch upon an  adventure  in\nthe  nature  of trade may readily be  inferred.	  A  similar\ninference  would  arise where a commodity is  purchased	 and\nsub-divided,  altered,	treated or repaired and sold  or  is\nconverted  into	 a different commodity and then	 sold.	 The\nmagnitude of the transaction of purchase, the nature of	 the\ncommodity,  the	 subsequent dealings of	 the  assessee,	 the\nnature of the Organisation employed by the assessee and	 the\nmanner of disposal may be such that, the transaction may  be\nstamped	 with the character of a trading nature.  In  Martin\nv.  Lowry, (2) the assessee purchased a large  quantity of\naeroplane  linen and sold it in different lots, and for	 the\npurpose of  selling it started	an  advertising	 campaign,\nrented	offices	  engaged an advertising  manager,  a  linen\nexpert	and  a	staff of clerks.  maintained  account  books\nnormally used by a trader, and passed receipts add payment\n(1) [1904] 5 S.T.C. 159,16-66.\n(2) 11 Tax Cases 297.\n \nin  connection	with the linen through	a  separate  banking\naccount.,  It  was  held that the  assessee  carried  on  an\nadventure  in  the  nature of trade and so  the	 profit	 was\nliable to be taxed.  The same view was taken in Rutledge  v.\nCommissioners of Inland Revenue(1) in regard to an  assessee\nwho  purchased very cheaply a vast quantity of toilet  paper\nand   within  a	 short	time  thereafter  sold	 the   whole\nconsignment   at  a  considerable  profit.   Similarly,	  in\nCommissioner of Inland Revenue v. Fraser (2) the assessee, a\nwoodcutter,  bought  for resale, whisky in  bond,  in  three\n&apos;lots.	 He  sold it later on at considerable  profit.	 The\nassessee had never dealt in whisky before, he had no special\nknowledge  of  the  trade he did not take  delivery  of	 the\nwhisky	nor did he have it blended and advertised.  Even  so\nit  was	 held that the transaction was an adventure  in	 the\nnature	of  trade.  Lord President Normand observed  in	 the\ncourse of the judgment :\n	      \"It  is  in general more easy to hold  that  a\n	      single   transaction   entered  into   by	  an\n	      individual  in  the  line	 of  his  own  trade\n	      (although not part and parcel of his  ordinary\n	      business)	 is  an adventure in the  nature  of\n	      trade than to hold that a transaction  entered\n	      into by an individual outside the line of	 his\n	      own trade or occupation is an adventure in the\n	      nature of trade.	But what is a good deal more\n	      important	 is  the nature of  the	 transaction\n	      with reference to the commodity dealt in.	 The\n	      individual  who enters into a purchase  of  an\n	      article  or  commodity may have  in  view	 the\n	      resale  of it at a profit, and yet it  may  be\n	      that  is	not the only purpose  for  which  he\n	      purchased	 the article of the  commodity,	 nor\n	      the only purpose to which he might turn it  if\n	      favourable opportunity of sale does not occur.\n	      In some of the cases the purchase of a picture\n	      has been given as an illustration.  An amateur\n	      may  purchase  a picture with a  view  to	 its\n	      resale  at a profit, and yet he may  recognise\n	      at the time or afterwards that the  possession\n	      of   the	picture	 will  give  him   aesthetic\n	      enjoyment	 if he is unable ultimately,  or  at\n	      his chosen time, to realise it at a profit.  A\n	      man may purchase stocks and shares with a view\n	      to selling them at an early date at a  profit,\n	      but, if he does so, he is purchasing something\n	      which  is	 itself an investment,	a  potential\n	      source of revenue to him while he holds it.  A\n	      man may purchase land with a view to realising\n	      it  at a profit, but it also may yield him  an\n	      income  while he continues to hold it.  If  he\n	      continues	 to  hold it, there may	 be  also  a\n	      certain pride of possession But the  purchaser\n	      of  a  large  quantity  of  a  commodity	like\n	      whisky,  greatly	in excess of what  could  be\n	      used by\n	      (1) 14Tax Cases490.\n	      (2) 24 Tax Cases 498.\n \n	      himself,	his family and friends, a  commodity\n	      which  yields  no pride of  possession,  which\n	      cannot  be  turned  to account  except  by.  a\n	      process	of  realisation,  I   can   scarcely\n	      consider	to be other than an adventure  in  a\n	      transaction  in the nature of a trade;  and  I\n	      can find no single fact among those stated  by\n	      the  Commissioners which in any way  traverses\n	      that  view.  In my opinion, the fact that	 the\n	      transaction  was	not in the way	of  business\n	      (whatever it was) of the respondent in no	 way\n	      alters the character which almost	 necessarily\n	      belongs to a transaction like this\".\nThese are cases of commercial commodities but a	 transaction\nof purchase of land cannot be assumed without more to be  an\nadventure in the nature of trade.  In Leeming v. Jones,(1) a\nsyndicate  was	formed to acquire an option  over  a  rubber\nestate with a view to resell it at a profit, and finding the\nestate	too small the syndicate acquired another estate	 and\nsold  the  two	estates on profit.  It	was  held  that	 the\ntransaction  was not in the nature of trade and	 the  profit\nwas  not  liable to be assessed to tax.	 The same  view	 was\nexpressed in Saroj Kumar Mazumdar v. Commissioner of  Income\nTax  (2)  in which the assessee who carried on	business  of\nengineering   works   purchased	 land,	 which	 was   under\nrequisition by the Government, negotiated a sale before	 the\nland  was  de-requisitioned and sold it after the  land	 was\nreleased.   But the circumstances of a particular  case	 may\nlead to the conclusion that the purchaser resale of land  is\nin  the	 nature of trade.  In Venkataswami Naidu  &amp;  Co.  v.\nCommissioner of Income Tax(3) the appellant firm which acted\nas  managing agents purchas  the appellant was assessed for the assessment year 1956-57 on a total income of Rs. 8,400. The Income Tax Officer later on came to know that the assessee\'s income from the sale of estates had escaped assessment. The Income Tax Officer took action under section 34(1) (a) of the Income Tax Act, 1922 for the assessment year 1956-57 on 13th August, 1959. Under an agreement dated 18th May, 1955 a company called Mundakayam Valley Rubber Co. Ltd. sold and delivered an estate called Kuttikal Estate to one Mr. A. V. George. The area of the estate was 477 acres and 71 cents. Mr. A. V. George had entered into the agreement in his own name and on behalf of another company called the Kailas Rubber Co. Ltd. It was agreed that the vendor would execute the necessary conveyance in favour of Mr. A. V. George or his nominees. On 15th August. 1955. the assessee entered into an agreement with Mr. A. V. George whereby the assessee agreed to purchase 477.71 acres forming part of Kuttikal Estate for Rs. 6 lakhs. An advance of Rs. 1 1,000 was paid by the assessee. The balance of Rs. 5,89,000 was to be paid by the assessee on or before 25th September, 1955. It was agreed that Mr. A. V. George should execute a sale-deed himself or cause it to be executed Kailas Rubber Co. Ltd. on whose behalf he was acting in favour of the assessee or his nominees. The assessee subsequently divided the area of 477.71 acres into 23 plots and found purchasers for 22 of these, plots. The total extent of 22 plots for which he found purchasers was 373.58 acres and the total price paid by the 22 purchasers was Rs. 5,18,500. A sale deed was executed by the Mundakayam Valley Rubber Co. Ltd. on 31st March, 1956. It covered all the 23 plots. The 22 plots for which the assessee found purchasers were conveyed to the respective purchasers and the 23rd plot was conveyed to the assesses himself. Mr. A. V. George and the Kailas Rubber Co. Ltd. were parties to this document. The plot which the assessee had retained for himself was 104.13 acres in extent. Its value was estimated by the Income Tax Officer at Rs. 2,08,000. \r\nheld: he Income-tax authorities have correctly estimated the profit of the assessee by treating the land as stock-in-trade and valuing it according to the normal accountancy practice. \r\nappeal dismissed ','Bakhshish Singh Vs Union Of India (Uoi) And Ors. JUDGMENT\n  \n\nO. Chinnappa Reddy, J.\n \n\n1. Bakhshish Singh, the appellant, was appointed an Assistant in the Punjab Civil Secretariat on December 7, 1948 and was confirmed on September 1, 1956. Manohar Singh, Sardar Singh, D. Justin and Prithipal Singh Chawala, respondents 3 to 6 were also Assistants in &apos;. the Punjab Civil Secretariat, but were junior to the appellant. All of them were working as Assistants on November 1, 1956 when consequent on the State&apos;s Reorganisation Act, the former States of Punjab and PEPSU were merged into one State. On merger the conditions of service of those employed by the former States of Punjab and PEPSU were protected as provided by Sections 115(7) and 117 of the State&apos;s Reorganisation Act. The rules in force at that time, which governed them, were the Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Services Class III) Rules, 1952. Rule 6(1)(b) provided that posts of Superintendents, Records in the service were to be filled by selection among Assistants. Posts of Assistants-in-charge were to be filled (i) by promotion of Assistants; or (ii) by transfer or deputation of an official already in Government service. Rule 6 (1) (c) provided that posts of Assistants-in-charge were to be filled (i) by promotion of Assistants; or (ii) by transfer or deputation of an official already in Government service. Rule 6(I)(d) provided that the post of Superintendent, Military Secretary to Governor&apos;s office was to be filled by selection amongst\n Assistant. In October, 1963, the posts of Superintendents were made class II posts and came to be governed by the Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Service Class II) Rules. Rule 8(1)(a) provided that posts of Superintendents other than the Superintendent in the Press Branch were to be made (i) by promotion from amongst Deputy Superintendents, Assistants-in-charge and Assistants, who are members of the Punjab Civil Secretariat\n (State Service Class III) with minimum experience of one year as Deputy Superintendent or a total experience of 10 years as an Assistant; or (ii) by direct recruitment or by transfer or deputation of an official already in Government service holding a ministerial post. We are not concerned with the proviso to Rule 8(I)(a). Rule 8(I)(b) dealt with the post of Superintendent, Press Branch with which also we are not concerned. While this was so, as an experimental measure some posts of Assistant Section Officers were created which were not posts which belonged either to the Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Services Class III) or Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Services Class II). Appointment\n to these posts were to be made from Assistants belonging to the Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Services Class III) on the basis of an examination to be held by the Public Service Commission. Respondents 3 to 6 were selected and appointed as Assistant Section Officers as they were successful in the examination. The appellant either did not appear at the examination or was not successful at the examination. Therefore, he continued as Assistant in the Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Service Class III). By an order dated March 14, 1961, the Government expressly provided that the seniority of those appointed as Assistant Section Officers in their normal lines as Assistants will remain unchanged and that their promotion as Deputy Superintendents/Superintendents will be governed by their seniority as Assistants. Even so some Assistant Section Officers were promoted as Superintendents without reference to their seniority as Assistants. The promotions were quashed by the Punjab High Court in Roshan Lal Sharma&apos;s 1966 Ct. L J. 848 case. The State of Punjab thereupon thought fit to amend the Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Services Class II) by introducing a new Rule 8(I)(a)(i) in the place of the old Rule 8(I)(a)(i) which was as follows :-\n (i) By promotion from amongst Assistant Section Officers and such Deputy Superintendents, Assistants-in-charge and Assistants as are member of the Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Service Class III) with minimum experience of one year as a Deputy Superintendent or a total experience of ten years as an Assistant. \n \n\nTwo explanations were added and Explanation II provided that the number of posts of Superintendent and Section Officers available for promotion from amongst\n Assistant Section Officers shall bear the some proportion to the total number of such posts as the branch manned by Assistant Section Officers and Section Officers bear to the number of branches manned by Assistants and Superintendents, the method of promotion to vacancies available in such proportion being that persons, other than the Assistant Section Officers shall be promoted first and the Assistant Section Officers shall be promoted thereafter and so on. The Government of Punjab thought it advisable to obtain the approval of the Central Government as the High Court in Roshan Lal Sharma&apos;s case had said that the promotion of Assistant Section Officers to the posts of Superintendents based on their seniority as Assistant Section Officers was violative of the guarantees given by the State&apos;s Reorganisation Act. After seeking some clarification from the State Government, the Government of India wrote to the State Government as follows : -\n \n \n\nNo. 17/57/66-SR (S)\n \n\nGovernment of India/Ministry of Home Affairs.\n \n\nTo \n\nThe Chief Secretary to Government of Punjab, Secretariat Administration, Chandigarh.\n \n\nNew Delhi-1, the 20th May, 1967.\n \n\nSub : Integration of Services in Punjab-Rules for promotion to the post of Superintendent-Provision for promotion of Assistant Section Officers-Approval of the Central Government under the S.R.

In view of the fact that under the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, retrospective approval cann  Service- state of administration - Sections 115 and 117 of States Reorganization Act, 1956 and Rules 6 (I) and 8 (I) of Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Service Class III) Rules,1952 - claim against expulsion of request of testing advancement of respondents - respondents were junior to appellants - litigant fought ensure given to litigant by Sections115 (7) and 117 abused if there should be an occurrence of making of posts of Assistant Section Officers and by arrangement of advancement to posts of Superintendent in Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Service Class II) - making of new posts outside Class III administration and making people holding those posts qualified for advancement decreased odds of advancement of Assistants having a place with Punjab Civil Secretariat (State Service Class III) - there was no repudiation of Section 115 (7) - there was no adjustment in states of administration - respondents were youngsters to appealing party in framework of Assistants - appealing party did not profit himself of chance stood to him to qualify himself as Assistant Section Officer by passing recommended examination - appealing party can\'t be heard to whine that the individuals who were youngsters to him as Assistant have stolen walk over him - offer expelled.

She met with an accident on or about\n\n20.9.1999 while she was aged only 9 years. In the said accident she suffered\n\nthe following injuries, as stated in the application filed on her behalf before\n\nthe Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal :\n\n\n             1.     There is swelling deformity &amp; fracture of\n                    middle 3rd of Lt. thigh (femur shaft).\n             2.     Abrasion over left frontal region.\n \n\n             3.     Abrasion over Rt. Lateral aspect.\"\n\n\n3.    She was treated by two doctors. According to one of them, namely,\n\nDr. Mukund, who examined himself as PW3, she suffered 10% to 15% of\n\ndisability whereas according to the other doctor, Dr. Shivanand, she suffered\n\n20% to 25% of physical disability in her left lower limb.\n\n\n      An amount of Rs.3,00,000/- was claimed by her by way of\n\ncompensation in the claim petition before the Motor Accidents Claims\n\nTribunal under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereinafter\n\ncalled and referred to for the sake of brevity as `the Act&apos;). The Tribunal,\n\nhowever, having regard to the evidences brought on record, opining that\n\npermanent disability suffered by her would be 10%, a sum of Rs.40,000/-\n\nawarded on the said ground. The total amount of compensation determined\n\nwas a sum of Rs.72,785/- details of which are as under :\n\n\n                   \"Rs.18,000/- towards pain and sufferings\n             and agony, Rs. 12,460 towards diet and attendant\n             charges and Rs.323/- were awarded towards\n             medical expenses.\"\n\n\n4.    On an appeal preferred thereagainst, the High Court, without\n\nassigning any reason, enhanced the amount of compensation to\n\nRs.1,12,000/-, stating :\n \n\n            \"Petitioner could be awarded Rs.30,000/- for pain\n            and agony, Rs.10,000/- for medical and incidental\n            expenses relating to treatment, Rs.15,000/- for loss\n            of amenities and discomfort on account of\n            disability, Rs.27,000/- (1500 X 18) for loss of\n            future earnings on account of disability and\n            Rs.20,000/- for loss of marriage prospects on\n            account of disability. In all, the petitioner is\n            entitled to the compensation of Rs.1,12,000/- as\n            against Rs.72,785/- awarded by the Tribunal. On\n            the enhanced compensation, the interest payable\n            shall be 6% p.a. from the date of petition till\n            payment.\"\n\n\n5.    Appellant being aggrieved by and dissatisfied therewith is before us.\n\n\n6.    Mr. P.V.V. Shetty, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\nappellant, would contend that the High Court committed a serious error in\n\nawarding only a sum of Rs.1,12,000/- without taking into consideration her\n\nprospect of marriage. The amount of compensation on the basis of notional\n\nincome should not have been determined, urging that even if she was to\n\nwork as a labourer, she would have earned at Rs.4,000/- per month.\n\n\n7.    Indisputably, she was a child at that time. She had no earning. What\n\namount could be awarded towards future loss of earning or prospective loss\n\nof earning could not have been determined on the basis of any legal\n\nprinciple. Compensation for the injuries suffered by a person in a motor\n\nvehicle accident can be determined either on the basis of the actual damages\n\nsuffered or upon application of the structured formula. Although for the\n \n\npurpose of invoking the provisions of Section 163A of the Act, a legal\n\nprinciple may be found in the Second Schedule thereof.           The Second\n\nSchedule provides that where no income is proved, notional income for the\n\npurpose of payment of compensation to those who had no income prior to\n\naccident, a sum of Rs.15,000/- per annum would be considered as the\n\nmultiplicand. The multiplier which was required to be applied would be 15.\n\nParagraph 4 and 5 of the said Schedule reads as under :\n\n\n            \"4.

The exact prayer, contained in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 173  of  2010,\r\n    would give a glimpse of  the  nature  of  the  case  set  up  by  these\r\n    petitioners and the precise relief which these  petitioners  pray  for.\r\n    This prayer reads as under:\r\n               It is, therefore, respectfully prayed that Your  Lordships  may\r\n            graciously be pleased to:\r\n\r\n\r\n               i) Issue a writ, order or direction directing the respondents\r\n                  more particularly Respondent Nos. 1 to 3  to  appoint  the\r\n                  petitioners and similarly circumstanced  Trained  Teachers\r\n                  in order of seniority.\r\n\r\n\r\n              ii) Issue a writ, order or direction directing the respondents\r\n                  and more particularly the State of  Jharkhand  (Respondent\r\n                  Nos. 1 to 3)  to  protect  fundamental  right  of  Primary\r\n                  Education  to  the  children  of  State  of  Jharkhand  by\r\n                  appointing the Trained Teachers available in the Jharkhand\r\n                  State  on  the  sanctioned  vacant  posts   of   Assistant\r\n                  Teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n             iii) Pass such other or orders as this Honourable Court  may  deem\r\n                  fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of the  case\r\n                  and in the interests of justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  The background in which these petitions have come  to  be\r\n     filed is somewhat detailed one with chequered  history,  riddled  with\r\n     previous litigation  benefit  whereof  the  petitioners  are  seeking.\r\n     However, we would endeavour to traverse through  these  events  in  as\r\n     simple a manner as possible.\r\n     3.     As is well known, the State of Jharkhand  was  created  in  the\r\n     year 2000. Before that it was a part of the State of Bihar. All  these\r\n     petitioners belong to undivided Bihar vintage. They  claim  that  they\r\n     are  qualified   and   trained   teachers   who   acquired   requisite\r\n     qualification  and  underwent  necessary  training  and  thus   became\r\n     eligible to be considered for appointment as primary teachers  in  the\r\n     schools run by the State Government  as  per  the  provisions  of  the\r\n     Extant Rules on the subject. However, even  when  the  Government  was\r\n     legally bound to appoint only the trained teachers, on the basis of an\r\n     advertisement issued on 6.10.1991  by  the  Government  of  Bihar  for\r\n     filling up of 25,000 posts of Assistant Teachers, the State  recruited\r\n     17,281  untrained  teachers  out  of  total  appointments  of   19,272\r\n     Assistant  Teachers  made  in  the  said  recruitment  process.   This\r\n     selection was challenged by some persons by filing  writ  petition  in\r\n     the High Court of Judicature at Patna which was decided on  26.9.1996.\r\n     The High Court did not quash the appointments already made, though  at\r\n     the same time it held that the State  would  not  force  a  person  to\r\n     confine his application to a particular district. Against this  order,\r\n     Special Leave Petition No. 23187 of 1996  was  preferred  before  this\r\n     Court. In those proceedings an affidavit dated 14.8.1997 was filed  by\r\n     the Deputy Superintendent of Education, Bihar Government  agreeing  to\r\n     appoint trained teacher against existing vacancies. Having  regard  to\r\n     the averments made in the said affidavit, SLP  was  disposed  of  vide\r\n     order dated 5.9.1997. This case is known as Ram Vinay Kumar &amp; Ors.  v.\r\n     State of Bihar and  Ors.  (1998)  9  SCC  227.  The  exact  directions\r\n     regarding appointment to the post of  Assistant  Teachers  which  were\r\n     given by this Court are the following:\r\n              (i)  The Commission shall conduct a special selection  for  the\r\n           purpose of appointment of  these  unfilled  posts  from  amongst\r\n           applicants who had submitted their applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n           (ii)  The selection shall be confined to  applicants  possessing\r\n           teacher\'s  training/  qualification  obtained  from  government/\r\n           private teacher\'s training institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n           (iii) The selection shall be made by holding a preliminary  test\r\n           and a written examination of the candidates who qualify  in  the\r\n           preliminary test.\r\n\r\n\r\n       iv) In case the number of persons found suitable for appointment  in\r\n           such special selection exceeds the number  of  posts  for  which\r\n           recruitment was to be made on the basis of  advertisement  dated\r\n           6.10.1991, the surplus number of candidates who have been  found\r\n           suitable for the appointment would be justified against posts to\r\n           be filled on the basis of subsequent selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        v) The special selection which is to be conducted in  pursuance  of\r\n           these  directions  shall  be  completed  by  the  Commission  by\r\n           31.1.1997.   \r\n\r\n\r\n  4. In nut-shell, the direction was to conduct  a  special  selection  for\r\n     filling up of the unfilled posts from amongst the applicants  who  had\r\n     already submitted their applications  pursuant  to  the  advertisement\r\n     issued and it  was  to  be  confined  to  those  applicants  who  were\r\n     possessing teachers training/ qualification obtained from  Government/\r\n     private teachers\' training institution i.e. from amongst  the  trained\r\n     teachers. As per the petitioners as  on  30.9.1993  there  were  about\r\n     45,000 vacancies in as much as against total post of 2,09,981,  number\r\n     of teachers working were 1,54,751. Furthermore, in  next  three  years\r\n     about 18,431 teachers were expected to  retire.  Therefore,  projected\r\n     vacancies were approximately 63,000. On the creation of the  State  of\r\n     Jharkhand in terms of Bihar  Reorganisation  Act,  2000  proportionate\r\n     vacancies i.e. one-third came to the share of State of Jharkhand which\r\n     would mean that 21,000 vacancies were available on the date  on  which\r\n     this State was created.\r\n     5.     It is stated by the petitioners that for almost  7  years  from\r\n     the date of directions given in Ram Vinay Kumar\'s Case, no action  was\r\n     taken. It forced certain sections of trained teachers to approach  the\r\n     Patna High Court by way of several  Writ  Petitions.  All  these  Writ\r\n     Petitions were heard together with leading case known as Nand  Kishore\r\n     Ojha &amp; Ors. v. State of Bihar and Ors. (CWJC 13246/2003).  These  Writ\r\n     Petitions were allowed by the Patna High  Court  vide  judgment  dated\r\n     1.7.2004. In the said judgment it was inter alia noted that there were\r\n     number of unfilled vacancies because of  which  primary  schools  were\r\n     lying empty. The High Court deprecated the inaction on the part of the\r\n     Government of Bihar in not implementing the judgment of this Court  in\r\n     Ram Vinay Kumar\'s Case, on one pretext or the other, thereby  creating\r\n     a human rights problem in denying a  young  generation  its  right  to\r\n     basic education. According to the High Court, the solution was  simple\r\n     viz. to follow the judgment of this Court in Ram  Vinay  Kumar\'s  case\r\n     from where the circumstances has been left out. The  High  Court  also\r\n     calculated the number of existing  vacancies  in  the  manner  already\r\n     pointed out above.  On this basis direction was given to carry out the\r\n     selection process as per the mandate of this Court  contained  in  the\r\n     case of Ram Vinay Kumar.\r\n     6.     The State of Bihar challenged the aforesaid  judgment  of  High\r\n     Court by filing  Special  Leave  Petitions  in  this  Court.  However,\r\n     thereafter affidavit dated 18.1.2006 was filed by the Commissioner-cum-\r\n     Secretary, Education Department,  Government  of  Bihar  alongwith  an\r\n     application for withdrawal of those Special Leave  Petitions.  In  the\r\n     affidavit an undertaking was given that  only  trained  teachers  were\r\n     appointed as Assistant teachers in the State of Bihar.  Further  owing\r\n     to the reason that the number of available teachers in  the  State  of\r\n     Bihar were less than the available sanctioned post  and  no  test  for\r\n     selection was required. On the basis of this affidavit,  orders  dated\r\n     23.1.2006 were  passed  permitting  the  Government  to  withdraw  the\r\n     Special Leave Petitions.\r\n     7.     When the undertaking  given  in  the  said  affidavit  was  not\r\n     implemented  immediately  thereafter,  some  persons  filed   Contempt\r\n     Petition No. 207 of 2006 in this Court which was disposed of by orders\r\n     dated 19.3.2007 with a direction to the State of  Bihar  to  implement\r\n     its undertaking.\r\n            Operative part of the said order reads as under:\r\n              In paragraph 17 of the said affidavit in reply dated  7.2.2007,\r\n           it is stated that priority has been given to trained teachers in\r\n           appointment and only if trained teachers are  not  available  in\r\n           sufficient  numbers,  the  case  of   untrained   teachers   are\r\n           considered by the concerned  by  the  Panchayati  Raj  Institute\r\n           (PRI) to achieve the constitutional goal of free and  compulsory\r\n           education for children from age 6-14, and  in  this  regard  the\r\n           State of Bihar and other  answering  respondents  are  complying\r\n           with the orders of the High Court and  also  of  this  Court.  A\r\n           rejoinder has also been filed by the  petitioner  disputing  the\r\n           statements made by the State of Bihar  in  the  affidavit  dated\r\n           7.2.2007.\r\n                 In view of the categorical statement  now  made  that  the\r\n           priority will be given to the trained  teachers  in  appointment\r\n           and also the clarification made  in  paragraphs  19  to  222  of\r\n           aforesaid affidavit dated 7.2.2007, we direct the State of Bihar\r\n           to implement the undertaking given by the State of Bihar earlier\r\n           and also now by the present affidavit dated 7.2.2007  in  letter\r\n           and spirit by appointing the trained teachers on priority basis.\r\n                 The Contempt Petition is disposed of accordingly.   \r\n\r\n\r\n     8.     Still this undertaking was  not  complied  with  which  led  to\r\n     filing of another Contempt  Petition  No.  297  of  2007  titled  Nand\r\n     Kishore Ojha v. Anjani Kumar Singh  in which following interim  orders\r\n     dated 9.12.2009 were passed.\r\n              Accordingly, without issuing a Rule of Contempt, we direct that\r\n           the 34,540 vacancies shown as  available  in  the  advertisement\r\n           published in December, 2003,  be  filled  up  from  amongst  the\r\n           trained teachers who are available, in order  of  seniority.  As\r\n           indicated above, this is to be done on a one-time basis and must\r\n           not be taken as the regular practice to be followed.\r\n           Let the Contempt Petition be adjourned for a further  period  of\r\n           six weeks to enable the State Government to implement this order\r\n           and to submit a report on the next date as to the result of  the\r\n           discussions  held  between  the  petitioner  and  the  concerned\r\n           authorities.   \r\n\r\n\r\n     9.     Thereafter, the State of Bihar filled up  the  vacant  post  of\r\n     Assistant Teachers in terms of its undertaking thereby recruiting from\r\n     amongst the trained teachers who had applied earlier, pursuant to  the\r\n     advertisement given in the year 1991. Many had become over aged in the\r\n     meantime, and age relaxation was given in their cases.\r\n     10.    What is narrated above is the  history  of  litigation  in  the\r\n     State of  Bihar.  In  so  far  as  State  of  Jharkhand  is  concerned\r\n     (respondent herein),  as  already  pointed  out  above,  approximately\r\n     21,000 vacant post were transferred  to  this  State.  The  respondent\r\n     advertised these vacancies in the year 2002 by  giving  relaxation  in\r\n     age by 5 years only. Because of this reason many trained teachers,  in\r\n     which category of the petitioners include, could not be  appointed  as\r\n     Assistant Teachers, being overage. The petitioners, in this  backdrop,\r\n     contend that they are entitled to the benefit  of  Ram  Vinay  Kumar\'s\r\n     judgment of this Court  rendered  much  before  the  creation  of  the\r\n     Jharkhand State and applied to the erstwhile  unified  Bihar  and  the\r\n     judgment be implemented in their case as well as it has  happened  qua\r\n     the trained teachers in State of Bihar in the manner explained  above.\r\n     We may point out  at  this  stage  that  respondent  State  is  making\r\n     appointment only from amongst trained teachers. The problem,  however,\r\n     has arisen because fo the reason that these  petitioners  have  become\r\n     over aged and wanted total age relaxation. To put it, succinctly  they\r\n     are claiming parity with their counterparts in the State of Bihar  and\r\n     submitting that when those  teachers  were  appointed  by  giving  age\r\n     relaxation, there is no reason to deprive  the  petitioners  from  the\r\n     same treatment which would, otherwise, be discriminatory and violative\r\n     of Article 14 of the Constitution.\r\n     11.    The petitioners have pointed out that the respondent-State  had\r\n     set up a Committee in the year 2001 for implementation of the judgment\r\n     and even the said Committee in its report dated 31.5.2001  recommended\r\n     that all vacancies in the State of Jharkhand be  filled  with  trained\r\n     teachers  within  two  months.  The  operative  portion  of  the  said\r\n     recommendation reads as under:\r\n              Since the Government at its own  level  have  imparted  teacher\r\n           training to the thousands and the trained teachers were  in  the\r\n           hope for the two decades  that  they  will  be  appointed  as  a\r\n           teacher.  It  is  totally  unjustified  and  in-human  that  the\r\n           Government appoints untrained persons  and  thereby  ruined  the\r\n           future of trained teachers. Therefore,  the  committee  here  by\r\n           recommends that all the vacancies in the State of  Jharkhand  be\r\n           fulfill with trained teachers within  2  months.  If  number  of\r\n           trained teachers exceeds  the  number  of  vacancies,  then  the\r\n           vacancies be fulfilled on the basis of seniority of the  trained\r\n           teachers  i.e.  in  the  order  of   their   getting   training.\r\n           Thereafter,  the  trained  teachers   remained   unemployed   be\r\n           appointed  against  subsequent  vacancies.  In  the  appointment\r\n           process the  All the petitioners, in the Writ Petitions filed under&nbsp;Article 32&nbsp;of the Constitution of India, are similarly situated. After getting the requisite training they have acquired the nomenclature of \'trained teachers\'. They seek an appointments in the schools run by the Respondent-State of Jharkhand as assistant teachers. Some IAs filed by several similarly situated teachers for impleadment and seeking the same relief. It is for this reason that these petitions were conjointly heard.The direction was to conduct a special selection for filling up of the unfilled posts from amongst the applicants who had already submitted their applications pursuant to the advertisement issued and it was to be confined to those applicants who were possessing teachers training/ qualification obtained from Government/ private teachers\' training institution i.e. from amongst the trained teachers.&nbsp;The High Court deprecated the inaction on the part of the Government of Bihar in not implementing the judgment of this Court .The High Court also calculated the number of existing vacancies .The State of Bihar challenged the aforesaid judgment of High Court by filing Special Leave Petitions in this Court.Thereafter, the State of Bihar filled up the vacant post of Assistant Teachers in terms of its undertaking thereby recruiting from amongst the trained teachers who had applied earlier, pursuant to the advertisement given in the year 1991. Many had become over aged in the meantime, and age relaxation was given in their cases.Having regard to the above it would not be permissible to the petitioners to compare their case with their counterparts in Bihar. As far as the counterparts in the State of Bihar are concerned they had filed writ petitions well in time i.e. way back in the year 2003 in Patna High Court wherein those persons succeeded. The Patna High Court allowed those writ petitions vide judgment dated 1.7.2004 directing the State of Bihar to implement the judgment in Ram Vinay Kumar\'s Case. In such circumstances this Court would not be inclined to grant any relief to the petitioners in these petitions filed under&nbsp;Article 32&nbsp;of the Constitution, more so when it is found that the respondent/ State of Jharkhand has taken steps in conformity with the statutory recruitment rules framed under proviso to&nbsp;Article 309&nbsp;of the Constitution.Finding no merits in these writ petitions, same were dismissed. All pending I.As also stand dismissed. I.As Disposed','Punjab State Warehousing Corp Vs Bhushan Chander & Anr Dipak Misra, J.\r\n\r\n\r\n      The singular question that has emanated in  this  appeal,  by  special\r\nleave, is whether the High  Court  has  correctly  accepted  the  submission\r\nadvanced on behalf of the first respondent, who was convicted  for  offences\r\npunishable under Section 409/467/468/471 of  the  Indian  Penal  Code,  1860\r\n(for short,    IPC   ) and had been awarded sentence for each  of  the  offences\r\nwith the stipulation that they would run  concurrently,  that  he  being  an\r\nemployee of the appellant Corporation is a public servant and the trial  had\r\ncommenced without obtaining sanction  under  Section  197  of  the  Code  of\r\nCriminal Procedure, 1973  (CrPC)  and  hence,  the  trial  in  entirety  was\r\ninvalid and as a result the conviction  and  sentence  deserved  to  be  set\r\naside.\r\n2.    As far as the factual narration is  concerned,  suffice  it  to  state\r\nthat the Managing Director of  the  Corporation  had  written  a  letter  on\r\n28.6.1989 to the concerned police authority to register a case  against  the\r\nfirst respondent for offences punishable under Sections 409/467/468 and  471\r\nof  the  IPC  or  any  other   appropriate   provision   of   law.    During\r\ninvestigation, the investigating agency  found  that  the  accused  who  was\r\nworking as a Godown Assistant in  the  Corporation  had  misappropriated  11\r\ngunny bales value of which was Rs.38,841/-; that he had  tampered  with  the\r\nrecord of the department; and accordingly the police authorities  filed  the\r\ncharge-sheet for the  aforesaid  offences  before  the  court  of  competent\r\nJudicial Magistrate.  The  learned  Magistrate  on  the  basis  of  evidence\r\nbrought on record, found that the prosecution had been able  to  bring  home\r\nthe guilt against the  accused  and  accordingly  sentenced  him  to  suffer\r\nrigorous imprisonment for three years under Section 467 and 409 IPC and  two\r\nyears under Section 468/471 IPC with separate default clauses. The  judgment\r\nof conviction and order of  sentence  was  assailed  in  appeal  before  the\r\nlearned Session Judge, Firozpur and the matter  was  finally  heard  by  the\r\nlearned Additional Session Judge, who appreciating the evidence  on  record,\r\nconcurred with the conviction but  modified  the  sentence  of  three  years\r\nimposed under Section 409 and 467 IPC to two years.\r\n3.    Being dissatisfied, the first respondent preferred  Criminal  Revision\r\nNo. 359/2001 in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh.   Before\r\nthe revisional court, the only contention that was raised pertained to  non-\r\nobtaining of sanction under Section 197 CrPC.   It  was  argued  before  the\r\nlearned Single Judge that in view of the decisions in State  of  Maharashtra\r\nv. Dr. Budhikota Subbarao[1], Rakesh Kumar Mishra  v.  State  of  Bihar  and\r\nothers[2], Sankaran Moitra v. Sadhna Das and another[3],  Om  Kumar  Dhankar\r\nv. State of Haryana[4], the requisite sanction  having  not  been  obtained,\r\nthe trial was vitiated.  On behalf of the Corporation as well as  the  State\r\nof Punjab, it was argued that the sanction under Section 197  CrPC  was  not\r\nnecessary to prosecute the first respondent and  to  substantiate  the  said\r\nstand, reliance was  placed  on  Dr.  Lakshmansingh  Himatsingh  Vaghela  v.\r\nNaresh Kumar Chadrrashanker Jah[5], N. Bhargavan Pillai (dead) by  Lrs.  and\r\nanother v. State of Kerala[6],   State  of  U.P.  v.  Paras  Nath  Singh[7],\r\nRaghunath Anant Govilkar v. State of Maharashtra[8]  and  Choudhury  Parveen\r\nSultana v. State of West Bengal[9].\r\n4.    The learned Single Judge referred to the charges framed under  Section\r\n409 and 467 IPC.  He also referred  to  the  authorities  in  Prakash  Singh\r\nBadal v. State of Punjab[10], Nirmal Singh Kahlon v.  State  of  Punjab[11],\r\nOm Kumar Dhankar (supra) and Bakshish Singh  Brar  v.  Gurmel  Kaur[12]  and\r\nanalyzing Section 197 CrPC observed that the  said  provision  is  meant  to\r\nprotect responsible public servants against  the  institution  of  vexatious\r\ncriminal proceedings for offences alleged to have been  committed  by  them.\r\nThe learned Single Judge referred to P. Arulswami v.  State  of  Madras[13],\r\nMatajog Dube v.  H.C.  Bahri[14],  P.K.  Pradhan  v.  State  of  Sikkim[15],\r\nreproduced a passage from B. Saha v. M.S. Kochar[16], and came  to  hold  as\r\nfollows:-\r\n   So far as the commission of offence in this case  is  concerned,  the  very\r\nallegation would clearly reveal that it is not a case where the  allegations\r\nare in any other capacity than a public  servant.   The  allegation  against\r\nthe petitioner is that while being a public  servant,  he  had  committed  a\r\ncriminal breach of trust.  It is only in the  performance  of  the  official\r\nduty that the  petitioner  is  alleged  to  have  been  found  with  certain\r\ndeficiencies for which allegation of criminal breach of trust  as  well  has\r\nbeen made against him.  Certainly the facts in this  case  are  inextricably\r\nmingled with the official duty of the petitioner to be considered  severable\r\nto call for dispensing with the requirement of sanction   .\r\n\r\n5.    After so stating, the revisional court distinguished the  decision  in\r\nParas Nath Singh (supra)  which  was  relied  upon  by  the  prosecution  by\r\nstating thus:-\r\n   The aggrieved  person  in  the  said  case  has  faced  trial  for  alleged\r\ncommission of the offences punishable under Section 409, 420,  461  and  468\r\nIPC.  The Supreme Court in  this  case  has  drawn  difference  between  the\r\nofficial duty and doing something by public servant in  the  course  of  his\r\nservice.  It is observed that the section does  not  extend  its  protective\r\ncover to act or omission done by a public servant in service, but  restricts\r\nits scope of operation to only those acts or omissions, which are done by  a\r\npublic servant in discharge of official duty.  Even this observation of  the\r\nHon   ble Supreme Court would fully apply to the facts of  the  present  case.\r\nHere, the petitioner is alleged to have committed this offence not  only  as\r\na public servant but is stated to have done so in discharge of his  official\r\nduty.   In discharge of his official duty, the petitioner  was  required  to\r\nprotect stock, which he failed to do so and so he is asked  to  account  for\r\nthe same   .\r\n\r\n6.    The eventual conclusion recorded by the learned  Single  Judge  is  to\r\nthe following effect:-\r\n   Under normal circumstances, the offence under Sections 467/468/471 IPC  may\r\nbe of such a nature that requirement of  obtaining  sanction  under  Section\r\n197 CrPC may not be called for.  The offences in this case have been  inter-\r\nconnected with  the  main  offence  alleged  against  the  petitioner  under\r\nSection 409 IPC and it would clearly indicate that these offences could  not\r\nbe separately treated or dealt  with.   Requirement  of  obtaining  sanction\r\nwould be needed for an offence under Section 409 IPC and the  same  may  not\r\nbe separated from the remaining offences   .\r\n\r\n7.    After so stating, the learned Single Judge ruled that the  Corporation\r\nis a fully government-owned  and  financed  by  the  State  Government  and,\r\ntherefore, he is a public servant as per the definition  of  Section  21  of\r\nIPC and, therefore, his employment in the Corporation would confer  him  the\r\nstatus of public servant for which sanction is  necessary.   The  revisional\r\ncourt has not adverted to any of the aspects touching  merits  of  the  case\r\nand, therefore, we refrain from entering into the said arena.\r\n8.    Section 197(1) and  (2)  CrPC  which  are  relevant  for  the  present\r\npurpose are reproduced below:-\r\n   197. Prosecution of Judges and public servants.   (1) When any person who  is\r\nor was a Judge or Magistrate or a public  servant  not  removable  from  his\r\noffice save by or with the sanction of the  Government  is  accused  of  any\r\noffence alleged to have been committed by him while acting or purporting  to\r\nact in the discharge of his official duty, no court  shall  take  cognizance\r\nof such  offence  except  with  the  previous  sanction  save  as  otherwise\r\nprovided in the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013   \r\n\r\n(a) in the case of a person who is employed or, as the case may be,  was  at\r\nthe time of commission of the alleged offence employed, in  connection  with\r\nthe affairs of the Union, of the Central Government;\r\n\r\n(b) in the case of a person who is employed or, as the case may be,  was  at\r\nthe time of commission of the alleged offence employed, in  connection  with\r\nthe affairs of a State, of the State Government:\r\n\r\nProvided that where the alleged offence was committed by a  person  referred\r\nto in clause (b) during the period while a proclamation issued under  clause\r\n(1) of Article 356 of the Constitution was in force in a State,  clause  (b)\r\nwill apply as if for the expression    State  Government     occurring  therein,\r\nthe expression    Central Government    were substituted.\r\n\r\nExplanation.   For the removal  of  doubts  it  is  hereby  declared  that  no\r\nsanction shall be required in case  of  a  public  servant  accused  of  any\r\noffence alleged to have been committed under Section 166-A,  Section  166-B,\r\nSection 354, Section 354-A, Section 354-B,  Section  354-C,  Section  354-D,\r\nSection 370,  Section  375,  Section  376,  Section  376-A,  Section  376-C,\r\nSection 376-D or Section 509 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860).\r\n\r\n(2)   No Court shall take cognizance of any offence  alleged  to  have  been\r\ncommitted by any member of the Armed Forces of the  Union  while  acting  or\r\npurporting to act in the discharge of his official  duty,  except  with  the\r\nprevious sanction of the Central Government.   \r\n\r\n9.    In Matajog Dube (supra), certain complaints were alleged  against  the\r\nauthorized  officials  on  the  ground  that  the  officials  had  committed\r\noffences  punishable  under  Sections  323,  341,  342  and  109  IPC.   The\r\nofficials were arrayed as accused persons who were authorized to search  two\r\npremises in question.  The trial Magistrate discharged the  accused  persons\r\nfor want of sanction under Section 197 CrPC.  Similar order  was  passed  by\r\nanother trial Magistrate.  Both the orders were concurred with by  the  High\r\nCourt.  Be it noted two cases had arisen as two complaints were  filed.   It\r\nwas contended before  this  Court  that  the  act  of  criminal  assault  or\r\nwrongful confinement can never be regarded  as  act  done  while  acting  or\r\npurporting to act in the  discharge  of  official  duty  and  that  duty  is\r\nclearly defined in the statute.  The  Constitution  Bench  referred  to  two\r\ndecisions  of  the  Federal  Court  and  the  decisions  of  this  Court  in\r\nShreekantiah Ramayya Munipalli v. State of Bombay[17]  and  Amrik  Singh  v.\r\nState of Pepsu[18] and analyzing the earlier authorities opined that:-\r\n   The result of foregoing discussion is this:  There  must  be  a  reasonable\r\nconnection between the act and the discharge of official duty; the act  must\r\nbear such relation to the duty that the accused could lay a  reasonable  but\r\nnot a pretended or fanciful claim, that he did  it  in  the  course  of  the\r\nperformance of his duty   .\r\n\r\n10.   Thereafter, the  Court  adverted  to  the  determination  of  need  of\r\nsanction and the relevant  stage.   We  are  not  concerned  with  the  said\r\naspects in the present case.\r\n11.    In  Arulswami  (supra),  the  President  of  a  Panchayat  Board  was\r\nconvicted under Section 409 IPC by the High Court which had  overturned  the\r\ndecision of the lower court.  It was argued before the High Court  that  the\r\nprosecution  was  not  maintainable  for  want  of  sanction  by  the  State\r\nGovernment under Section 106 of the Madras Village Panchayats  Act   (Madras\r\nAct X of 1950).  The High Court held that no sanction of the Government  was\r\nnecessary as the appellant had ceased to hold the office of  the  President,\r\nwhen the prosecution was launched and  further  that  the  sanction  of  the\r\nCollector was sufficient in law.  That apart, this Court posed the  question\r\nwhether the sanction of the Government under Section 106 of the  Madras  Act\r\nwas necessary for the prosecution of the appellant  for  the  offence  under\r\nSection 409 IPC.  To appreciate the contention raised,  the  Court  referred\r\nto Section 197 CrPC.  The three-Judge Bench referred  to  the  decisions  in\r\nHori Ram Singh v. Emperor[19] and H.H.B. Gill v. The King[20].   The  three-\r\nJudge Bench quoted the observations of Lord  Simonds  made  in  H.H.B.  Gill\r\n(supra) in approving the statement of law made in Hori Ram  Singh   (supra).\r\nThe Court also took note of the  fact  that  the  decision  in  H.H.B.  Gill\r\n(supra) had been approved in Albert West Meads v.  The  King[21],  Phanindra\r\nChandra v. The King[22] and R. W. Mathams v. State of  West  Bengal[23]  and\r\neventually held:-\r\n   It is not therefore every  offence  committed  by  a  public  servant  that\r\nrequires sanction for prosecution under S. 197(1) of the Criminal  Procedure\r\nCode; nor even every act done by him while he is  actually  engaged  in  the\r\nperformance of his  official  duties;  but  if  the  act  complained  of  is\r\ndirectly concerned with his official  duties  so  that,  if  questioned,  it\r\ncould be claimed to have been done by virtue of the  office,  then  sanction\r\nwould be necessary.  It is the quality of the act that is important  and  if\r\nit falls within the scope and range of his official  duties  the  protection\r\ncontemplated by S. 197 of the Criminal Procedure  Code  will  be  attracted.\r\nAn office may be entirely unconnected with the official duty as such  or  it\r\nmay be committed within the  scope  of  the  official  duty.   Where  it  is\r\nunconnected with the official duty there can be no protection   .\r\n12.   The Court while arriving at the said conclusion also  placed  reliance\r\non Om Prakash Gupta v. State of U.P.[24] and ultimately came  to  hold  that\r\nthe sanction of the Government is  not  necessary  for  prosecution  of  the\r\naccused under Section 409 IPC.\r\n13.   The aforesaid two authorities  make  it  clear  that  no  sanction  is\r\nneeded to launch the prosecution for the offence  punishable  under  Section\r\n409 IPC.  As we notice from the impugned judgment, the learned Single  Judge\r\nhas been swayed away by what has been stated in B.  Saha  (supra).   In  the\r\nsaid  case,  the  appellants  had  sought  discharge  on  the  ground   that\r\ncognizance of the complaint had been taken without obtaining sanction  under\r\nSection 197 CrPC and Section 155 of the Customs Act, 1962.   The  Magistrate\r\nhad accepted the objection relying on the decision in  Shreekantiah  Ramayya\r\nMunipalli (supra).  The said order was challenged by the complainant  before\r\nthe High Court and the learned  Single  Judge,  after  elaborate  discussion\r\nopined that no sanction was required for the  prosecution  of  the  accused-\r\nappellants for the offence under Sections 120-B/409 IPC  because  they  were\r\ncertainly not acting in the discharge of their official  duties,  when  they\r\nmisappropriated the goods.  The three-Judge Bench analyzing  the  ambit  and\r\nscope of Section 197 CrPC opined that the  words     any  offence  alleged  to\r\nhave been committed by  him  while  acting  or  purporting  to  act  in  the\r\ndischarge of his official duty    employed in Section 197(1) of the Code,  are\r\ncapable of a narrow as well as a wide interpretation.   If  the  said  words\r\nare  construed  too  narrowly,  the  section  will  be  rendered  altogether\r\nsterile, for,    it is no part of an official duty to commit an  offence,  and\r\nnever can be   . The Court proceeded to observe that in the wider  sense,  the\r\nsaid words  will  take  under  their  umbrella  every  act  constituting  an\r\noffence, committed in the course  of  the  same  transaction  in  which  the\r\nofficial duty is performed  or  purports  to  be  performed  and  the  right\r\napproach to the import of these  words  lies  between  these  two  extremes.\r\nWhile on the one hand, it  is  not  every  offence  committed  by  a  public\r\nservant while engaged in the performance of  his  official  duty,  which  is\r\nentitled to the  protection  of  Section  197(1),  an  act  constituting  an\r\noffence, directly and reasonably  connected  with  his  official  duty  will\r\nrequire sanction for  prosecution  under  the  said  provision.   The  Court\r\nreferred to the observations of Ramaswami,  J.,  in  Baijnath  v.  State  of\r\nM.P.[25], which is to the following effect:-\r\n   it is the quality of the act that is important, and if it falls within  the\r\nscope and range of his  official  duties,  the  protection  contemplated  by\r\nSection 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code will be attracted   .\r\n\r\n      After  The Managing Director of the Corporation had written a letter on 28.6.1989 to the concerned police authority to register a case against the first respondent for offences punishable under&nbsp;Sections 409/467/468&nbsp;and&nbsp;471&nbsp;of the IPC or any other appropriate provision of law. During investigation, the investigating agency found that the accused who was working as a Godown Assistant in the Corporation had misappropriated 11 gunny bales value of which was Rs.38,841/-; that he had tampered with the record of the department; and accordingly the police authorities filed the charge-sheet for the aforesaid offences before the court of competent Judicial Magistrate. The learned Magistrate on the basis of evidence brought on record, found that the prosecution had been able to bring home the guilt against the accused and accordingly sentenced him to suffer rigorous imprisonment for three years under&nbsp;Section 467&nbsp;and&nbsp;409&nbsp;IPC and two years under&nbsp;Section 468/471&nbsp;IPC with separate default clauses. The judgment of conviction and order of sentence was assailed in appeal before the learned Session Judge, Firozpur and the matter was finally heard by the learned Additional Session Judge, who appreciating the evidence on record, concurred with the conviction but modified the sentence of three years imposed under&nbsp;Section 409&nbsp;and&nbsp;467&nbsp;IPC to two years.Being dissatisfied, the first respondent preferred Criminal Revision No. 359/2001 in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh. Before the revisional court, the only contention that was raised pertained to non- obtaining of sanction under&nbsp;Section 197&nbsp;CrPC.The Supreme Court in the case had drawn difference between the official duty and doing something by public servant in the course of his service.&nbsp;Here, the petitioner was alleged to have committed the offence not only as a public servant but was stated to have done so in discharge of his official duty. In discharge of his official duty, the petitioner was required to protect stock, which he failed to do so and so he was asked to account for the sameâ€.In view of the aforesaid analysis, the irresistible conclusion was that the respondents were not entitled to have the protective umbrella of&nbsp;Section 197&nbsp;CrPC and, therefore, the High Court has erred in setting aside the conviction and sentence on the ground that the trial is vitiated in the absence of sanction. Consequently, Supreme Court allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment and order passed by the High Court and remit the matter to the High Court to decide the revision petition in accordance with law. Appeals Allowed','M/S. Techno Shares & Stocks Ltd Vs Commissioner Of Income Tax-Iv S.H. KAPADIA, CJI\r\n\r\n1.    Leave granted.\r\n\r\n2.    In this batch of cases the question which arises for\r\n\r\ndetermination       is:   whether    BSE    Membership           Card   can   be\r\n\r\nconsidered     an    intangible         asset   for        the    purpose      of\r\n\r\ndepreciation    under      Section      32(1)(ii)     of    the    Income     Tax\r\n\r\nAct, 1961 (for short \"the 1961 Act\")?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFacts in M/s Techno Shares &amp; Stocks Ltd. [Lead matter]\r\n\r\n3.    In this case, we are concerned with the Assessment\r\n\r\nYears 1999-2000, 2000-2001, 2001-2002 and 2002-2003. The\r\n\r\nassessee   company        filed   its    Return     of     income       for   the\r\n \r\n\r\nAssessment      Year    1999-2000         disclosing     a    loss      of    Rs.\r\n\r\n10,77,276/-. The return was processed under Section 143(1)\r\n\r\non November 8, 2000. The case stood reopened under Section\r\n\r\n147 and Notice u/s 148 stood issued to the assessee on\r\n\r\n16.7.2002. The assessee filed its return of income under\r\n\r\nprotest. The assessee filed its return of income pursuant\r\n\r\nto the Notice u/s 148 once again declaring loss of Rs.\r\n\r\n10,77,276/-, the same as was in the original return of\r\n\r\nincome. The main reason for reopening of assessment under\r\n\r\nSection 147 was the claim of depreciation by the assessee\r\n\r\non BSE membership card amounting to Rs. 23,65,000/-. The\r\n\r\nclaim of depreciation of the assessee was based on Section\r\n\r\n32(1)(ii) which stood inserted by Finance (No. 2) Act,\r\n\r\n1998 w.e.f. 1.4.1999. However, the said Section deals with\r\n\r\nclaim    for   depreciation          of   items   acquired    on       or    after\r\n\r\n1.4.1998.      The assessee claimed before the A.O. that the\r\n\r\nBSE     membership     card    is     a    \"licence\"     or   \"business         or\r\n\r\ncommercial right of similar nature\" u/s 32(1)(ii) and is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, an intangible asset eligible for depreciation\r\n\r\nu/s 32(1)(ii) which submission was not accepted by the\r\n\r\nA.O.      It   was   held     that    membership    is   only      a   personal\r\n\r\npermission which is non-transferable and which does not\r\n\r\ndevolve automatically on legal heirs and, therefore, it is\r\n \r\n\r\nnot a privately owned asset.               That, there is no ownership\r\n\r\nof an asset and that what ultimately can be sold is only a\r\n\r\nRight to Nomination.           Further, according to the A.O., in\r\n\r\nthe case of BSE membership, there is no obsolescence, wear\r\n\r\nand tear or diminution in value by its use, hence, the\r\n\r\nassessee     was   not     entitled        to    claim     depreciation            u/s\r\n\r\n32(1)(ii).     This decision of the A.O. stood affirmed by\r\n\r\nC.I.T. (A) in the appeal filed by the assessee.\r\n\r\n4.    Aggrieved      by    the      said    decision       of    CIT    (A),       the\r\n\r\nassessee   carried       the   matter      in    appeal    to    the        Tribunal\r\n\r\nwhich took the view that since the assessee had acquired a\r\n\r\nright to trade on the floor of BSE through the membership\r\n\r\ncard, it was not entitled to depreciation u/s 32(1)(ii) of\r\n\r\nthe 1961 Act.        That, the said Card is a capital asset\r\n\r\nthrough    which   right       to   trade       on   the   floor       of    BSE    is\r\n\r\nacquired     and   since       it   is     intangible       asset       the     said\r\n\r\nassessee was entitled to depreciation u/s 32(1)(ii).\r\n\r\n5.    Against the said decision, the Department carried\r\n\r\nthe matter in appeal to the High Court which came to the\r\n\r\nconclusion,    following        certain     decisions       of     this       Court,\r\n\r\nthat the BSE membership card is only a personal privilege\r\n\r\ngranted to a member to trade in shares on the floor of the\r\n\r\nStock Exchange; that, such a privilege cannot be equated\r\n \r\n\r\nwith the expression \"licence\" or \"any other business or\r\n\r\ncommercial rights of similar nature\" u/s 32(1)(ii); that,\r\n\r\nthere     is    a   difference       between    acquiring       a    know-how,\r\n\r\npatent, copyright or trademark and acquiring a licence to\r\n\r\nuse     such     know-how,     patent,     copyright,       trademark         or\r\n\r\nfranchise;       that   the   expression       \"business    or      commercial\r\n\r\nrights of similar nature\" in Section 32(1)(ii) of the 1961\r\n\r\nAct   would      take   its    colour    from    the    preceding         words,\r\n\r\nnamely,        know-how,      patent,    copyright,        trademark         and\r\n\r\nfranchise which belong to a class of intellectual property\r\n\r\nrights and applying the rule of ejusdem generis, the High\r\n\r\nCourt held that the expression \"licence\" as well as the\r\n\r\nexpression       \"business     and    commercial       rights       of   similar\r\n\r\nnature\" in Section 32(1)(ii) of the 1961 Act are referable\r\n\r\nto IPRs such as know-how, patent, copyright, trademark and\r\n\r\nfranchise and since the BSE membership card does not fall\r\n\r\nin any of the above categories, the claim for depreciation\r\n\r\nwas not admissible on the BSE membership card acquired by\r\n\r\nthe   assessee      u/s    32(1)(ii).     Consequently,         the      appeals\r\n\r\nfiled by the Department stood allowed, hence, these civil\r\n\r\nappeals.\r\n\r\nImportance of BSE:\r\n\r\n6.       BSE is recognized by the Government of India under\r\n \r\n\r\nSecurities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956. Approximately\r\n\r\n70000 deals are executed on a daily basis. There are about\r\n\r\n3500     companies    which     are    listed    on   BSE.     The     market\r\n\r\ncapitalization of the BSE is Rs. 5 trillion. The main aim\r\n\r\nand object of the BSE is to provide a market place for the\r\n\r\npurchase    and   sale     of   securities.      It   aims     to    promote,\r\n\r\ndevelop and maintain a well regulated market for dealing\r\n\r\nin   securities      and   to   safeguard       the   interests       of    the\r\n\r\nmembers and the investing public having dealings in the\r\n\r\nExchange. It helps industrial development of the country\r\n\r\nthrough resources mobilization. It is set up to establish\r\n\r\nand promote \"just practices\" in securities transactions.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1996, the BSE constituted a Trade Guarantee\r\n\r\nScheme    under    which    all    trades    carried     out    on     online\r\n\r\ntrading    are    guaranteed      by   the   clearing    house       of    BSE.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, a depository has been set up as a joint venture\r\n\r\nbetween BSE and Bank of India etc. BSE has introduced\r\n\r\ntrading also in fixed income securities to give impetus to\r\n\r\ntrading in debentures and corporate debt instruments to\r\n\r\nincrease trading in Government owned securities.\r\n\r\nQuestion arising in the Present Matters:\r\n\r\n7.     Is depreciation allowable on the cost of a Stock\r\n\r\n       Exchange Membership Card under Section 32(1)(ii)\r\n \r\n\r\n     of the Income Tax Act, 1961, which was enacted and\r\n\r\n     inserted by Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnswer to the above Question:\r\n\r\n8.

It is relevant  to point out that the acquisition \r\n\r\n              proceedings under the Act, are based on the principal of \r\n\r\n              eminent   domain   and   the   only   protection   given   to   the \r\n\r\n              person   whose   land   is   sought   to   be   acquired   is   an \r\n\r\n              opportunity under Section 5-A of the Act to convince the \r\n\r\n              enquiring authority that the purpose for which the land is \r\n\r\n              sought   to   be  acquired   is   in  fact   is   not   a  public   purpose \r\n\r\n              and is only purported to be one in the guise of a public \r\n\r\n              purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      It   is   relevant   to   mention   here   that   excluding   the \r\n\r\n              enquiry   under   Section   5-A   can   only   be   an   exception \r\n\r\n              where the urgency cannot brook any delay.  The enquiry \r\n\r\n              provides an opportunity to the owner of land to convince \r\n\r\n              the authorities concerned that the land in question is not \r\n\r\n              suitable for purpose for which it is sought to be acquired \r\n\r\n              or   the   same   sought   to   be   acquired   for   the   collateral \r\n\r\n              purposes.    It   is   pertinent   to   mention   here   that   the \r\n\r\n              respondents  No.  1  &amp;  2  without   the  application  of  mind \r\n\r\n              dispensed   with   the   enquiry   on   the   ground   of   urgency \r\n\r\n              invoking the power conferred by Section 17 (1) or (2) of \r\n\r\n              the   Act.     Further,   the   respondent   No.   1   &amp;   2   without \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplication of mind did not considered the survey report \r\n\r\nof the abadi of the village Makaura where the entire land \r\n\r\nis being used for the purpose of residence and grazing of \r\n\r\ncattle\'s in Khasra No. 394.  Further, the petitioners were \r\n\r\nsurprised to find that their land have not been included in \r\n\r\nthe   Abadi   irrespective   the   same   is   in   use   for   habitable \r\n\r\nand   keeping   the   cattle   and   other   uses.     The   petitioners \r\n\r\nhave   constructed   their   houses   and   using   the   same   for \r\n\r\ntheir   residence   and   keep   their   cattle\'s   and   agricultural \r\n\r\nproduce.    The   survey   report   clearly   shows   that   the \r\n\r\nimpugned Khasra  No. 394 is in use  for residence.    The \r\n\r\nreport in respect of the land in question falling in Khasra \r\n\r\nNo.   394   given   by   the   respondent   No.   4   vide \r\n\r\ncommunication   dated   26th  March,   2007   is   annexed   as \r\n\r\nAnnexure 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n16.     That   the   said   notification   under   Section   4   of   the \r\n\r\nAct   issued   by   the   respondent   No.   1   and   2   is   without \r\n\r\napplication   of   mind   and   there   was   no   urgency   in   the \r\n\r\nacquisition   of   land,   for   the   planned   industrial \r\n\r\ndevelopment, as the land, as per the master plan - 2021 \r\n\r\nthe   land   of   the   village   Makaura   is   reserved   for \r\n\r\n\"residential\"   of   which   the   respondent   No.   2   invoked \r\n\r\nSection 17 (1) and subsection 4 of the Act by dispensing \r\n\r\nwith an enquiry under Section 5A of the Act.   The said \r\n\r\naction   on   the   part   of   the   respondents   are   un-warranted \r\n\r\nand is in gross violation of Article 14,19, 21 and 300A of \r\n\r\nthe constitution.   The such illegal  act on the part of the \r\n\r\nrespondents show mala fide and their oblique motive to \r\n\r\ndeprive   the   owners   from  their   houses   in   order   to   fulfill \r\n\r\ntheir political obligations/promise to the private builders \r\n\r\nby   taking   the   shelter   of   section   17   of   the   Act   by \r\n\r\ndispensing with the enquiry under Section 5-A of the Act \r\n\r\nas well as overlooked purpose as stipulated in the Master \r\n\r\nPlan   2021   which   is   any   way   do   not   require   any   urgent \r\n\r\nattention. \r\n\r\n\r\nA.      That the whole acquisition proceedings   are void, \r\n\r\nunconstitutional,   tainted   with   mala   fide,   abuse   of \r\n\r\nauthority   and   power,   non-application   of   mind,   and   as \r\n\r\nsuch, liable to be quashed as violative of Articles 14,19 \r\n\r\nand 300-A of the Constitution of India. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            F.      That   the   purpose   stated   in   the   notification   under \r\n\r\n            Section   4   and   declaration   under   section   6   by   invoking \r\n\r\n            section   17   is   presently   non-existent   and   thus   the \r\n\r\n            notification   is   bad   in   law.   There   is   no   urgency   for   the \r\n\r\n            invocation   when   the   land   is   to   be   acquired   for   planned \r\n\r\n            development for the purpose of setting residential colony. \r\n\r\n            The impugned             notification   is   without   any   authority \r\n\r\n            of law and volatile of Article 300-A of the Constitution \r\n\r\n            of   India,   which   limits   the   power   to   acquire   land   to   the \r\n\r\n            authority under the Land Acquisition Act.  Therefore, the \r\n\r\n            notification in question is bad in law.\"\r\n\r\n                                                              (emphasis supplied)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7.    The  High  Court negatived  the  appellants\'   challenge  at the  threshold \r\n\r\n\r\nmainly on the ground that the averments contained in the petition were not \r\n\r\n\r\nsupported by a proper affidavit.  This is evident from the following portions \r\n\r\n\r\nof the impugned order:\r\n\r\n\r\n            \"Here the petitioners neither have pleaded that there exist \r\n\r\n            no material before  the State Government to come to the \r\n\r\n            conclusion that the enquiry under Section 5-A should be \r\n\r\n            dispensed with by invoking Section 17(4) of the Act nor \r\n\r\n            the learned counsel for the petitioners could place before \r\n\r\n            us   any   such   averment   in   the   writ   petition.   Though,   in \r\n\r\n            para-11 of the writ petition, an averment has been made \r\n\r\n            that the respondents no. 1 and 2 without the application \r\n\r\n            of   mind   dispensed   with   the   enquiry   on   the   ground   of \r\n\r\n            urgency  invoking the power conferred by Section  17(1) \r\n\r\n            or (2) of the Act, but in the affidavit, the said paragraph \r\n\r\n            has   been   sworn   on   the   basis   of   perusal   of   record. \r\n\r\n            Similarly   in   para   16   of   the   writ   petition,   the   only \r\n\r\n            averment contained therein is as under:\r\n\r\n\r\n            \"16. That the said notification under Section 4 of the \r\n\r\n            Act   issued   by   the   respondent   No.1   and   2   is   without \r\n\r\n            application of mind and there was no urgency in the \r\n\r\n            acquisition   of   land,   for   the   planned   industrial \r\n\r\n            development, as the land, as per the master plan-2021 \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               the   land   of   the   village   Makaura   is   reserved   for \r\n\r\n               \"residential\"   of   which   the   respondent   No.2   invoked \r\n\r\n               Section   17(1)   and   sub-section   4   of   the   Act   by \r\n\r\n               dispensing with an enquiry under Section 5-A of the \r\n\r\n               Act. The said action on the part of the respondents are \r\n\r\n               un-warranted   and   is   in   gross   violation   of   Article \r\n\r\n               14,19,21   and   300A   of   the   Constitution.     The   such \r\n\r\n               illegal   act   on  the   part   of  the  respondents   show   mala \r\n\r\n               fide   and   their   oblique   motive   to   deprive   the   owners \r\n\r\n               from   their   houses   in   order   to   fulfill   their   political \r\n\r\n               obligations/ promise to the private builders by taking \r\n\r\n               the shelter of Section 17 of the Act by dispensing with \r\n\r\n               the  enquiry  under Section   5-A  of the  Act as  well  as \r\n\r\n               overlooked   purpose   as   stipulated   in   the   Master   Plan \r\n\r\n               2021   which   is   any   way   do   not   require   any   urgent \r\n\r\n               attention.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n               However, in the affidavit, this para has not been sworn at \r\n\r\n               all   and   in   any   case   with   respect   to   dispensation   of \r\n\r\n               enquiry under Section 5-A by invoking  Section 17(4) of \r\n\r\n               the Act nothing has been said except that the exercise of \r\n\r\n               power is violative of Articles 14,19, 21 and 300-A of the \r\n\r\n               Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n               We, therefore, do not find any occasion even to call upon \r\n\r\n               the   respondents   to   file   a   counter   affidavit   placing   on \r\n\r\n               record,   the   material   if   any   for   exercising   power   under \r\n\r\n               Section   17(1)   and   (4)   of   the   Act   in   the   absence   of   any \r\n\r\n               relevant   pleading   or   material   and   the   question   of \r\n\r\n               requiring the respondents to produce the original record \r\n\r\n               in this regard also does not arise.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8.     The   High   Court   distinguished   the   judgment   of   this   Court   in  Om \r\n\r\n\r\nPrakash   v.   State   of   U.P.  (1998)   6   SCC   1,   albeit   without   assigning   any \r\n\r\n\r\ncogent   reason,   relied   upon   the   judgments   of   the   Division   Benches   in \r\n\r\n\r\nKshama Sahkari Avas Samiti Ltd. v. State of U.P.  2007 (1) AWC 327, \r\n\r\n\r\nJasraj Singh v. State of U.P. 2008 (8) ADJ 329 and Jagriti Sahkari Avas \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSamiti Ltd. Ghaziabad v. State of U.P. 2008 (9) ADJ 43 and held that the \r\n\r\n\r\ndecision of the Government to invoke Section 17(1) cannot be subjected to \r\n\r\n\r\njudicial   review.   The   High   Court   also   rejected   the   appellants\'   plea   that   in \r\n\r\n\r\nterms  of  the  policy  framed by  the   State   Government, the  land   covered   by \r\n\r\n\r\nabadi cannot be acquired by observing that no material has been placed on \r\n\r\n\r\nrecord   to   show   that   the   policy   framed   in   1991   was   still   continuing.     To \r\n\r\n\r\nbuttress   this   conclusion,   the   High   Court   relied   upon   the   judgment   of   this \r\n\r\n\r\nCourt in Anand Buttons Limited v. State of Haryana (2005) 9 SCC 164.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9.      By an order dated 29.10.2010, this Court, after taking cognizance of \r\n\r\n\r\nthe fact that the respondents did not get opportunity to file reply to the writ \r\n\r\n\r\npetition, directed them to do so. Thereupon, Shri Harnam Singh, Additional \r\n\r\n\r\nDistrict   Magistrate   (Land   Acquisition)/Officer   on   Special   Duty   (Land \r\n\r\n\r\nAcquisition) NOIDA, District Gautam Budh Nagar filed counter affidavit on \r\n\r\n\r\nbehalf   of   respondent   Nos.1   to   3.     In   paragraph   10   of   his   affidavit,   Shri \r\n\r\n\r\nHarnam  Singh   has   attempted   to   justify   invoking   of   the   urgency   clause   by \r\n\r\n\r\nmaking the following assertions:\r\n\r\n\r\n                \"That   in   invoking   the   urgency   clause   the   State \r\n\r\n                Government   has   taken   into   consideration   the   following \r\n\r\n                factors:-\r\n\r\n\r\n                i)      Greater   Noida   Industrial   Development   Authority \r\n\r\n                was   constituted   under   the   U.P.

The   acquired   land   was \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             urgently   required   by   the   Development   Authority   for \r\n\r\n             planned Industrial Development of the area.\r\n\r\n\r\n             ii)     That the land in the adjoining villages were already \r\n\r\n             acquired   by   the   Greater   Noida   Industrial   Development \r\n\r\n             Authority.  Thus, the acquired land was urgently required \r\n\r\n             for   continuity   of   infrastructure   services   and   planned \r\n\r\n             Industrial   Development   of   the   Area.     If,   the   proposed \r\n\r\n             land   was   not   acquired   immediately   and   delay   in   this \r\n\r\n             regard would lead to encroachments and would adversely \r\n\r\n             affect the Planned Industrial Development of the Area.\r\n\r\n\r\n             iii)    That   the   acquired   land   was   required   for   overall \r\n\r\n             development   i.e.   construction   of   roads,   laying   of \r\n\r\n             sewerages,   providing   electricity   etc.   in   the   area   and  the \r\n\r\n             said   scheme   has   been   duly   approved   by   the   state \r\n\r\n             government.\r\n\r\n\r\n             iv)     That   the   acquired   land   consists   of   246   plots \r\n\r\n             numbers with 392 recorded tenure holders.

Shri   Manoj   Kumar   Singh,   Tehsildar   filed   a   separate   affidavit   on \r\n\r\n\r\nbehalf of Respondent No.4 and justified the invoking of urgency clause by \r\n\r\n\r\nasserting that large tracts of land were acquired for industrial development \r\n\r\n\r\nof the district.  According to him, as per the policy of industrial development \r\n\r\n\r\nof   the   State   Government,   the   land   is   required   to   be   allotted   to   industrial \r\n\r\n\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\n\r\n11.     On   8.11.2010,  Shri   Dinesh   Dwivedi  learned   senior   counsel   for   the \r\n\r\n\r\nState   made   a   request   for   permission   to   file   additional   affidavit   with   some \r\n\r\n\r\ndocuments. His request was accepted.   Thereafter, the respondents filed an \r\n\r\n\r\naffidavit   of   Shri   Sushil   Kumar   Chaubey,   Tehsildar,   Land   Acquisition, \r\n\r\n\r\nGautam Budh Nagar along with eight documents of which seven have been \r\n\r\n\r\ncollectively marked as Annexure A-1.     The first of the documents marked \r\n\r\n\r\nAnnexure A-1 is copy of letter dated 25.2.2008 sent by the Commissioner \r\n\r\n\r\nand Director, Directorate of Land Acquisition, Revenue Board, U.P. to the \r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial   Secretary,   Industrial   Development   on   the   subject   of   issuance   of \r\n\r\n\r\nnotification   under   Sections   4   and   17   of   the   Act   for   acquisition   of   lands \r\n\r\n\r\nmeasuring 205.0288 hectares of village Makora.  The second document is an \r\n\r\n\r\nundated   letter   signed   by   Deputy   Chief   Executive   Officer,   Greater   Noida, \r\n\r\n\r\nCollector,  Gautam Budh Nagar and four other  officers/officials.    The  next \r\n\r\n\r\ndocument has been  described as comments/certificate on the issues raised in \r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment Order No.5261/77-4-06-251N/06 dated 21.12.2006 with regard \r\n\r\n\r\nto   proposal   for   acquisition   of   205.0288   hectares   lands   in   village   Makora. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis   document   is   accompanied   by   seven   forms   containing   various \r\n\r\n\r\nparticulars.  The third document is communication dated 29.10.2007 sent by \r\n\r\n\r\nthe   Commissioner,   Meerut   Division,   Meerut   to   the   District   Magistrate, \r\n\r\n\r\nGautam Budh Nagar conveying  the consent  of the Divisional Land Utility \r\n\r\n\r\nCommittee  for the acquisition of   lands of five villages including Makora. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter is accompanied by minutes of the meeting of the Divisional Land \r\n\r\n\r\nUtility Committee held on 29.10.2007.  The fifth document is form No.43A-\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  The sixth document is communication dated 22.2.2008 sent by Collector, \r\n\r\n\r\nLand Acquisition/Special Land Acquisition Officer, Greater Noida.  The last \r\n\r\n\r\ndocument which forms part of Annexure A-1 is form No.16 showing the list \r\n\r\n\r\nof properties having constructions etc.  Annexure A-2 is copy of letter dated \r\n\r\n\r\n31.10.2008   sent   by   the   Director,   Directorate   of   Land   Acquisition   to   the \r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial Secretary, Industrial Development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12.     Shri   N.P.Singh,   learned   counsel   for   the   appellants   argued   that   the \r\n\r\n\r\nimpugned   order   is   liable   to   be   set   aside   because   the   High   Court   failed   to \r\n\r\n\r\nconsider   the   issues   raised   in   the   writ   petition   in   a   correct   perspective. \r\n\r\n\r\nLearned counsel submitted that the appellants had specifically pleaded that \r\n\r\n\r\nthere was no valid ground to invoke the urgency clause contained in Section \r\n\r\n\r\n17(1) and to dispense with the application of Section 5-A but the High Court \r\n\r\n\r\ndid not even call upon the respondents to file counter affidavit and brushed \r\n\r\n\r\naside   the   challenge   to   the   acquisition   proceeding   on   a   wholly   untenable \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npremise  that  the  affidavit filed in support of the writ  petition was laconic. \r\n\r\n\r\nLearned counsel further argued that the purpose for which land was acquired \r\n\r\n\r\ni.e. planned industrial development of the district did not justify invoking of \r\n\r\n\r\nthe urgency provisions and denial of opportunity to the appellants and other \r\n\r\n\r\nland owners to file objections under Section 5-A (1) and to be heard by the \r\n\r\n\r\nCollector   in   terms   of   the   mandate   of   Section   5-A   (2).   In   support   of   his \r\n\r\n\r\nargument,  learned  counsel   relied   upon  the   judgments  in  Narayan   Govind \r\n\r\n\r\nGavate v. State of Maharashtra (1977) 1 SCC 133 and Esso Fabs Private \r\n\r\n\r\nLimited v. State of Haryana  (2009) 2 SCC 377. Another argument of the \r\n\r\n\r\nlearned   counsel   is   that   the   High   Court   misdirected   itself   in   summarily \r\n\r\n\r\ndismissing the writ petition ignoring the substantive plea of discrimination \r\n\r\n\r\nraised by the appellants. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13.     Shri   Dinesh   Dwivedi,   learned   senior   counsel   appearing   for   the \r\n\r\n\r\nrespondents urged that this Court should   not nullify the acquisition at the \r\n\r\n\r\ninstance of the appellants because the pleadings filed before the High Court \r\n\r\n\r\nwere not supported by proper affidavit. Shri Dwivedi argued that the High \r\n\r\n\r\nCourt   was   justified   in   non-suiting   the   appellants   because   they   did   not \r\n\r\n\r\nproduce   any   evidence   to   effectively   challenge   the   invoking   of   urgency \r\n\r\n\r\nprovision   contained   in   Section   17(1).   Learned   senior   counsel   emphasized \r\n\r\n\r\nthat the satisfaction envisaged in Section 17(1) is purely subjective and the \r\n\r\n\r\nCourt cannot review the decision taken by the State Government to invoke \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   urgency   clause.   He   submitted   that   planned   industrial   development   of \r\n\r\n\r\nDistrict   Gautam   Budh   Nagar   is   being   undertaken   in   consonance   with   the \r\n\r\n\r\npolicy decision taken by the State Government and the appellants cannot be \r\n\r\n\r\nheard to make a grievance against the acquisition of their land because they \r\n\r\n\r\nwill be duly compensated. In support of his argument, Shri Dwivedi relied \r\n\r\n\r\nupon the judgment of this Court in State of U.P. v. Pista Devi (1986) 4 SCC \r\n\r\n\r\n251 and Chameli Singh v. State of U.P. (1996) 2 SCC 549.  Learned senior \r\n\r\n\r\ncounsel further submitted that the appellants\' land cannot be released from \r\n\r\n\r\nacquisition   because   that   will   result   in   frustrating   the   objective   of   planned \r\n\r\n\r\nindustrial   development  of  the  district.   On the  issue of discrimination,  Shri \r\n\r\n\r\nDwivedi argued that even  if the land belonging to some persons has been \r\n\r\n\r\nillegally   left   out   from   acquisition,   the   appellants   are   not   entitled   to   a \r\n\r\n\r\ndirection that their land should also be released.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14.     The first issue which needs to be addressed is whether the High Court \r\n\r\n\r\nwas justified in non-suiting  the appellants on the ground that they had not \r\n\r\n\r\nraised a specific plea supported by a proper affidavit to question the decision \r\n\r\n\r\ntaken by the State Government to invoke Section 17(1) and 17(4) of the Act. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall also consider an ancillary issue   as to whether the appellants had \r\n\r\n\r\nsucceeded   in prima facie proving   that there was no justification to invoke \r\n\r\n\r\nthe urgency clause and to dispense with the inquiry envisaged under Section \r\n\r\n\r\n5-A.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15.           At   the   outset,   we   record   our   disapproval   of   the   casual   manner   in \r\n\r\n\r\nwhich the High Court disposed of the writ petition without even calling upon \r\n\r\n\r\nthe respondents to file counter affidavit and produce the relevant records. A \r\n\r\n\r\nreading of the averments contained in paragraphs 11 and 16 and grounds A \r\n\r\n\r\nand F of the writ petition, which have been extracted hereinabove   coupled \r\n\r\n\r\nwith the appellants\' assertion that the acquisition of their land was vitiated \r\n\r\n\r\ndue to discrimination inasmuch as  land belonging to influential persons had \r\n\r\n\r\nbeen left out from acquisition, but their land was acquired in total disregard \r\n\r\n\r\nof the policy of the State Government to leave out  land on which dwelling \r\n\r\n\r\nunits had already been constructed, show that they had succeeded in making \r\n\r\n\r\nout   a   strong   case   for   deeper   examination   of   the   issues   raised   in   the   writ \r\n\r\n\r\npetition     and   the  High   Court    committed   serious   error   by   summarily   non-\r\n\r\n\r\nsuiting them. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16.     The history of land acquisition legislations shows that in Eighteenth \r\n\r\n\r\nCentury, Bengal Regulation I of 1824, Act I of 1850, Act VI of 1857, Act \r\n\r\n\r\nXXII of 1863, Act X of 1870, Bombay Act No. XXVIII of 1839, Bombay \r\n\r\n\r\nAct No. XVII of 1850, Madras Act No. XX of 1852 and Madras Act No.1 of \r\n\r\n\r\n1854 were enacted to facilitate the acquisition of land and other immovable \r\n\r\n\r\nproperties for roads, canals, and other public purposes by paying the amount \r\n\r\n\r\nto be determined by the arbitrators.  In 1870, the Land Acquisition Act was \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenacted   to   provide   for   proper   valuation   of   the   acquired   land.     That   Act \r\n\r\n\r\nenvisaged that if the person having interest in   land is not agreeable to part \r\n\r\n\r\nwith possession by accepting the amount offered to him, then the Collector \r\n\r\n\r\nmay   make   a   reference   to   the   Civil   Court.   The   1870   Act   also   envisaged \r\n\r\n\r\nappointment   of   assessors   to   assist   the   Civil   Court.     If   the   Court   and   the \r\n\r\n\r\nassessor   did not  agree  on  the amount  then an  appeal  could be  filed  in  the \r\n\r\n\r\nHigh   Court.     This   mechanism   proved   ineffective   because   lot   of   time   was \r\n\r\n\r\nconsumed   in   litigation.     With   a   view   to   overcome   this   problem,   the \r\n\r\n\r\nlegislature   enacted   the   Act   on   the   line   of   the   English   Lands   Clauses \r\n\r\n\r\nConsolidation   Act,   1845.     However,   the   land   owners   or   persons   having \r\n\r\n\r\ninterest in land did not have any say in the acquisition process either under \r\n\r\n\r\npre-1984   legislations   or   the   1984   Act   (un-amended).   They   could   raise \r\n\r\n\r\nobjection   only   qua   the   amount   of   compensation   and   matters   connected \r\n\r\n\r\ntherewith.     The   absence   of   opportunity   to   raise   objection   against   the \r\n\r\n\r\nacquisition of land was resented by those who were deprived of their land. \r\n\r\n\r\nTo redress this grievance, Section 5A was inserted in the Act by amending \r\n\r\n\r\nAct No.38 of 1923.  The statement of Objects and Reasons contained in Bill \r\n\r\n\r\nNo.29 of 1923, which led to enactment of the amending Act read as under:\r\n\r\n\r\n                \"The   Land   Acquisition   Act   I   of   1894   does   not   provide \r\n\r\n                that   persons   having   an   interest   in   land   which   it   is \r\n\r\n                proposed to acquire, shall have the right of objecting to \r\n\r\n                such   acquisition;   nor   is   Government   bound   to   enquire \r\n\r\n                into   and   consider   any   objections   that   may   reach   them. \r\n\r\n                The   object   of   this   Bill   is   to   provide   that   a   Local \r\n\r\n                Government shall not declare, under Section 6 of the Act, \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            that any land is needed for a public purpose unless time \r\n\r\n            has   been   allowed   after   the   notification   under   Section   4 \r\n\r\n            for persons interested in the land to put in objections and \r\n\r\n            for   such   objections   to   be   considered   by   the   Local \r\n\r\n            Government.\"   \r\n\r\n\r\n17.             The   Act,   which   was   enacted   more   than   116   years   ago   for \r\n\r\n\r\nfacilitating   the   acquisition   of   land   and   other   immovable   properties   for \r\n\r\n\r\nconstruction of roads, canals, railways etc., has been frequently used in \r\n\r\n\r\nthe   post   independence   era   for   different   public   purposes   like   laying   of \r\n\r\n\r\nroads,     construction   of   bridges,   dams   and   buildings   of   various   public \r\n\r\n\r\nestablishments/institutions,   planned   development   of   urban   areas, \r\n\r\n\r\nproviding   of   houses   to   different   sections   of   the   society   and   for \r\n\r\n\r\ndeveloping residential colonies/sectors.  However, in the recent years, the \r\n\r\n\r\ncountry has witnessed a new phenomena.  Large tracts of land have been \r\n\r\n\r\nacquired in   rural parts of the country in the name of development and \r\n\r\n\r\ntransferred   to   private   entrepreneurs,   who   have   utilized   the   same   for \r\n\r\n\r\nconstruction   of   multi-storied   complexes,   commercial   centers   and   for \r\n\r\n\r\nsetting up industrial units.   Similarly, large scale acquisitions have been \r\n\r\n\r\nmade on behalf of the companies by invoking the provisions contained in \r\n\r\n\r\nPart VII of the Act. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18.       The resultant effect of these acquisitions is that the land owners, \r\n\r\n\r\nwho  were doing  agricultural   operations  and  other  ancillary   activities   in \r\n\r\n\r\nrural   areas,   have   been   deprived   of   the   only   source   of   their   livelihood. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMajority of them do not have any idea about their constitutional and legal \r\n\r\n\r\nrights,   which   can   be   enforced   by   availing   the   constitutional   remedies \r\n\r\n\r\nunder   Articles   32   and   226   of   the   Constitution.     They   reconcile   with \r\n\r\n\r\ndeprivation of land by accepting the amount of compensation offered by \r\n\r\n\r\nthe   Government   and   by   thinking   that   it   is   their   fate   and   destiny \r\n\r\n\r\ndetermined   by   God.     Even   those   who   get   semblance   of   education   are \r\n\r\n\r\nneither   conversant   with   the   functioning   of  the  State   apparatus   nor   they \r\n\r\n\r\ncan access the records prepared by the concerned authorities as a prelude \r\n\r\n\r\nto the acquisition of   land by invoking Section 4 with or without the aid \r\n\r\n\r\nof   Section   17(1)   and/or   17(4).       Therefore,   while   examining   the   land \r\n\r\n\r\nowner\'s   challenge   to   the   acquisition   of   land   in   a   petition   filed   under \r\n\r\n\r\nArticle   226   of   the   Constitution,     the   High   Court   should   not   adopt   a \r\n\r\n\r\npedantic approach, as has been done in the present case, and decide the \r\n\r\n\r\nmatter  keeping  in  view the  constitutional   goals  of  social  and  economic \r\n\r\n\r\njustice and the fact that even though the right to property is no longer a \r\n\r\n\r\nfundamental right, the same continues to be an important constitutional \r\n\r\n\r\nright   and   in   terms   of   Article   300-A,   no   person   can   be   deprived   of   his \r\n\r\n\r\nproperty   except   by   authority   of   law.     In   cases   where   the   acquisition   is \r\n\r\n\r\nmade   by   invoking   Section   4   read   with   Section   17(1)   and/or   17(4),   the \r\n\r\n\r\nHigh Court should insist upon filing of reply affidavit by the respondents \r\n\r\n\r\nand production of the relevant records and carefully scrutinize the same \r\n\r\n\r\nbefore   pronouncing   upon   legality   of   the   impugned   notification/action \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause a negative result without examining the relevant records to find \r\n\r\n\r\nout whether the competent authority had formed a bona fide opinion on \r\n\r\n\r\nthe issue of invoking the urgency provision and excluding the application \r\n\r\n\r\nof Section 5-A is likely to make the land owner a landless poor and force \r\n\r\n\r\nhim to migrate to the nearby city only to live in a slum.  A departure from \r\n\r\n\r\nthis   rule   should   be   made   only   when   land   is   required   to   meet   really \r\n\r\n\r\nemergent   situations   like   those   enumerated   in   Section   17(2).     If   the \r\n\r\n\r\nacquisition   is   intended   to   benefit   private   person(s)   and   the   provisions \r\n\r\n\r\ncontained in Section 17(1) and/or 17(4) are invoked, then scrutiny of the \r\n\r\n\r\njustification   put forward  by  the  State  should  be  more  rigorous  in cases \r\n\r\n\r\ninvolving the challenge to the acquisition of land, the pleadings should be \r\n\r\n\r\nliberally   construed   and   relief   should   not   be   denied   to   the   petitioner   by \r\n\r\n\r\napplying the technical rules of procedure embodied in the Code of Civil \r\n\r\n\r\nProcedure and other procedural laws. In this context it will be profitable \r\n\r\n\r\nto   notice   the   observations   made   by   this   Court   in  Authorised   Officer, \r\n\r\n\r\nThanjavur   v.   S   Naganatha   Ayyar  (1979)   3   SCC   466,   which   are     as \r\n\r\n\r\nunder:\r\n\r\n\r\n            \"It is true that Judges are constitutional invigilators \r\n\r\n            and   statutory   interpreters;   but   they   are   also   responsive \r\n\r\n            and responsible to Part IV of the Constitution being one \r\n\r\n            of  the   trinity   of  the  nation\'s   appointed   instrumentalities \r\n\r\n            in   the   transformation   of   the   socio-economic   order.   The \r\n\r\n            judiciary, in its sphere, shares the revolutionary purpose \r\n\r\n            of   the   constitutional   order,   and   when   called   upon   to \r\n\r\n            decode   social   legislation   must   be   animated   by   a   goal-\r\n\r\n            oriented   approach.   This   is   part   of   the   dynamics   of \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                statutory   interpretation   in   the   developing   countries   so \r\n\r\n                that courts are not converted into rescue shelters for those \r\n\r\n                who  seek  to  defeat  agrarian  justice  by  cute  transactions \r\n\r\n                of   many   manifestations   now   so   familiar   in   the   country \r\n\r\n                and   illustrated   by   the   several   cases   under   appeal.   This \r\n\r\n                caveat has become necessary because the judiciary is not \r\n\r\n                a mere umpire, as some assume, but an activist catalyst in \r\n\r\n                the constitutional scheme.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19.     We may now advert to the ancillary question whether the High Court \r\n\r\n\r\nwas justified in non suiting the appellants on the ground that they failed to \r\n\r\n\r\ndischarge   the   primary   burden   of   proving   that   the   State   Government   had \r\n\r\n\r\ninvoked Section 17(1) and 17(4) without application of mind to the relevant \r\n\r\n\r\nconsiderations.   In this context, it is apposite to observe that while dealing \r\n\r\n\r\nwith challenge to the acquisition  of land belonging to those who suffer from \r\n\r\n\r\nhandicaps of poverty, illiteracy and ignorance and do not have the resources \r\n\r\n\r\nto access the material relied upon by the functionaries of the   State and its \r\n\r\n\r\nagencies for forming an opinion or recording a satisfaction that the urgency \r\n\r\n\r\nprovisions   contained   in   Section   17(1)   should   be   resorted   to   and/or   the \r\n\r\n\r\nenquiry   envisaged   under   Section   5A   should     be   dispensed   with,   the   High \r\n\r\n\r\nCourt   should   not   literally   apply   the   abstract   rules   of   burden   of   proof \r\n\r\n\r\nenshrined   in   the   Evidence   Act.     It   is   too   much   to   expect   from   the   rustic \r\n\r\n\r\nvillagers, who are not conversant with the intricacies of law and functioning \r\n\r\n\r\nof the judicial system in our country to first obtain relevant information and \r\n\r\n\r\nrecords   from   the   concerned   State   authorities   and   then   present   skillfully \r\n\r\n\r\ndrafted petition for enforcement of his legal and/or constitutional rights. The \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCourt should also bear in mind that the relevant records are always  in the \r\n\r\n\r\nexclusive   possession/domain   of   the   authorities   of   the   State   and/or   its \r\n\r\n\r\nagencies.     Therefore,   an   assertion   by   the   appellants   that   there   was   no \r\n\r\n\r\nurgency   in   the   acquisition   of   land;   that   the   concerned   authorities   did   not \r\n\r\n\r\napply  mind  to  the  relevant  factors  and  records  and  arbitrarily  invoked  the \r\n\r\n\r\nurgency   provisions   and   thereby   denied   him   the   minimum   opportunity   of \r\n\r\n\r\nhearing in terms of Section 5-A(1) and (2), should be treated as sufficient \r\n\r\n\r\nfor   calling   upon   the   respondents   to   file   their   response   and   produce   the \r\n\r\n\r\nrelevant records to justify the invoking of urgency provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n20.     In  Narayan   Govind   Gavate   v.   State   of   Maharashtra  (supra),   the \r\n\r\n\r\nthree-Judge Bench of this Court examined the correctness of the judgment \r\n\r\n\r\nof   the   Bombay   High   Court   whereby   the   acquisition   of   land   by   the   State \r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment by issuing notification under Section 4 read with Section 17(1) \r\n\r\n\r\nand 17(4) for development and utilisation as residential and industrial area \r\n\r\n\r\nwas  quashed.   The   High Court held  that  the  purpose  of  acquisition  was a \r\n\r\n\r\ngenuine public purpose but quashed the notifications by observing that the \r\n\r\n\r\nburden   of   proving   the   existence   of   circumstances   which   could   justify \r\n\r\n\r\ninvoking   of   urgency   clause   was   on   the   State,   which   it   had   failed   to \r\n\r\n\r\ndischarge. Some of the observations made by the High Court, which have \r\n\r\n\r\nbeen extracted in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the judgment of this Court, are \r\n\r\n\r\nreproduced below.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When the formation of an opinion or the satisfaction of \r\n\r\nan authority is subjective but is a condition precedent to \r\n\r\nthe exercise of a power, the challenge to the formation of \r\n\r\nsuch opinion or to such satisfaction is limited, in law, to \r\n\r\nthree   points   only.   It   can   be   challenged,   firstly,   on   the \r\n\r\nground   of   mala   fides;   secondly,   on   the   ground   that   the \r\n\r\nauthority which formed that opinion or which arrived at \r\n\r\nsuch satisfaction did not apply its mind to the material on \r\n\r\nwhich it formed the opinion or arrived at the satisfaction, \r\n\r\nand,   thirdly,   that   the   material   on   which   it   formed   its \r\n\r\nopinion   or   reached   the   satisfaction   was   so   insufficient \r\n\r\nthat no man  could reasonably  reach that conclusion.  So \r\n\r\nfar as the third point is concerned, no court of law can, as \r\n\r\nin an appeal, consider that, on the material placed before \r\n\r\nthe   authority,   the   authority   was   justified   in   reaching   its \r\n\r\nconclusion.   The   court   can   interfere   only   in   such   cases \r\n\r\nwhere there was no material at all or the material was so \r\n\r\ninsufficient   that   no   man   could   have   reasonably   reached \r\n\r\nthat conclusion. \r\n\r\nIn   the   case   before   us   the   petitioner   has   stated   in   the \r\n\r\npetition more than once that the urgency clause had been \r\n\r\napplied without any valid reason. The urgency clause in \r\n\r\nrespect of each of the said two notifications  concerning \r\n\r\nthe lands in Groups 1 and 2 is contained in the relative \r\n\r\nSection 4 notification itself. The public purpose stated in \r\n\r\nthe notification is `for development and utilization of the \r\n\r\nsaid lands as an industrial and residential area\'. To start \r\n\r\nwith, this statement itself is vague, in the sense that it is \r\n\r\nnot clear whether the development and utilization of the \r\n\r\nlands   referred   to   in   that   statement   was   confined   to   the \r\n\r\nlands mentioned in the schedule to the notification or it \r\n\r\napplied to a wider area of which such lands formed only \r\n\r\na   part.   So   far   as   the   affidavit   in   reply   is   concerned,   no \r\n\r\nfacts   whatever   are   stated.   The   affidavit   only   states   that \r\n\r\nthe   authority   i.e.   the   Commissioner   of   the   Bombay \r\n\r\nDivision   was   satisfied   that   the   possession   of   the   said \r\n\r\nlands  was  urgently   required   for the  purpose   of  carrying \r\n\r\nout   the   said   development.   Even   Mr   Setalvad   conceded \r\n\r\nthat the affidavit does not contain a statement of facts on \r\n\r\nwhich the authority was satisfied or on which it formed \r\n\r\nits   opinion.  It   is,   therefore,   quite   clear   that   the \r\n\r\nrespondents  have failed  to bring on record any material \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                whatever   on   which   the   respondents   formed   the   opinion \r\n\r\n                mentioned   in   the   two   notifications.  The   notifications \r\n\r\n                themselves show that they concern many lands other than \r\n\r\n                those   falling   in   the   said   first   and   third   groups.   It   is   not \r\n\r\n                possible   to   know   what   was   the   development   for   which \r\n\r\n                the lands were being acquired, much less is it possible to \r\n\r\n                know   what   were   the   circumstances   which   caused \r\n\r\n                urgency   in   the   taking   of   possession   of   such   lands.  We \r\n\r\n                have held that the burden of proving such circumstances, \r\n\r\n                at   least   prima   facie   is   on   the   respondents.   As   the \r\n\r\n                respondents   have   brought   no   relevant   material   on   the \r\n\r\n                record,   the   respondents   have   failed   to   discharge   that \r\n\r\n                burden.  We   must,   in   conclusion,   hold   that   the   urgency \r\n\r\n                provision   under   Section   17(4)   was   not   validly   resorted \r\n\r\n                to.\"\r\n\r\n                                                                     (emphasis supplied)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        While   dealing   with   the   argument   of   the   State   that   it   was   for   the \r\n\r\n\r\npetitioner   to   prove   that   there   was   no   material   to   justify   invoking   of   the \r\n\r\n\r\nurgency clause, this Court observed:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"We do not think that a question relating to burden of proof is \r\n\r\n        always free from difficulty or is quite so simple as it is sought \r\n\r\n        to   be   made   out   here.   Indeed,   the   apparent   simplicity   of   a \r\n\r\n        question relating to presumptions and burdens of proof, which \r\n\r\n        have   to   be   always   viewed   together   is   often   deceptive.   Over \r\n\r\n        simplification  of  such  questions  leads  to  erroneous  statements \r\n\r\n        and misapplications of the law.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        The Court then referred to the judgment in Woolmington v. Director \r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Prosecutions,  1935 AC 462, extensively quoted from     Phipson on \r\n\r\n\r\nEvidence (11th Edn),  noticed Sections 101 to 106 of the Evidence Act and \r\n\r\n\r\nobserved:\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Coming   back   to   the   cases   before   us,   we   find   that   the \r\n\r\nHigh   Court   had   correctly   stated   the   grounds   on   which \r\n\r\neven a subjective opinion as to the existence of the need \r\n\r\nto   take   action   under   Section   17(4)   of   the   Act   can   be \r\n\r\nchallenged on certain limited grounds. But, as soon as we \r\n\r\nspeak of a challenge we have to bear in mind the general \r\n\r\nburdens   laid   down   by   Sections   101   and   102   of   the \r\n\r\nEvidence  Act.  It   is  for  the   petitioner  to  substantiate  the \r\n\r\ngrounds of his challenge. This means  that the petitioner \r\n\r\nhas  to either  lead evidence or show  that some  evidence \r\n\r\nhas come from the side of the respondents to indicate that \r\n\r\nhis challenge to a notification or order is made good. If \r\n\r\nhe does not succeed in discharging that duty his petition \r\n\r\nwill fail. But, is that the position in the cases before us? \r\n\r\nWe   find   that,   although   the   High   Court   had   stated   the \r\n\r\nquestion before it to be one which \"narrows down to the \r\n\r\npoint as to the burden of proof\" yet, it had analysed the \r\n\r\nevidence   sufficiently   before   it   to   reach   the   conclusion \r\n\r\nthat   the   urgency   provision   under   Section   17(4)   had   not \r\n\r\nbeen validly resorted to.\r\n\r\n                                              \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n We think that the original or stable onus laid down by \r\n\r\nSection 101 and Section 102 of the Evidence Act cannot \r\n\r\nbe shifted by the use of Section 106 of the Evidence Act, \r\n\r\nalthough   the   particular   onus   of   providing   facts   and \r\n\r\ncircumstances   lying   especially   within   the   knowledge   of \r\n\r\nthe official who formed the opinion which resulted in the \r\n\r\nnotification   under   Section   17   (4)   of   the   Act   rests   upon \r\n\r\nthat   official.   The   recital,   if   it   is   not   defective,   may \r\n\r\nobviate   the   need   to   look   further.   But,   there   may   be \r\n\r\ncircumstances in the case which impel the court to look \r\n\r\nbeyond it. And, at that stage, Section 106 Evidence Act \r\n\r\ncan   be   invoked   by   the   party   assailing   an   order   or \r\n\r\nnotification.   It   is   most   unsafe   in   such   cases   for   the \r\n\r\nofficial or authority concerned to rest content which non-\r\n\r\ndisclosure of facts especially within his or its knowledge \r\n\r\nby relying on the sufficiency of a recital. Such an attitude \r\n\r\nmay itself justify further judicial scrutiny.\r\n\r\n                                              \r\n\r\nIn   the   cases   before   us,   if   the   total   evidence   from \r\n\r\nwhichever side any of it may have come, was insufficient \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            to   enable   the   petitioners   to   discharge   their   general   or \r\n\r\n            stable   onus,   their   petitions   could   not   succeed.   On   the \r\n\r\n            other hand, if, in addition to the bare assertions made by \r\n\r\n            the petitioners, that the urgency contemplated by Section \r\n\r\n            17(4)   did   not   exist,   there   were   other   facts   and \r\n\r\n            circumstances,   including   the   failure   of   the   State   to \r\n\r\n            indicate   facts   and   circumstances   which   it   could   have \r\n\r\n            easily  disclosed  if  they  existed, the petitioners  could be \r\n\r\n            held to have discharged their general onus.\r\n\r\n                                                            \r\n\r\n            It is also clear that, even a technically correct recital in an \r\n\r\n            order or notification stating that the conditions precedent \r\n\r\n            to   the   exercise   of   a   power   have   been   fulfilled   may   not \r\n\r\n            debar   the   court   in   a   given   case   from   considering   the \r\n\r\n            question   whether,   in   fact,   those   conditions   have   been \r\n\r\n            fulfilled.     And,   a   fortiori,   the   court   may   consider   and \r\n\r\n            decide   whether   the   authority   concerned   has   applied   its \r\n\r\n            mind   to   really   relevant   facts   of   a   case   with   a   view   to \r\n\r\n            determining that a condition precedent to the exercise of \r\n\r\n            a   power   has   been   fulfilled.     If   it   appears,   upon   an \r\n\r\n            examination  of  the  totality   of facts   in  the  case,   that  the \r\n\r\n            power conferred has been exercised for an extraneous or \r\n\r\n            irrelevant purpose or that the mind has not been applied \r\n\r\n            at all to the real object or purpose of a power, so that the \r\n\r\n            result is that the exercise of power could only serve some \r\n\r\n            other or collateral object, the court will interfere.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court finally held as under:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            \"There is no indication whatsoever in the \r\n\r\n            affidavit   filed   on   behalf   of   the   State   the   mind   of   the \r\n\r\n            Commissioner was applied at all to the question whether \r\n\r\n            it was a case necessitating the elimination of the enquiry \r\n\r\n            under   Section5A   of   the   Act.   The   recitals   in   the \r\n\r\n            notifications, on the other hand, indicate that elimination \r\n\r\n            of the enquiry under Section 5A of the Act was treated as \r\n\r\n            an automatic consequence of the opinion formed on other \r\n\r\n            matters.  The  recital does not say  at all that any opinion \r\n\r\n            was   formed   on   the   need   to   dispense   with   the   enquiry \r\n\r\n            under   Section   5A   of   the   Act.   It   is   certainly   a   case   in \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               which   the   recital   was   at   least   defective.   The   burden, \r\n\r\n               therefore, rested upon the State to remove the defect, if \r\n\r\n               possible,   by   evidence   to   show   that   some   exceptional \r\n\r\n               circumstances   which   necessitated   the   elimination   of   an \r\n\r\n               enquiry under Section 5A of the Act and that the mind of \r\n\r\n               the Commissioner was applied to this essential question. \r\n\r\n               It seems to us that the High Court correctly   applied the \r\n\r\n               provisions   of  Section   106  of  the   Evidence   Act   to  place \r\n\r\n               the   burden   upon   the   State     to   prove   those   special \r\n\r\n               circumstances,   although   it   also   appears   to   us   that   the \r\n\r\n               High Court was quite correct in stating its view in such a \r\n\r\n               manner as to make it appear that some part of the initial \r\n\r\n               burden of the petitioners  under Sections 101 and 102 of \r\n\r\n               the Evidence Act had been displaced by the failure of the \r\n\r\n               State to discharge  its duty under Section 106 of the Act. \r\n\r\n               The correct way of putting it would have been to say that \r\n\r\n               the failure of the State  to produce the evidence of facts \r\n\r\n               especially   within   the   knowledge   of   its   officials,   which \r\n\r\n               rested   upon   it   under   Section   106   of   the   Evidence   Act, \r\n\r\n               taken together with the attendant facts and circumstances \r\n\r\n               including   the   contents   of   recitals,   had   enabled   the \r\n\r\n               petitioners to discharge  their burden under Sections 101 \r\n\r\n               and 102 of the Evidence Act.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                              (emphasis supplied)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21.     The ratio of the aforesaid judgment was recently followed by the two-\r\n\r\n\r\nJudge  Bench   in  Anand  Singh  v.

However,  the   only   amendment   which   is  relevant   for   deciding \r\n\r\n\r\nthis case is the insertion of proviso to Section 17(4) vide Uttar Pradesh Act \r\n\r\n\r\nNo.8 of 1974.  That proviso reads as under:\r\n\r\n\r\n                \"Provided that where in the case of any land, notification \r\n\r\n                under section 4, sub-section (1) has been published in the \r\n\r\n                Official   Gazette   on   or   after   September   24,   1984   but \r\n\r\n                before   January   11,   1989,   and   the   appropriate \r\n\r\n                Government has under this sub-section directed that the \r\n\r\n                provisions   of   section   5A   shall   not   apply,   a   declaration \r\n\r\n                under section 6 in respect of the land may be made either \r\n\r\n                simultaneously with, or at any time after, the publication \r\n\r\n                in the Official Gazette of the notification under section 4, \r\n\r\n                sub-section (1).\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23.     ANALYSIS OF THE PROVISIONS:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Section   4(1)   lays   down   that   whenever   it   appears   to   the   appropriate \r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment that land in any locality is needed or is likely to be needed for \r\n\r\n\r\nany   public   purpose   or   for   a   company,   then   a   notification   to   that   effect   is \r\n\r\n\r\nrequired to be published in the Official Gazette and two daily newspapers \r\n\r\n\r\nhaving   circulation   in   the   locality.     Of   these,   one   paper   has   to   be   in   the \r\n\r\n\r\nregional language.  A duty is also cast on the Collector, as defined in Section \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3(c), to cause public notice of the substance of such notification to be given \r\n\r\n\r\nat convenient places in the locality.  The last date of publication and giving \r\n\r\n\r\nof   public   notice   is   treated   as   the   date   of   publication   of   the   notification. \r\n\r\n\r\nSection   4(2)   lays   down   that   after   publication   of   the   notification   under \r\n\r\n\r\nSection   4(1),   any   officer   authorised   by   the  Government  in  this   behalf,   his \r\n\r\n\r\nservants or workmen can enter upon and survey and take levels of any land \r\n\r\n\r\nin   the   locality   or to   dig   or   bore   into   the   sub-soil   and   to   do   all   other   acts \r\n\r\n\r\nnecessary for ascertaining that land is suitable for the purpose of acquisition. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe   concerned  officer,  his   servants  or  workmen   can  fix   the  boundaries  of \r\n\r\n\r\nland   proposed   to   be   acquired   and   the   intended   line   of   the   work,   if   any, \r\n\r\n\r\nproposed to be made on it.  They can also mark such levels and boundaries \r\n\r\n\r\nby   marks   and   cutting   trenches   and   cut   down   and   clear   any   part   of   any \r\n\r\n\r\nstanding crops, fence or jungle for the purpose of completing the survey and \r\n\r\n\r\ntaking level, marking of boundaries and line.   However, neither the officer \r\n\r\n\r\nnor his servants or workmen can, without the consent of the occupier, enter \r\n\r\n\r\ninto   any   building   or   upon   any   enclosed   court   or   garden   attached   to   a \r\n\r\n\r\ndwelling house without giving seven days\' notice to the occupier.     Section \r\n\r\n\r\n5A,  which   embodies  the  most   important  dimension  of  the  rules  of  natural \r\n\r\n\r\njustice,   lays   down   that   any   person   interested   in   any   land   notified   under \r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4(1) may, within 30 days of publication of the notification, submit \r\n\r\n\r\nobjection in writing against the proposed acquisition of land or of any land \r\n\r\n\r\nin the locality to the Collector.  The Collector is required to give the objector \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan opportunity of being heard either in person or by any person authorized \r\n\r\n\r\nby him or by pleader.  After hearing the objector (s) and making such further \r\n\r\n\r\ninquiry,   as   he   may   think   necessary,   the   Collector   has   to   make   a   report   in \r\n\r\n\r\nrespect of land notified under Section 4(1) with his recommendations on the \r\n\r\n\r\nobjections and forward the same to the Government along with the record of \r\n\r\n\r\nthe proceedings held by him.   The Collector can make  different reports in \r\n\r\n\r\nrespect of different parcels of land proposed to be acquired.  Upon receipt of \r\n\r\n\r\nthe Collector\'s report, the appropriate Government is required to take action \r\n\r\n\r\nunder Section 6(1) which lays down that after considering the report, if any, \r\n\r\n\r\nmade   under   Section   5-A   (2),   the   appropriate   Government   is   satisfied   that \r\n\r\n\r\nany particular land is needed for a public purpose, then a declaration to that \r\n\r\n\r\neffect   is   required   to   be   made   under   the   signatures   of   a   Secretary   to   the \r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment   or   of   some   officer   duly   authorised   to   certify   its   orders.   This \r\n\r\n\r\nsection also envisages making of different declarations from time to time in \r\n\r\n\r\nrespect of different parcels of land covered by the same notification issued \r\n\r\n\r\nunder   Section   5(1).     In   terms   of  clause   (ii)   of   proviso   to   Section   6(1),   no \r\n\r\n\r\ndeclaration in respect of any particular land covered by a notification issued \r\n\r\n\r\nunder   Section   4(1),   which   is   published   after   24.9.1989   can   be   made   after \r\n\r\n\r\nexpiry of one year from the date of publication of the notification.  To put it \r\n\r\n\r\ndifferently,  a declaration  is required  to be made  under Section  6(1) within \r\n\r\n\r\none year from the date of publication of the notification under Section 4(1). \r\n\r\n\r\nIn   terms   of   Section   6(2),   every   declaration   made   under   Section   6(1)   is \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrequired to be published in the official gazette and in two daily newspapers \r\n\r\n\r\nhaving circulation in the locality in which land proposed to be acquired is \r\n\r\n\r\nsituated.     Of   these,   at   least   one   must   be   in   the   regional   language.     The \r\n\r\n\r\nCollector   is   also   required   to   cause   public   notice   of   the   substance   of   such \r\n\r\n\r\ndeclaration to be given at convenient places in the locality.  The declaration \r\n\r\n\r\nto   be   published   under   Section   6(2)   must   contain   the   district   or   other \r\n\r\n\r\nterritorial   division   in   which   land   is   situate,   the   purpose   for   which   it   is \r\n\r\n\r\nneeded,   its   approximate   area   or  a   plan  is   made   in  respect   of   land  and   the \r\n\r\n\r\nplace where such plan can be inspected.   Section 6 (3) lays down that the \r\n\r\n\r\ndeclaration made under Section 6(1) shall be conclusive evidence of the fact \r\n\r\n\r\nthat land is needed for a public purpose. After publication of the declaration \r\n\r\n\r\nunder   Section   6,   the   Collector   is   required   to   take   order   from   the   State \r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment for the acquisition of land to be carved out and measured and \r\n\r\n\r\nplanned (Sections 7 and 8). The next stage as envisaged is issue of public \r\n\r\n\r\nnotice   and   individual   notice   to   the   persons   interested   in   land   to   file   their \r\n\r\n\r\nclaim for compensation. Section 11 envisages holding of an enquiry into the \r\n\r\n\r\nclaim and passing of an award by the Collector who is required to take into \r\n\r\n\r\nconsideration the provisions contained in Section 23. Section 16 lays down \r\n\r\n\r\nthat after making an award the Collector can take possession of land which \r\n\r\n\r\nshall thereafter  vest in the Government. Section  17(1) postulates taking of \r\n\r\n\r\npossession of land without making an award.  If the appropriate Government \r\n\r\n\r\ndecides   that   land   proposed   to   be   acquired   is   urgently   needed   for   a   public \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npurpose   then   it   can   authorise   the   competent   authority   to   take   possession. \r\n\r\n\r\nSection 17(2) contemplates a different type of urgency in which, the State \r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment   can   authorise   taking   of   possession   even   before   expiry   of   15 \r\n\r\n\r\ndays period specified in Section 9 (1).  Section 17(4) lays down that in cases \r\n\r\n\r\nwhere   appropriate   Government   comes   to   the   conclusion   that   there   is \r\n\r\n\r\nexistence   of   an   urgency   or   unforeseen   emergency,   it   can   direct   that \r\n\r\n\r\nprovisions of Section 5-A shall not apply.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n24.      Before   adverting   to   the   precedents   in   which   Section   5A   has   been \r\n\r\n\r\ninterpreted by this Court, it will be useful to notice development of the law \r\n\r\n\r\nrelating   to   the   rule   of   hearing.   In   the   celebrated   case   of  Cooper   v. \r\n\r\n\r\nWandsworth Board of Works (1863) 143 ER 414, the principle was stated \r\n\r\n\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n\r\n         \"Even God did not pass a sentence upon Adam, before he was \r\n\r\n         called upon to make his defence.  \"Adam\" says God, \"where art \r\n\r\n         thou?     hast   thou   not   eaten   of   the   tree   whereof   I   commanded \r\n\r\n         thee that thou shouldest not eat\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTherein   the   District   Board   had   brought   down   the   house   of   the   plaintiff\'s \r\n\r\n\r\n(Cooper),   because   he   had   failed   to   comply   with   The   Metropolis   Local \r\n\r\n\r\nManagement Act.   The Act required the plaintiff to notify the board seven \r\n\r\n\r\ndays before starting to build the house.  Cooper argued that even though the \r\n\r\n\r\nboard had the legal authority to tear his house down, no person should be \r\n\r\n\r\ndeprived of their property without notice.  In spite of no express words in the \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstatute the court recognized the right of hearing before the plaintiff\'s house \r\n\r\n\r\nbuilt without permission was demolished in the exercise of statutory powers. \r\n\r\n\r\nByles J stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               `Although there are not positive words in a statute \r\n\r\n               requiring   that   the   party   shall   be   heard,   yet   the \r\n\r\n               justice   of   the   common   law   shall   supply   the \r\n\r\n               omission of the legislature\'.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n25.    Perhaps the best known statement on the right to be heard has come \r\n\r\n\r\nfrom Lord Loreburn, L.C. in Board of Education v. Rice (1911 AC 179 at \r\n\r\n\r\n182), where he observed: \r\n\r\n\r\n       \"Comparatively   recent   statutes   have   extended,   if   they   have \r\n\r\n       originated, the practice of imposing upon departments or offices \r\n\r\n       of   State   the   duty   of   deciding   or   determining   questions   of \r\n\r\n       various kindsIn such cases they must act in good faith and \r\n\r\n       fairly listen to both sides, for that is a duty lying upon everyone \r\n\r\n       who   decides   anything.     But   I   do   not   think   they   are   bound   to \r\n\r\n       treat such questions as though it were a trial they can obtain \r\n\r\n       information   in   any   way   they   think   best,   always   giving   a   fair \r\n\r\n       opportunity   to   those   who   are   parties   in   the   controversy   for \r\n\r\n       correcting or contradicting any relevant statement prejudicial in \r\n\r\n       their view.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n26.    In  Ridge   v.   Baldwin  1964   AC   40   Lord   Reid   emphasized   on   the \r\n\r\n\r\nuniversality of the right to a fair hearing whether it concerns the property or \r\n\r\n\r\ntenure   of   an   office   or   membership   of   an   institution.     In  O\'Reilly   v. \r\n\r\n\r\nMackman 1983 2 AC 237, Lord Diplock said that the right of a man to be \r\n\r\n\r\ngiven   a   fair   opportunity   of   hearing,   what   is   alleged   against   him   and   of \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npresenting his own case is so fundamental to any civilized legal system that \r\n\r\n\r\nit is to be presumed that Parliament intended that failure to observe the same \r\n\r\n\r\nshould   render   null   and   void   any   decision   reached   in   breach   of   this \r\n\r\n\r\nrequirement.  In Lloyd v. Mcmahon 1987 AC 625 Lord Bridge said:\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"My   Lords,   the   so-called   rules   of   natural   justice   are   not \r\n\r\n        engraved  on tablets  of  stone.   To  use  the  phrase   which better \r\n\r\n        expresses   the   underlying   concept,   what   the   requirements   of \r\n\r\n        fairness   demand   when   any   body,   domestic,   administrative   or \r\n\r\n        judicial, has to make a decision which will affect the rights of \r\n\r\n        individuals   depends   on   the   character   of   the   decision-making \r\n\r\n        body, the kind of decision it has to make and the statutory or \r\n\r\n        other framework in which it operates. In particular, it is well-\r\n\r\n        established  that when a statute has conferred on any body the \r\n\r\n        power  to make   decisions  affecting  individuals,  the  courts  will \r\n\r\n        not  only  require   the   procedure  prescribed  by  the  statute  to  be \r\n\r\n        followed,   but   will   readily   imply   so   much   and   no   more   to   be \r\n\r\n        introduced  by way of additional procedural  safeguards  as will \r\n\r\n        ensure the attainment of fairness.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n27.     In the United States, principles of natural justice usually find support \r\n\r\n\r\nfrom the Due Process clause of the Constitution.  The extent of due process \r\n\r\n\r\nprotection   required   is   determined   by   a   number   of   factors;   first   the   private \r\n\r\n\r\ninterest   that   will   be   affected   by   the   official   action;   second,   the   risk   of   an \r\n\r\n\r\nerroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the \r\n\r\n\r\nprobable   value,   if   any,   of   additional   or   substitute   procedural   requirement \r\n\r\n\r\nwould entail.  \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n28.    The   amplitude,   ambit   and   width  of   the   rule   of  audi  alteram   partem \r\n\r\n\r\nwas lucidly stated by the three-Judge bench in  Sayeedur Rehman v. State \r\n\r\n\r\nof Bihar (1973) 3 SCC 333 in the following words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               \"11This   unwritten   right   of   hearing   is \r\n\r\n               fundamental   to   a   just   decision   by   any   authority   which \r\n\r\n               decides   a   controversial   issue   affecting   the   rights   of   the \r\n\r\n               rival contestants. This right has its roots in the notion of \r\n\r\n               fair   procedure.   It   draws   the   attention   of   the   party \r\n\r\n               concerned to the imperative necessity of not overlooking \r\n\r\n               the other side of the case before coming to its decision, \r\n\r\n               for   nothing   is   more   likely   to   conduce   to   just   and   right \r\n\r\n               decision   than   the   practice   of   giving   hearing   to   the \r\n\r\n               affected parties.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n29.    In  Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner  (1978) 1 \r\n\r\n\r\nSCC   405,   Krishna   Iyer   J.   speaking   for   himself,   Beg   CJ   and   Bhagwati   J. \r\n\r\n\r\nhighlighted the importance of rule of hearing in the following words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               \"43. Indeed, natural justice is a pervasive facet of secular \r\n\r\n               law   where   a   spiritual   touch   enlivens   legislation, \r\n\r\n               administration and adjudication, to make fairness a creed \r\n\r\n               of life. It has, many colours and shades, many forms and \r\n\r\n               shapes   and,   save   where   valid   law   excludes   it,   applies \r\n\r\n               when   people   are   affected   by   acts   of   authority.   It   is   the \r\n\r\n               hone   of   healthy   government,   recognised   from   earliest \r\n\r\n               times   and   not   a   mystic   testament   of   Judge-made   law. \r\n\r\n               Indeed,   from   the   legendary   days   of   Adam   --   and   of \r\n\r\n               Kautilya\'s  Arthasastra  --   the   rule   of   law   has   had   this \r\n\r\n               stamp of natural justice which makes it social justice. We \r\n\r\n               need   not   go   into   these   deeps   for   the   present   except   to \r\n\r\n               indicate that the roots of natural justice and its foliage are \r\n\r\n               noble and not new-fangled. Today its application must be \r\n\r\n               sustained by current legislation, case-law or other extant \r\n\r\n               principle, not the hoary chords of legend and history. Our \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               jurisprudence has sanctioned its prevalence even like the \r\n\r\n               Anglo-American system.\r\n\r\n                                                                  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n               48.  Once we understand the soul of the rule as fair play \r\n\r\n               in action -- and it is so -- we must hold that it extends to \r\n\r\n               both   the   fields.   After   all,   administrative   power   in   a \r\n\r\n               democratic set-up is not allergic to fairness in action and \r\n\r\n               discretionary   executive   justice   cannot   degenerate   into \r\n\r\n          The High Court was justified in non-suiting the appellants on the ground that they had not raised a specific plea supported by a proper affidavit to question the decision taken by the State Government to invoke Section 17(1) and 17(4) of the Act. There was not any valid ground or justification for invoking the urgency provision contained in Section 17(1) and to exclude the application of Section 5A for the acquisition of land for planned industrial development of the district. The acquisition is primarily meant to cater private interest in the name of industrial development of the district. No evidence has been produced before the Court to show that the State Government and/or agencies/instrumentalities of the State are intending to establish industrial units on the acquired land either by itself or through its agencies/instrumentalities. The Supreme Court observed that even if planned industrial development of the district is treated as public purpose within the meaning of Section 4, there was no urgency which could justify the exercise of power by the State Government under Section 17(1) and 17(4). The private entrepreneurs, who are desirous of making investment in the State, take their own time in setting up the industrial units. Therefore, time required for ensuring compliance of the provisions contained in Section 5-A cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be portrayed as delay which will frustrate the purpose of acquisition and it was held that there was no real and substantive urgency to justify invoking of the urgency provision under Section 17(1) and to exclude the application of Section 5-A. The order of the High Court set aside. The respondents are directed to proceed from the stage of Section 4 notification and take appropriate action after complying with Section 5-A(1) and (2) of the Act. The appeal was allowed. Appeals Allowed','Daya Shankar Vs State Of M.P Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.\n\n\n\n1.    Leave granted.\n\n\n\n2.    Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a Division Bench of the\n\nMadhya Pradesh High Court upholding the conviction of the appellant for\n\noffence punishable under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the Indian\n\nPenal Code, 1860 (in short the `IPC&apos;) as was awarded by learned Additional\n\nSessions Judge, Panna, in Sessions Trial No.15/1992.\n3.    Prosecution version as unfolded during trial is as follows:\n\n\n\n      On 30th November, 1991 at about 5.00 p.m. Ram Kishore (hereinafter\n\nreferred to as the `deceased&apos;) was murdered in an agricultural field. First\n\nInformation Report was lodged by Manik Lal at Police Station, Pawal in the\n\nevening at about 7.00 p.m. Offence was registered as Crime No.124/91\n\nunder Section 302/34 IPC. Deceased had eloped with Lalli, sister of\n\nRamcharan (A-2) and both of them had performed court marriage. The court\n\nmarriage was registered and Lalli was living with Ramkishore. The\n\nappellant was having enmity with deceased on account of aforesaid\n\nincident. Deceased after eloping with Lalli was living in some other village\n\nand returned to his village a month before the incident. Ramkishore had\n\ngone to answer the call of nature in the evening on 30.11.1991 at about 4.30\n\np.m. towards the agricultural field of Gadka. Around 5 p.m. Phulla (A-3)\n\narmed with axe, Ramcharan (A-2) armed with sword alongwith\n\nDayashankar (A-1) and Munni Lal (A-4) went to the field of Gadaka. Munni\n\nLal and Dayashankar were barehanded. Phulla gave axe blow on the head of\n\ndeceased. Thereafter, Dayashankar and Munnilal, the co-accused pulled the\n\nlegs of deceased and threw him on the ground. Ram Kishore fell on the\n\n\n\n \ncrops in the field. Ramcharan assaulted the deceased by sword on the chest.\n\nThen he placed his sword on the chest of the deceased. On account of\n\nbeating he died. Police after receiving information of the commission of\n\ncrime carried out the investigation, arrested the accused persons and filed\n\nthe challan on 3.1.1992 before the Court of Judicial Magistrate. Case was\n\ncommitted to the Court of Sessions Judge. Trial Court framed charges under\n\nSection 302/34 IPC against the accused persons. After recording the\n\nevidence the trial Court convicted the accused persons for offence under\n\nSections 302 read with Section 34 IPC and sentenced them as afore-noted.\n\n\n\n      Before the High Court the basic stand was that the prosecution failed\n\nto prove common intention on the part of the appellants and, therefore,\n\nSection 34 had no application. The individual act of the appellant should\n\nhave been considered. Merely because the appellant had accompanied other\n\naccused persons, that cannot be sufficient to warrant presumption of\n\ncommon intention.\n\n\n\n4.    Learned counsel for the State submitted that the eye witnesses PWs 2\n\nand 3 had described the act of each of the appellants and the role ascribed to\n\nthe appellant was that he pulled the leg of the deceased as a result of which\n\n\n\n \ndeceased fell in the field of Masur crop and thereafter he was assaulted by\n\nother accused persons. The appeal was dismissed accepting the stand of the\n\nState.\n\n\n\n5.       Learned counsel for the appellant re-iterated the stand taken before\n\nthe High Court and submitted that Section 34 IPC has no application.\n\n\n\n6.       Learned counsel for the State on the other hand supported the\n\njudgment.\n\n\n\n7.       Section 34 has been enacted on the principle of joint liability in the\n\ndoing of a criminal act. The Section is only a rule of evidence and does not\n\ncreate a substantive offence. The distinctive feature of the Section is the\n\neleme Indian Penal Code, 1860 - Section 302/34 - Murder- - Conviction and sentence- - Whether calls for obstruction?- - Held, \"yes\"- - Evidence of observers did not credit any clear demonstration to litigant - Mere truth that he was in organization of blamed who were equipped - Not adequate to draw in Section 34- - Appellant not outfitted - He had no ill will with expired - Stand that he pulled leg of perished - Not built up - Not suitable to hold appealing party blameworthy by utilization of Section 34- - His conviction put aside.

The Board of Trustees of the Port of Bombay is the appellant\n\nbefore us.\n\n2.

After some arguments were advanced by\n\nthe learned counsel for the parties, our attention was drawn to an order of\n\nthis Court dated 3rd of August, 2001 from which it appears that the\n\nappellant had invoked the bank guarantee on 29th of March, 1988.\n\nHowever, the bank chose not to make the payment and in fact on 28th of\n\nApril, 1988, the High Court granted stay of encashment of the bank\nguarantee. This Court in that order also noted that the bank guarantee in\n\nquestion had expired on 24th of February, 1989. This Court while passing\n\nthe aforesaid order made the following direction :\n\n            \"pending hearing of the appeal, it shall pay to\n      the appellant the amount of the bank guarantee which was\n      invoked on 29th of March, 1988 along with interest at the rate\n      of 18% with quarterly rests with effect from the date of the\n      invocati Civil  Injunction - Suit petitioned for order controlling the appealing party from encashing a bank ensure issued by the bank at the case of the respondent No. 1 - Appellant had conjured the bank ensure yet the bank picked not to make the installment - High Court conceded remain of encashment of the bank ensure - Appellant has as of now been paid by the bank - Held, litigant was qualified for get the central aggregate together with enthusiasm at the rate of 8% - Appeal discarded. [para 3] ','G. Narayana Raju Vs G. Chamaraju &amp; Others CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 613 of 1965.\nAppeal from the judgment and decree dated March 25, 1960  of\nthe Mysore High Court in Regular Appeal No. 155 of 1953.\nV. Krishnamurthy and R. Gopdlakrishnan, for the appellant.\nH.   R.	 Gokhale,  B.  Subbiah	and  R.	 Thiagaraian,	for,\nrespondents Nos. 2 and 4.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRamaswami,  J. The plaintiff G. Narayana Raju filed O.S.  34\nof  1951-52  in	 the Court of  District	 Judge,	 Mysore	 for\npartition   and	 separate  possession  of  suit	  properties\nmentioned in the various schedules of the plaint.  The first\ndefendant is the brother\n \nof  the	 plaintiff.  The second defendant is  the  widow  of\nMuniswami  Raju, the eldest brother of the  plaintiff.	 The\nthird	defendant  is  the  legal  representative   of	 the\nplaintiffs  mother.  She is now the, appellant	having	been\nbrought	 on  record  as	 the  legal  representative  of	 the\ndeceased  plaintiff. The case of the original plaintiff	 was\nthat he, the first defendant and Muniswami Raju (husband  of\nthe  second defendant) were the sons of one Gopala Raju	 and\nwere all members of the joint family Gopalaraju died in	 May\n1931  and  after his death the plaintiff  and  his  brothers\ncontinued  to  be members of the joint	family.	  The  joint\nstatus	of  the,  family  was severed  by  the	issue  of  a\nregistered notice by the first defendant to the plaintiff in\nJuly 1951.  An ancestral house in Nazar bad belonging to the\nfamily was acquired by the City IuprovementTrust Board in or\nabout the year 1909.  Out of the compensation paid for	that\nhouse and supplemented by the earnings of the members of the\njoint  family, the house item No. I of Schedule &apos;A&apos;  to	 the\nplaint	was  purchased by Gopalaraju in or  about  the	year\n1910.	Subsequently  item No. 2 of Schedule  &apos;A&apos;  was	also\npurchased by Gopalaraju from the income of item No. I supple\nmented	by the earnings of the members of the  family.	 All\nthe other items of properties mentioned in Schedule &apos;A&apos;	 and\nother Schedules attached to the plaint were acquired out  of\nthe  income  from  items 1 and 2 of  Schedule  &apos;A&apos;,  It	 was\nfurther	 alleged that the business known as \"Ambika  Stores\"\nwas  also the joint family business and all  the  properties\nmentioned in the Schedules except items I and 2 of  Schedule\n&apos;A&apos;  were acquired out of the income of the members  of	 the\nfamily	including  the income from the	business  of  Ambika\nStores.	  The plaintiff accordingly claimed that he and	 the\nfirst defendant would each be entitled to get 5/14ths  share\nand  the second and third defendants would each be  entitled\nto  get	 2/14ths. share.  In the alternative  the  plaintiff\npleaded	 that  if  for any reason the Court  held  that	 the\nproperties stand in the name of Muniswami Raju and were	 not\nacquired with the aidof the joint familv nucleus, he and the\nsecond defendant were entitled to equal shares as  co-owners\nof the joint family business.  The suit was mainly contested\nby  the	 second defendant who asserted that  the  properties\nmentioned  in  all the Schedules of the	 plaint	 were  self-\nacquisitions of Miiniswami Raju and constituted his separate\nproperties.  It was alleged that Muniswami Raju was the only\ncarniiig member of the family at the time of the acquisition\nof items 1 and 2 of Schedule operties and the plaintiff	 and\nthe  first defendant were emploved,in petty jobs  in  Wesley\nPress.	 Muniswami Raju later on employed the  plaintiff  in\nhis  -shop  as	a salaried servant and	the  latter  had  no\nproprietary  right in the business of Ambika Stores.   After\nconsideration  of  the	oral and  documentary  evidence	 the\nDistrict Judge held that the plaintiff, first defendant	 and\nMuniswami  Raju were not divided and that the only  property\nwhich was divisible was item No. I of Schedule\n \n&apos;A&apos;  and  there	 was not sufficient  ancestral	nucleus	 for\nacquisition of the other properties and that all  properties\nexcept item No. 1 of Schedule &apos;A were the self	acquisitions\nof  Muniswami Raju, that Muniswami I Raju never blended	 his\nproperties with that of the joint family that the  plaintiff\nwas  only an employee under Muniswami Raju and therefore  he\nwas not entitled to the alternativ &apos; relief claimed by	him.\nAccordingly, the District Judge granted a preliminary decree\nholding	 that the plaintiff was entitled to 2/7ths share  in\nitem  No. I of Schedule &apos;A&apos;.  The plaintiff took the  matter\nin  appeal to the Mysore High Court.  By its judgment  dated\nMarch  25,  1960 the High Court affirmed the decree  of	 the\ntrial court with the modification that besides item No. I of\nSchedule  &apos;A&apos;  item No. 2 also should be hold  to  be  joint\nfamily property and the plaintiff was entitled to  partition\nof  his share in this item also.  The High  Court  cancelled\nthe  I	direction of the District Judge that  the  plaintiff\nshould	account for the moneys and properties  of  Muniswami\nRaju  -in  his hands before he is given	 possession  of	 his\nshare.\nThis  appeal  is  brought by certificate on  behalf  of	 the\nplaintiff  from the judgment of the Mysore High Court  dated\nMarch 25, 1960 in R.A. No. 155 of 1953.\nThe  first  question  to be considered	in  this  appeal  is\nwhether	 the  business	of  Ambika  Stores  was	 really	 the\nbusiness  of the joint family and whether the plaintiff	 was\nentitled. to a partition of his share in the assets of	that\nbusiness.: It was contended on behalf of the appellant	that\nthe  business of Ambika Stores grew out of a nucleus of	 the\njoint family funds of at least by the efforts of the members\nof  the joint family include the appellant.  The  contention\nof the appellant has been negatived by both the lower courts\nand there is a concurrent finding that the Ambika Stores was\nthe  separate business of Muniswami Raju and it was  neither\nthe  joint  family  business nor  treated  as  joint  family\nbusiness, It is wellestablished that there is no presumption\nunder Hindu law that a business standing in the name of	 any\nmember	of the joint family is a joint family business	even\nif that member is the manager, of the joint family.  Unless,\nit  could  be shown that the business in the  hands  of	 the\ncoparcener  grew up with the assistance of the joint  family\nproperty  or joint family funds or that the earnings of	 the\nbusiness  were	blended with the joint	family	estate,	 the\nbusiness remains free and separate.  The question  therefore\nwhether	 the  business	was begun or  carried  on  with	 the\nassistance of joint family property or joint family funds or\nas  a  -family	business is a  question	 of  fact.-(See	 the\ndecisions of the Judicial Committee in Bhwu Mal v. Jagannath\n(1)  and in Pearey Lal v. Nanak Chand (1) and of this  Court\nin Chattahatha Karayalar v. Ramachandra\n(1)   A.T.R 1943 P.C 40.\n(2)   A.T.R. 1948 P.C  108.\n \nlyer)  (1).   In  the present, case there  is  a  concurrent\nfinding of both the lower courts that the business of Ambika\nStores	was a separate, business of Muniswami Raju  and	 it,\nwas  neither  a joint family business nor treated  as  joint\nfamily business.  The concurrent finding of the lower courts\non  this issue is upon a finding of fact and  following	 the\nusual practice of this Court, it is not now open to  further\nscrutiny by this Court under Art. 133 of the Constitution.\nIt  was, however, contended on behalf of the appellant	that\nthe finding of the lower. courts is vitiated in, law because\nof  the circumstance that they have not taken  into  account\nthree important documents, Ex.	D, Ex.	E and Ex.  DDD.	  We\nare  unable  to	 accept this argument  as  correct.   It  is\nmanifest on a perusal of the judgment of the High Court that\nall  the documents have been examined, regarding  the  issue\nwhether	 the  business of Ambika Stores was a  joint  family\nbusiness  or whether it was p. separate, business  of  Muni-\nswami  Raju.  As regards Ex.  D, the High-,Court has,  after\nexamining the evidence adduced, remarked that the, mere fact\nthat  item No. 2 of Schedule &apos;A was given as a	security  by\nMuniswami Raju did not result in any detriment to the  joint\nfamily	property and, it cannot therefore be held  that	 the\nbusiness of Ambika Stores grew out of the joint family funds\nor with the aid of the joint family funds.  On behalf of the\nappellant  reliance was placed on the recitals in Ex.  E,  a\ndeed of mortgage dated July 26, 1928 executed by Gopalaraju,\nMuniswamiraju  and  the appellant in favour  of	 the  Mysore\nBank.	The  property  that had been  mortgaged	 under	this\ndocument is item No. 2 of Schedule &apos;A&apos;.	 The recital is that\nthe  borrowing from the Bank was for the business and  trade\nof  the	 executants and -for the benefit and  use  of  their\nfamily.	  There is also a recital in an earlier	 portion  of\nthe document that the business, was being carried on for the\nbenefit	 of  the  family, but it is not quite  clear  as  to\nwhether this related to the business carried on by  Narayana\nRaju  or whether it was intended to relate to some  business\ncarried on by all the three executants.	 It is possible that\nthe  appellant had other business of his own carried on	 -on\nhis own. account at that time and it cannot be, assumed that\nthe borrowing under Ex.	 E must have been for the purpose of\nAmbika	Stores.	 It should be noticed that  Muniswarni	Raju\nhas  been  described in the document as	 the  proprietor  of\nAmbika Stores which description is. not consistent with	 the\ncontention  of the appellant that the business, was a  joint\nfamily	business.  The High Court has, in  this	 connection,\nreferred  to Ex.  I an application dated February 14,  1929,\nby  the	 appellant  to the City	 Co-operative  Bank,  Mysore\nwherein, the appellant has said that he was getting a decent\nearning	 by  doing;  out-of-door  commercial  business	with\nAmbika	Stores.	 There is also the, recital in Ex.   I	that\nMuniswami Raju was the proprietor of Ambika Stores.   Having\nregard to this recital in I it is not-\n(1)  A.I.R. 1955 S.C. 799.\n \nunlikely that the appellant had some business of his own  at\nthe  material time and it cannot be assumed  that  borrowing\nunder Ex.  E, was for the purpose of Ambika Stores  business\nonly.  The High Court has also dealt with the effect of	 Ex.\nDDD, mortgage deed produced on behalf of the appellant.	  It\nis  true that in this document the appellant  and  Muniswami\nRaju  have been described as proprietors of  Ambika  Stores.\nThe finding of the High Court is that this recital was	made\nin the document for the purposes of borrowing from the Bank.\nReference was made in this context to a letter dated May  5,\n1931,  Ex.  75 written by Muniswami Raju  as  proprietor  of\nAmbika	Stores to the Bank of Mysore.  In&apos; this	 letter,  he\nhas requested the Bank to take note of the fact that he	 has\nauthorised the appellant to accept drafts, and sign  letters\netc. on behalf of the firm&apos; There is another Letter, Ex. 76,\ndated  April 14, 1934 written by Muniswami Raju to the	Bank\nof  Mysore wherein Muniswami Raju has been described as	 the\nproprietor  of Ambika Stores and there is an  intimation  to\nthe Bank, that the appellant Narayana Raju was authorised to\nsign  for the firm.  In the context and background of  these\ncircumstances  it is evident that though both the  appellant\nand  Muniswami Raju were described as proprietors of  Ambika\nStores the description was only for the purpose of borrowing\nmoney  from the Bank, as contended for by  the	respondents.\nIn  this  connection  the High Court  has  also	 taken	into\naccount Ex. 7 5 (b), a letter written by Muniswami Raju.  In\nthis  letter  Muniswami Raju has described  himself  as	 the\nproprietor of Ambika Stores and has instructed the Bank that\nhe   The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Ramaswami, J. The plaintiff G. Narayana Raju filed O.S. 34 of 1951-52 in the Court of District Judge, Mysore for partition and separate possession of suit properties mentioned in the various schedules of the plaint. The first defendant is the brother of the plaintiff. The second defendant is the widow of Muniswami Raju, the eldest brother of the plaintiff. The third defendant is the legal representative of the plaintiffs mother. She is now the, appellant having been brought on record as the legal representative of the deceased plaintiff. The case of the original plaintiff was that he, the first defendant and Muniswami Raju (husband of the second defendant) were the sons of one Gopala Raju and were all members of the joint family Gopalaraju died in May 1931 and after his death the plaintiff and his brothers continued to be members of the joint family. The joint status of the, family was severed by the issue of a registered notice by the first defendant to the plaintiff in July 1951. An ancestral house in Nazar bad belonging to the family was acquired by the City IuprovementTrust Board in or about the year 1909. Out of the compensation paid for that house and supplemented by the earnings of the members of the joint family, the house item No. I of Schedule \'A\' to the plaint was purchased by Gopalaraju in or about the year 1910. Subsequently item No. 2 of Schedule \'A\' was also purchased by Gopalaraju from the income of item No. I supple mented by the earnings of the members of the family. All the other items of properties mentioned in Schedule \'A\' and other Schedules attached to the plaint were acquired out of the income from items 1 and 2 of Schedule \'A\', It was further alleged that the business known as \"Ambika Stores\" was also the joint family business and all the properties mentioned in the Schedules except items I and 2 of Schedule \'A\' were acquired out of the income of the members of the family including the income from the business of Ambika Stores. The plaintiff accordingly claimed that he and the first defendant would each be entitled to get 5/14ths share and the second and third defendants would each be entitled to get 2/14ths. share. In the alternative the plaintiff pleaded that if for any reason the Court held that the properties stand in the name of Muniswami Raju and were not acquired with the aidof the joint familv nucleus, he and the second defendant were entitled to equal shares as co-owners of the joint family business. The suit was mainly contested by the second defendant who asserted that the properties mentioned in all the Schedules of the plaint were self- acquisitions of Miiniswami Raju and constituted his separate properties. It was alleged that Muniswami Raju was the only carniiig member of the family at the time of the acquisition of items 1 and 2 of Schedule operties and the plaintiff and the first defendant were emploved,in petty jobs in Wesley Press. Muniswami Raju later on employed the plaintiff in his -shop as a salaried servant and the latter had no proprietary right in the business of Ambika Stores. After consideration of the oral and documentary evidence the District Judge held that the plaintiff, first defendant and Muniswami Raju were not divided and that the only property which was divisible was item No. I of Schedule \'A\' and there was not sufficient ancestral nucleus for acquisition of the other properties and that all properties except item No. 1 of Schedule \'A were the self acquisitions of Muniswami Raju, that Muniswami I Raju never blended his properties with that of the joint family that the plaintiff was only an employee under Muniswami Raju and therefore he was not entitled to the alternativ \' relief claimed by him. Accordingly, the District Judge granted a preliminary decree holding that the plaintiff was entitled to 2/7ths share in item No. I of Schedule \'A\'. The plaintiff took the matter in appeal to the Mysore High Court. By its judgment dated March 25, 1960 the High Court affirmed the decree of the trial court with the modification that besides item No. I of Schedule \'A\' item No. 2 also should be hold to be joint family property and the plaintiff was entitled to partition of his share in this item also. The High Court cancelled the I direction of the District Judge that the plaintiff should account for the moneys and properties of Muniswami Raju -in his hands before he is given possession of his share.\r\n\r\n\r\nheld:  the appellant during Muniswami Raju\'s life-time of his being a co-owner of the partnership business, nor is there any evidence of recognition by Muniswami Raju of any such right of the appellant. On the other hand, there is sufficient evidence to show that whatever the appellant did in connection with the business was only done with the Authority conferd by Muniswami Raju. In our opinion the High Court has rightly rejected the claim of the appellant that he was a co-owner of the partnership business.\r\n\r\ncourt  the reason expressed we hold that this appeal has no merit and it must be dismissed with costs.\r\n\r\n Appeal was dismissed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ','Rathnavathi & Anr Vs Kavita Ganashamdas Abhay Manohar Sapre, J.\r\n\r\n1.    Leave granted.\r\n\r\n2.    The plaintiff  filed  two  suits,  one  for  specific  performance  of\r\nagreement and other for grant of permanent injunction  in  relation  to  the\r\nsuit  house.  The  trial  court  vide  common  judgment  and  decree   dated\r\n16.10.2001 dismissed both the suits. The first appellate  court,  i.e.,  the\r\nHigh Court, in appeal, by impugned  judgment  and  decree  dated  08.09.2011\r\nreversed the judgment and decree of the trial court  and  decreed  both  the\r\nsuits in appeal, against the defendants.  Being aggrieved  by  the  judgment\r\nand decree of the High Court, Defendants 1 and 3 have approached this  Court\r\nin the instant civil appeals.\r\n3.    The question arises for consideration in these appeals is whether  the\r\nHigh Court was justified in allowing the  first  appeals  preferred  by  the\r\nplaintiff, resulting in decreeing the two civil suits against defendants  in\r\nrelation to suit house?\r\n4.    In order to appreciate the controversy involved in  the  civil  suits,\r\nand now in these appeals, it is necessary to state the relevant facts.\r\n5.    For the sake of convenience, description of parties  herein  is  taken\r\nfrom Original Suit No.223/2000.\r\n6.    Defendant no.2 is the original owner of the suit house  and  defendant\r\nno.1 is the subsequent purchaser of the suit house from defendant no.2.\r\n7.    The dispute relates to a dwelling house bearing no. 351  Block  no.11,\r\nMatadahalli Extension,  now  known  as  R.T.  Nagar  Bangalore  (hereinafter\r\nreferred to as \" the suit house    ).\r\n8.    The suit house  was  purchased  by  defendant  no.  2  from  Bangalore\r\nDevelopment  Authority  (in  short     BDA   )  in  a  scheme.   On  15.02.1989,\r\nDefendant no. 2 entered into an agreement (Annexure-P-1) with plaintiff  for\r\nsale of suit house at a total consideration of Rs. 3,50,000/-. In  terms  of\r\nclause 2 of the agreement, the plaintiff paid  a  sum  of  Rs.  50,000/-  as\r\nadvance towards sale consideration. These facts are not in dispute.\r\n9.    On  07.01.2000,  the  plaintiff  filed  a  civil  suit  being  OS  No.\r\n223/2000, initially against 3 defendants for  seeking  permanent  injunction\r\nrestraining  the  defendants  jointly  and  severally  from  interfering  in\r\nplaintiff\'s possession over the  suit  house.  In  substance,  case  of  the\r\nplaintiff was  that  she  entered  into  an  agreement  on  15.02.1989  with\r\ndefendant no. 2 to purchase the suit house for Rs.  3,50,000/-  and  paid  a\r\nsum of Rs. 50,000/- to defendant no. 2 by way of advance  towards  the  sale\r\nconsideration. Later, the plaintiff further paid the  balance  consideration\r\nof Rs. 3 Lacs towards the sale price  and  obtained  receipts  acknowledging\r\nthe payment so made. It was  alleged  that  the  plaintiff  was  accordingly\r\nplaced in actual physical possession of the suit house and  since  then  she\r\nhas been in possession of the suit house. It was alleged that she also  made\r\nsome improvements therein by spending money and is  paying  electricity  and\r\nwater charges etc. It was further alleged that the  plaintiff  was  and  has\r\nalways been ready and willing to perform her part of the  agreement  to  get\r\nthe sale deed executed in her favour after having performed her part of  the\r\ncontract. However, defendant no. 2, for the reasons best known to  her,  did\r\nnot  execute  the  sale  deed  despite  having  received   the   full   sale\r\nconsideration from the plaintiff. It was alleged that defendant no.  1,  who\r\nis a total stranger to the  suit  house  and  having  no  right,  title  and\r\ninterest in the suit house, on 2.1.2000 visited the suit  house  along  with\r\ndefendant no.  2  and  some  other  unwanted  elements  and  threatened  the\r\nplaintiff to dispossess her from the suit house. It was  also  alleged  that\r\non 8.1.2000, defendant nos. 1 and 2 again visited and attempted  to  assault\r\nthe plaintiff and unsuccessfully attempted to commit trespass  in  the  suit\r\nhouse.\r\n10.   On seeing the hostile attitude of defendant nos. 1  and  2  and  their\r\nassociates, the plaintiff immediately lodged a complaint  in  the  concerned\r\npolice station. Since police authorities did not take any action, which  was\r\nrequired of, the plaintiff filed the  aforesaid  civil  suit  for  permanent\r\ninjunction restraining the  defendants  from  interfering  in  her  peaceful\r\npossession over the suit house. It was submitted that the  plaintiff  has  a\r\nprima facie case, so also the balance of convenience  and  irreparable  loss\r\nin her favour, which entitles her to claim permanent injunction against  the\r\ndefendants in relation to the suit house. The plaintiff  also  averred  that\r\nshe reserved her right to file a suit for specific performance of  agreement\r\nagainst the defendants.\r\n11.   The aforesaid suit was contested by defendant nos.  1  and  2.   While\r\nadmitting the ownership of defendant no. 2 over the suit house and the  fact\r\nof entering into an agreement  with  the  plaintiff  for  its  sale  to  the\r\nplaintiff and further while admitting the receipt of advance payment  of  Rs\r\n50,000/- from the plaintiff, the defendants denied all material  allegations\r\nmade in the plaint. It was alleged  that  the  plaintiff  did  not  pay  the\r\nbalance consideration as alleged. It was also alleged that defendant  no.  2\r\non 25.10.1995 cancelled the agreement dt 15.02.1989 by sending legal  notice\r\nto the plaintiff and then  sold  the  suit  house  to  defendant  no.  1  on\r\n09.02.1998 for Rs. 4 lacs and placed her in its possession.\r\n12.   On 31.03.2000, the plaintiff filed another civil  suit  being  OS  No.\r\n2334 of 2000 in  the  Court  of  City  Civil  Judge  Bangalore  against  the\r\ndefendants  for  specific  performance  of  agreement  dated  15.02.1989  in\r\nrelation to the suit house.\r\n13.   After pleading the same facts, which are set out above, the  plaintiff\r\nfurther alleged that she has performed her part of the agreement  by  paying\r\nentire sale consideration of Rs. 3,50,000/- and has been  in  possession  of\r\nthe suit house. It was alleged that  on  the  one  hand,  defendant  no.  2,\r\ndespite having received full sale consideration, did not  perform  her  part\r\nof the agreement by not getting the suit house  transferred  in  plaintiff\'s\r\nfavour as per clause 3 of the agreement and by doing the acts which she  was\r\nexpected to do in terms of agreement,  and  on  the  other  hand,  tried  to\r\ninterfere in plaintiff\'s lawful possession over the suit house.\r\n14.   This led the plaintiff to serve upon defendant  no.2  a  legal  notice\r\ndated 6.3.2000 thereby calling upon defendant no.2 to execute the sale  deed\r\nin relation to suit property in plaintiff\'s favour.  Since  despite  service\r\nof legal notice, defendant no. 2  failed  to  execute  the  same,  suit  for\r\nspecific performance was also filed. The plaintiff then by way of  amendment\r\nalso sought to add one prayer for cancellation of sale deed alleged to  have\r\nbeen executed by defendant  no.  2  in  favour  of  defendant  no.  1.  This\r\namendment was allowed.\r\n15.    The  defendants  contested  the  civil  suit.  While  admitting   the\r\nexecution of agreement dated 15.02.1989 with the plaintiff for sale of  suit\r\nhouse for Rs. 3,50,000/- and also admitting payment of Rs. 50,000/-  by  the\r\nplaintiff to defendant no. 2,  the  defendants  denied  all  other  material\r\nallegations and inter alia alleged that since the plaintiff  failed  to  pay\r\nthe balance sale consideration of Rs. 3 lacs to defendant no. 2 in terms  of\r\nthe agreement, defendant no. 2 on 25.10.1995 sent  a  legal  notice  to  the\r\nplaintiff cancelling the agreement dated 15.2.1989 and sold the  suit  house\r\nto defendant no. 1  on  09.02.1998  for  consideration  and  placed  her  in\r\npossession of the suit house. The defendants  also  alleged  that  defendant\r\nno. 1 was the bona fide purchaser for value and hence her  title  cannot  be\r\nquestioned in the suit.\r\n16.   The defendants also contested the suit on two legal grounds.  Firstly,\r\nit was contended that the suit was not maintainable, as  the  bar  contained\r\nin Order II Rule 2 of Code of Civil Procedure,  1908  (hereinafter  referred\r\nto as \'CPC\') did not permit the plaintiff to  file  the  suit  for  specific\r\nperformance of agreement in question against the defendants. It was  alleged\r\nthat relief to claim specific performance of agreement was available to  the\r\nplaintiff when she filed the first suit  (OS  No.  223/2000)  for  permanent\r\ninjunction against the defendants. Yet, the plaintiff failed  to  claim  the\r\nrelief in the first suit, consequently,  the  second  suit  filed  to  claim\r\nspecific performance of agreement in question is hit by rigor  contained  in\r\nOrder II Rule 2 of CPC. It is now barred and hence liable  to  be  dismissed\r\nas not maintainable. Secondly, it was contended that the suit  is  otherwise\r\nbarred by limitation having been filed beyond  the  period  of  three  years\r\nfrom the date of accrual of cause of action as provided  in  Article  54  of\r\nthe Limitation Act, 1963. It was, therefore,  contended  that  the  suit  is\r\nliable to be dismissed as being barred by limitation, as well.\r\n17.   The trial court consolidated both the suits  for  trial.  Issues  were\r\nframed. Parties adduced  evidence.  The  trial  court  vide  judgment/decree\r\ndated 25.8.2009 though  answered  some  issues  in  plaintiff\'s  favour  but\r\neventually dismissed the civil suits. It was held that the  agreement  dated\r\n15.02.1989 was executed between the plaintiff and defendant no. 2  for  sale\r\nof suit house; that the plaintiff was  not  placed  in  possession  of  suit\r\nhouse pursuant to agreement in question; that the plaintiff  was  not  ready\r\nand willing to perform her part of the agreement; that  suit  is  barred  by\r\nlimitation; that the plaintiff was not entitled  to  claim  the  relief  for\r\nspecific performance of agreement; that the plaintiff was  not  entitled  to\r\nclaim the relief for grant of permanent injunction; that defendant no. 1  is\r\na bona fide purchaser of the suit house for value;  that the  plaintiff  was\r\nnot entitled to challenge the sale deed dt. 9.2.1998, that the suit was  hit\r\nby the bar contained in Order II Rule 2 of CPC  because  the  plaintiff  did\r\nnot obtain leave to file second suit for specific performance  while  filing\r\nthe first suit for grant of permanent injunction against the  defendants  in\r\nrelation to the suit house.\r\n18.   Feeling aggrieved, the  plaintiff  filed  two  regular  first  appeals\r\nbeing R.F.A. Nos. 1092 of 2009 and 1094 of 2009 before the  High  Court.  By\r\ncommon impugned judgment/decree, the High Court allowed  both  the  appeals,\r\nreversed the judgment/decree of the trial court and decreed both  the  civil\r\nsuits by passing a decree for specific performance of agreement against  the\r\ndefendants in relation to suit house and also  issued  permanent  injunction\r\nas claimed by the plaintiff. The High Court answered all the  aforementioned\r\nissues in plaintiff\'s favour and against the defendants.\r\n19.   The High Court  in  its  judgment  held  that  the  plaintiff  was  in\r\npossession of suit house; that the  plaintiff  performed  her  part  of  the\r\nagreement; that the plaintiff paid the  entire  sale  consideration  of  Rs.\r\n3,50,000/- to defendant no. 2; that the plaintiff was ready and  willing  to\r\nperform her part of agreement; that defendant no. 2 failed  to  perform  her\r\npart of the agreement thereby rendering her liable to perform  her  part  of\r\nagreement; and that subsequent sale even if  made  by  defendant  no.  2  in\r\nfavour of defendant no. 1 was not binding on the plaintiff  because  it  was\r\nnot bona fide.\r\n20.   The High Court, however, after deciding the issues in  favour  of  the\r\nplaintiff, directed that in order to weigh the equities between the  parties\r\nand keeping in view the price escalation, which is  unavoidable  in  present\r\ndays, the plaintiff will pay an additional sum of Rs. 4 lacs over and  above\r\nRs. 3,50,000/- to defendant no. 2 for obtaining sale deed in her favour.\r\n\r\n 21.  It is against this judgment/decree of the High Court,  the  defendants\r\nhave filed the present appeals by way of special leave petitions.\r\n22.   Mrs. Nalini Chidambaram, learned  Senior  Counsel  appearing  for  the\r\nappellants (defendants) while assailing the legality and correctness of  the\r\nimpugned judgment urged various submissions. Firstly, she  argued  that  the\r\nHigh Court erred in allowing plaintiff\'s  first  appeals,  as  according  to\r\nher, both the appeals were liable to be dismissed by upholding the  judgment\r\n/decree of the trial court which had rightly dismissed the suits.  Secondly,\r\nshe argued that second suit filed for claiming specific performance  of  the\r\nagreement for sale of suit house to the plaintiff was hit by  bar  contained\r\nin Order II Rule 2 of CPC for  the  reason  that  the  plaintiff  failed  to\r\nsecure leave in her first suit and  hence  the  second  suit  filed  by  the\r\nplaintiff for grant of specific performance was not  maintainable.  Thirdly,\r\nshe argued that assuming the second suit was held  maintainable,  even  then\r\nit was barred by limitation prescribed in Article 54 of the Limitation  Act.\r\nIt was  pointed  out  that  cause  of  action  to  file  suit  for  specific\r\nperformance of contract against  the  defendants  arose  in  the  year  1989\r\nitself no sooner 60 days period  expired  from  the  date  of  agreement  as\r\nprovided in clause 2  of  the  agreement,  whereas,  the  suit  in  question\r\nseeking specific performance was filed  in  year  2000  and  hence,  it  was\r\nhopelessly  barred  applying  the  limitation  prescribed  in  Article   54.\r\nFourthly, it was argued that in any case, there was  no  case  made  out  on\r\nevidence by the plaintiff for reversal of the findings relating to grant  of\r\nspecific performance of agreement because the plaintiff  was  neither  ready\r\nnor willing to perform her part of the  agreement  and  nor  there  was  any\r\nevidence to hold in her favour on this material issue. Fifthly,  she  argued\r\nthat there was no evidence to hold that the plaintiff was in  possession  of\r\nthe suit house; rather there was enough evidence to hold that after sale  of\r\nsuit house by defendant no.2 to defendant no.1, it was defendant  no.1,  who\r\nwas in possession. Therefore, it should have been held  that  the  plaintiff\r\nwas not in possession of the suit house, as was rightly held  by  the  trial\r\ncourt. And, lastly she argued that it should have been held with the aid  of\r\nevidence that defendant no. 1 was bona fide purchaser of the suit house  for\r\nvalue, as she purchased it after the owner i.e. defendant  no.  2  cancelled\r\nthe agreement dt 15.2.1989 and then sold the suit house to defendant no.  1.\r\n\r\n23.   After arguing  at  length  with  reference  to  documents  on  record,\r\nlearned counsel for the appellants contended that impugned judgment  /decree\r\ndeserves to be set aside  and  that  of  the  trial  court  be  restored  by\r\ndismissing both the suits filed  by  the  plaintiff.  Learned  counsel  also\r\nrelied upon certain decisions, which we shall refer later.\r\n24.   Mr. P. Vishwanatha Shetty, learned senior counsel for  the  respondent\r\n(plaintiff) supported the impugned judgment /decree and  contended  that  it\r\ndoes not call for any interference. According  to  learned  senior  counsel,\r\nall the findings recorded by the High Court, though of reversal, deserve  to\r\nbe upheld because the High Court, in exercise of its first appellate  powers\r\nunder Section 96 of CPC, rightly appreciated the evidence and  came  to  its\r\nindependent conclusion which it could legally do and which  it  rightly  did\r\nwhile allowing the two first appeals.  Learned  senior  counsel  urged  that\r\nthis Court  while  hearing  these  appeals  cannot  and  rather  should  not\r\nundertake the exercise of appreciating the whole evidence  again  like  that\r\nof the first appeal except to find out whether there is any  apparent  legal\r\nerror in the impugned judgment so as to call for any  interference  by  this\r\nCourt. Learned senior counsel submitted that no such  error  exists  in  the\r\nimpugned judgment and hence these appeals are liable to be dismissed.\r\n25.   Having heard the learned counsel for the parties at  length  and  upon\r\nperusal of the record of the case, we find no merit in these appeals  as  in\r\nour considered opinion, the submissions urged by the learned senior  counsel\r\nfor the appellants, though argued ably, have no force.\r\n26.   Coming first to the legal question as  to  whether  bar  contained  in\r\nOrder II Rule 2 of CPC is attracted so as to non- suit  the  plaintiff  from\r\nfiling  the  suit  for  specific  performance  of  the  agreement,  in   our\r\nconsidered opinion, the bar is not attracted\r\n27.   At the outset, we consider it apposite to take note of law  laid  down\r\nby the Constitution bench of this Court in Gurbux Singh  v.  Bhooralal,  AIR\r\n1964 SC 1810, wherein this Court while explaining the true  scope  of  Order\r\nII Rule  2  of  CPC  laid  down  the  parameters  as  to  how  and  in  what\r\ncircumstances, a plea should be  invoked  against  the  plaintiff.   Justice\r\nAyyangar speaking for the Bench held as under:\r\n   In order that a plea of a  bar  under  Order  2  Rule  2(3)  of  the  Civil\r\nProcedure Code should succeed the defendant who raises the  plea  must  make\r\nout (1) that the second suit was in respect of the same cause of  action  as\r\nthat on which the previous suit was based;  (2)  that  in  respect  of  that\r\ncause of action the plaintiff was entitled to more than one relief;  (3)that\r\nbeing thus entitled to more than one relief  the  plaintiff,  without  leave\r\nobtained from the Court omitted to sue for the relief for which  the  second\r\nsuit had been filed. From this analysis it would be seen that the  defendant\r\nwould have to establish primarily and to start with, the  precise  cause  of\r\naction upon which the previous suit was filed, for unless there is  identity\r\nbetween the cause of action on which the earlier suit was filed and that  on\r\nwhich the claim in the later suit is based there would be no scope  for  the\r\napplication of the bar      \r\n                                   (Emphasis supplied)\r\n\r\n28.   This Court has consistently followed the aforesaid enunciation of  law\r\nin later years and reference to only one of such recent decisions  in  Virgo\r\nIndustries (Eng.) P. Ltd. Vs Venturetech Solutions P.  Ltd.,  (2013)  1  SCC\r\n625, would suffice, wherein this Court reiterated the principle  of  law  in\r\nfollowing words:\r\n   The cardinal requirement for application of  the  provisions  contained  in\r\nOrder II Rules 2(2) and (3), therefore, is that the cause of action  in  the\r\nlater suit must be the same  as  in  the  first  suit.  It  will  be  wholly\r\nunnecessary to enter into any discourse on the  true  meaning  of  the  said\r\nexpression, i.e. cause  of  action,  particularly,  in  view  of  the  clear\r\nenunciation in a recent judgment of this  Court  in  the  Church  of  Christ\r\nCharitable Trust and Educational  Charitable  Society,  represented  by  its\r\nChairman   v.   Ponniamman   Educational   Trust    represented    by    its\r\nChairperson/Managing Trustee  JT  2012  (6)  SC  149.  The  huge  number  of\r\nopinions  rendered  on  the  issue  including  the  judicial  pronouncements\r\navailable does not fundamentally detract from what is stated  in  Halsbury\'s\r\nLaws of England, (4th Edition). The following reference from the above  work\r\nwould, therefore, be apt for being extracted herein below:\r\n\r\n       Cause of Action    has been defined as meaning simply a  factual  situation\r\nexistence of which entitles one person to obtain from  the  Court  a  remedy\r\nagainst another person. The phrase has been held from the earliest  time  to\r\ninclude every fact which is material to be proved to entitle  the  Plaintiff\r\nto succeed, and  every  fact  which  a  Defendant  would  have  a  right  to\r\ntraverse. \'Cause of action    has also been  taken  to  mean  that  particular\r\naction on the part of the Defendant which gives the Plaintiff his  cause  of\r\ncomplaint, or the subject-matter  of  grievance  founding  the  action,  not\r\nmerely the technical cause of action.   \r\n\r\n29.   In the instant case when we apply  the  aforementioned  principle,  we\r\nfind that bar contained in Order II Rule 2 is not attracted because  of  the\r\ndistinction in the cause of action for filing the two suits. So far  as  the\r\nsuit for permanent injunction is concerned, it was based on a  threat  given\r\nto the plaintiff by the defendants to dispossess her from the suit house  on\r\n2.1.2000 and 9.1.2000. This would be clear  from  reading  Para  17  of  the\r\nplaint. So far as cause of action to file suit for specific  performance  of\r\nagreement is concerned, the same was based on non performance  of  agreement\r\ndated 15.2.1989 by defendant no. 2  in  plaintiff\'s  favour  despite  giving\r\nlegal notice dated 6.3.2000 to defendant no. 2 to perform her part.\r\n30.   In our considered opinion, both the suits were, therefore, founded  on\r\ndifferent causes of action and hence could be filed  simultaneously.  Indeed\r\neven  the  ingredients  to  file  the  suit  for  permanent  injunction  are\r\ndifferent than that of the suit for specific performance of agreement\r\n31.   In case of former, plaintiff is required to make out the existence  of\r\nprima facie case, balance of convenience and irreparable loss likely  to  be\r\nsuffered by the plaintiff on facts with reference to the  suit  property  as\r\nprovided in Section 38 of the Specific  Relief  Act,  1963  (in  short     the\r\nAct   ) read with Order 39 Rule 1 &amp; 2 of CPC. Whereas, in case of  the  later,\r\nplaintiff is required to  plead  and  prove  her  continuous  readiness  and\r\nwillingness to perform her part of  agreement  and  to  further  prove  that\r\ndefendant failed to perform her  part  of  the  agreement  as  contained  in\r\nSection 16 of The Act.\r\n32.   One of the basic requirements for successfully invoking  the  plea  of\r\nOrder II Rule 2 of CPC is that the defendant of  the  second  suit  must  be\r\nable to show that the second suit was also in respect of the same  cause  of\r\naction as that on which the previous suit was based.\r\n33.   As mentioned supra, since in the case on hand, this basic  requirement\r\nin relation to cause of action is not made out, the  defendants  (appellants\r\nherein) are not entitled to raise a plea of bar contained in Order  II  Rule\r\n2 of CPC to successfully non suit the plaintiff from  prosecuting  her  suit\r\nfor specific performance of the agreement against the defendants.\r\n 34.  Indeed when the cause of action to claim the respective  reliefs  were\r\ndifferent so also the ingredients for  claiming  the  reliefs,  we  fail  to\r\nappreciate as to how a plea of Order II  Rule  2  could  be  allowed  to  be\r\nraised by the defendants and how it was sustainable on such facts.\r\n 35.  We cannot accept the submission of  learned  senior  counsel  for  the\r\nappellants when she contended that  since  both  the  suits  were  based  on\r\nidentical pleadings and when cause of action to sue for relief  of  specific\r\nperformance of agreement was available to the plaintiff prior to  filing  of\r\nthe first suit, the second suit was hit by bar contained in Order II Rule  2\r\nof CPC.\r\n36.   The submission has a fallacy for two basic reasons. Firstly,  as  held\r\nabove, cause of action in two suits being different,  a  suit  for  specific\r\nperformance could not have been instituted on the basis of cause  of  action\r\nof the first The question arises for consideration in these appeals is whether the High Court was justified in allowing the first appeals preferred by the plaintiff, resulting in decreeing the two civil suits against defendants in relation to suit house?- In order to appreciate the controversy involved in the civil suits, and now in these appeals, it was necessary to state the relevant facts- The dispute relates to a dwelling house -The suit house was purchased by defendant no. 2 from Bangalore Development Authority (in short BDA) in a scheme- Defendant no. 2 entered into an agreement with plaintiff for sale of suit house at a total consideration of Rs. 3,50,000/-- In terms of clause 2 of the agreement, the plaintiff paid a sum of Rs. 50,000/- as advance towards sale consideration-These facts are not in dispute- the plaintiff filed a civil suit being For injuction-Though this litigation was not between inter se owner and subsequent purchaser of the suit house yet in order to do substantial justice between the parties and to see the end of this long litigation and to prevent a fresh suit being instituted by defendant no.1 against defendant no.2 for refund of sale consideration which will again take years to decide and lastly when neither it involve any intricate adjudication of facts, nor it is going to cause any prejudice to the parties, we consider it just and proper to invoke our power under Article 142 of the Constitution of India in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case as narrated above and accordingly direct defendant no. 2 (owner of the suit house) to refund Rs. 4 lacs to defendant no. 1 within three months after execution of sale deed by them in favour of plaintiff pursuant to the impugned judgment/decree- failure to refund the amount within three months, would carry interest at the rate of 9% payable on the unpaid amount from the date of this order till recovery and defendant no. 1, in the event of non-payment by defendant no. 2, would be entitled to levy execution against defendant no. 2 for realization of outstanding money along with interest as awarded treating this order to be a decree in appropriate executing court in accordance with law- Held- These appeals were accordingly disposed of-  No costs. Disposed off','Ranjana Vs State Of Maharashtra &amp; Ors      This appeal arises out of the judgment and order, dated 28th\n\nNovember, 2002, in Writ Petition No. 5058 of 2002, delivered by a\n\nDivision Bench of the High Court of Judicature of Bombay at\n\nAurangabad. By the impugned order, the High Court has dismissed\n\nappellant&apos;s petition questioning the correctness of the orders passed\n\nby the Caste Scrutiny Committee, which had invalidated the claim of\n\nthe appellant as belonging to the \"Mahar\" caste, finally resulting in\n\nher disqualification as a Member of the Zilla Parishad, Aurangabad.\n\n     In order to appreciate the issue, requiring determination, a few\n\nmaterial facts may be stated:\n\n     The appellant was born on 29th May, 1976 to Namdeo Nathaiji\n\nBagul and Zalabai Bagul, a farmer \"Mahar\" family. On 22nd April,\n1996, she married Babasaheb Nana Sature, a resident of Village\n\nJategaon according to \"Boudh\" rites.\n\n     In January, 2002, elections to the Zilla Parishad, Aurangabad\n\nwere announced and in the said election, the Constituency of\n\n&apos;10-Mahalgaon Circle&apos; was reserved for a Scheduled Caste citizen.\n\nOn 31st January, 2002, the appellant approached the Sub-Divisional\n\nOfficer, Vaijapur and obtained a Caste Certificate declaring that she\n\nbelonged to \"Mahar\" caste, a listed Scheduled Caste in the\n\nConstitution (Schedule Castes) Order, 1950 for the State of\n\nMaharashtra. On the basis of her Caste Certificate, the appellant\n\nfiled the nomination form as a candidate of the Shiv Sena Party to\n\ncontest for the 10-Mahalgaon Circle Seat. On 18th February, 2002,\n\nthe appellant was declared elected.\n\n     On 5th March, 2002, a complaint was lodged before the District\n\nCollector, Aurangabad by Smt. Kavita Anna Bagul, one of the\n\ndefeated candidates, alleging that the appellant was disqualified to\n\ncontest the elections as a Scheduled Caste candidate because she\n\nwas born in a Christian family and professed Christianity. On 14th\n\nMarch, 2002, another complaint on the same lines was filed by\n\nRamesh Khandagale, General Secretary, Republican Party of India.\n\n     The Collector     referred   appellant&apos;s   caste   certificate   for\n\nvalidation to the Caste Scrutiny Committee (\"the Committee\", for\n\n\n\n \nshort), which in turn got a vigilance inquiry conducted. After the\n\nsubmission of the vigilance report, the appellant filed her defence\n\nstatement. To substantiate their respective claims before the\n\nCommittee,    the   appellant   and   the   complainants    adduced\n\ndocumentary and oral evidence. The Committee by a majority view\n\nof 2 : 1, vide its order dated 25th October, 2002/18th November, 2002\n\nreturned the finding that though the appellant was born in a \"Mahar\"\n\ncaste, but her family professed Christianity inasmuch as the\n\nappellant was baptized on 27th October, 1977, when she was one\n\nyear old; she was married in a Christian family and her contention\n\nthat she had embraced Buddhism on 23rd August, 1988 was not\n\nestablished. Thus, her claim that she belonged to \"Mahar\" caste (a\n\nScheduled Caste) was rejected.\n\n     Aggrieved by the order of the Committee, the appellant\n\npreferred a writ petition in the High Court, challenging the\n\ncorrectness of the findings of the Committee. It was pleaded on\n\nbehalf of the appellant that she was born in a \"Hindu Mahar\" family;\n\nher school record shows that she was a Hindu; later on she\n\nembraced Buddhism on 23rd August, 1988; there was no Baptism\n\nceremony on 27th October, 1977 and that her marriage as also of\n\nher brothers and sisters were solemnised as per Boudh traditions.\n\n\n\n\n \n     Tracing the origin of \"Mahars\", one of the socially backward\n\nclasses in Rural Maharashtra, the High Court noted the factum of\n\nlarge scale conversions of socially backward classes in the rural\n\nareas of Maharashtra to Christianity. The High Court also noticed\n\nthe amendment carried out in the Constitution (Scheduled Castes)\n\nOrder, 1950, by the Act No.15 of 1999, whereby and whereunder\n\nthe persons who had converted themselves to \"Buddhism\" were\n\nheld eligible for the benefit of reservation as available to the\n\nScheduled Castes from 1999 onwards. Taking into consideration the\n\nevidence on record, including the entries in the Baptism Register,\n\nthe High Court observed thus:\n\n     \"Reading the Baptism register and the entries thereof in\n     respect of the petitioner on 27.10.1977, with the\n     provisions of Canon Law as reproduced hereinabove, we\n     have no doubt in our mind that the petitioner&apos;s parents\n     professed Christianity when the petitioner was baptised at\n     the age of one year and she was born to Christian\n     parents. It is obvious that the petitioner&apos;s parents continue\n     with their caste identity namely \"Mahar caste\" but that by\n     itself would not be sufficient to hold that the petitioner did\n     not Profess Christianity and she was all along a \"Mahar\n     Hindu / Buddhist\".\n\n     In so far as the stand of the appellant that she had embraced\n\nBuddhism on her marriage is concerned, the High Court observed\n\nas under:\n\n           \"It appears that the petitioner was aware of the legal\n     position, namely: on reconversion to Buddhism or\n     Hinduism she can enter into the fold of Scheduled Castes\n     and she took the plea regarding her reconversion to\n\n \n     Buddhism. In support of this defence, she relied on the\n     certificate purportedly issued by Bhadant. This Dhamma\n     Dhiksha Certificate is purportedly dated 23.8.2002 by the\n     said Bhadant. The Committee had issued a notice calling\n     upon the said person to appear before it. In spite of receipt\n     of the notice, the said Bhadant did not appear before the\n     Committee on 30.8.2002. T  Civil  - Validity of Order - Dismissal of Appellant\'s request of scrutinizing the accuracy of the requests go by the Caste Scrutiny Committee, which had negated the claim of the Appellant as having a place with the \"Mahar\" position - Hence Appeal \r\n\r\nHeld, Finding of the Committee that the Appellant is not a Scheduled Caste, being basically a finding of actuality, it is not a fit case for exercise of ward under Article 136 of the Constitution - Though the High Court has found the section with respect to Appellant\'s Baptism to have been made in the typical course of Baptism, however the passage does not fundamentally demonstrate the way that her folks had likewise changed over to Christianity - Matter remanded [para 12, 14] ','Noor Salman Makani Vs Union Of India (Jayachandra The Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nK.  JAYACHANDRA REDDY, J.- Leave granted in SLP	 (Crl.)	 No.\n1484 of 1993.\n2.   In	 both  these  matters, Noor  Salman  Makani  who  is\ndetained  under Section 3 of the COFEPOSA Act,	1974  (&apos;Act&apos;\nfor  short) is the petitioner.	The petitioner is a  citizen\nof  India.   On	 August	 26, 1992  he  was  travelling	from\nCalcutta  to Hong Kong by Thai International Airways  Flight\nNo. TC314.  After completing the immigration formalities, he\napproached  the Customs counter for clearance.	The  Customs\nauthorities   opened  his  briefcase  and   recovered	huge\nquantities  of	foreign exchange of various  countries,	 the\nvalue of which is estimated at Rs 38,06,930.  On August	 27,\n1992  he was produced under arrest before the  CJM,  Barasat\nand his application for bail was rejected.  On September 19,\n1992 an order of detention dated September\n \n18,  1992  was	served on him in the  jail  along  with	 the\ngrounds	 of  detention.	 On October 1,	1992  a	 declaration\nunder  Section 9(1) of the Act was issued and the  same	 was\nserved	on the detenu on October 13, 1992.  On	October	 15,\n1992  the  petitioner made a representation to	the  Central\nGovernment   against  the  declaration	but  the  same	 was\nrejected.   On	December  28, 1992  the	 petitioner  made  a\nrepresentation	before the Advisory Board but that was	also\nrejected.  Thereafter he filed a writ of habeas corpus and a\nDivision  Bench	 of the Calcutta High  Court  dismissed	 the\nsame.	As against the said order the present SLP  in  which\nleave is granted, has been filed.  A separate Writ  Petition\n(Crl.)	No.  261 of 1993 questioning the  declaration  under\nSection	 9(1)  of the Act has also been filed  stating	that\ncertain	 new facts have come to light which  invalidate	 the\ndeclaration.   The  detention  order is	 questioned  on	 the\nground	 that	there	was   delay   in   considering	 the\nrepresentation	and  also on the ground that  the  detaining\nauthority has not duly considered the circumstance that	 the\ndetenu	was  already  in jail and has  simply  made  a	bald\nstatement in the grounds stating that \"there is	 possibility\nof  the	 detenu being released on bail\" and the	 same  shows\nthat there is non-application of mind.\n3.   From the records it appears that the representation  of\nthe  detenu addressed to the Joint Secretary, COFEPOSA,	 New\nDelhi was forwarded by Dum Dum Central Jail authority  under\nregistered  post on October 15, 1992 and it was received  by\nthe  Ministry&apos;s	 Office	 on  October 22,  1992	and  it	 was\nforwarded  to  the Sponsoring Unit on October 23,  1992	 who\nreceived  it on October 26, 1992.  After  offering  parawise\ncomments  the same was sent by speed post to the  Ministry&apos;s\nOffice	on  October  29,  1992 which  was  received  by	 the\nMinistry&apos;s  Office on November 2, 1992.	 The  representation\nwas  put up before the Joint Secretary on November  3,	1992\nand the same was rejected on November 4, 1992.	The  Finance\nSecretary recommended the rejection of the representation on\nNovember  5,  1992  and finally	 the  Minister	for  Finance\nrejected the same on the same day and a memo dated  November\n6,  1992 was issued to the petitioner intimating  him  about\nthe rejection.\n4.   Learned  counsel appearing for the	 petitioner  submits\nthat the delay between October 15, 1992 and November 2, 1992\nhas  not  been satisfactorily explained and hence  is  fatal\nbeing violative of Article 22(5) of the Constitution.  It is\nalso  his submission that the delay of every day has  to  be\nexplained  as held by the courts.  He relied on some of	 the\njudgments of this Court including Rama Dhondu Borade v. V.K.\nSaraf,	Commissioner of Police&apos;.  There is no doubt that  in\nmany  cases  this Court has reiterated that  the  right	 and\nobligation to make and to consider the representation at the\nearliest  opportunity is a constitutional  imperative  which\ncannot	be curtailed or abridged but in considering  whether\nthere  was  undue and unexplained delay, the facts  in	each\ncase have to be examined.  In Rama Dhondu Borade case&apos;	this\nCourt observed thus: (SCC p. 180, para 20)\n	      \"True,  there is no prescribed  period  either\n	      under  the provisions of the  Constitution  or\n	      under the concerned detention law within which\n	      the\n	      1	 (1989) 3 SCC 173: 1989 SCC (Cri)  520:	 AIR\n	      1989 SC 1861\n \n	      representation should be dealt with.  The	 use\n	      of the words &apos;as soon as may be&apos; occurring  in\n	      Article  22(5)  of the  Constitution  reflects\n	      that    the    representation    should	  be\n	      expeditiously considered and disposed of	with\n	      due promptitude and diligence and with a sense\n	      of urgency and without avoidable delay.	What\n	      is  reasonable dispatch depends on  the  facts\n	      and circumstances of each case and no hard and\n	      fast  rule  can be laid down in  that  regard.\n	      However,	in case the gap between the  receipt\n	      of the representation and its consideration by\n	      the authority is so unreasonably long and	 the\n	      explanation  offered  by the authority  is  so\n	      unsatisfactory,  such delay could vitiate	 the\n	      order of detention.\"\nIn  the above case the gap between receipt and	disposal  of\nthe representation was 28 days but up to the date of service\nof the order of rejection, the delay amounted to 32 days and\nthe court was not satisfied with the explanation offered and\nit was only after a delay of 14 days that the representation\nwas disposed of and the only explanation was that some	more\ninformation  was  called  for and that	there  were  certain\nholidays  in  between.	The Court held that  the  delay	 was\nunreasonable   and  the	 explanation   was   unsatisfactory.\nRelying	 on these observations, the learned counsel  submits\nthat in the instant case the period between October 15, 1992\nand  October  22,  1992 and between  October  23,  1992	 and\nNovember  2, 1992 amounted to undue and	 unexplained  delay.\nBut  if	 we  examine  the facts it  can	 be  seen  that	 the\nrepresentation	was forwarded by the Jail Superintendent  on\nOctober	 15,  1992 itself by registered post  but  that	 was\nreceived  on October 22, 1992 by the Ministry&apos;s	 Office	 and\nthe  entire delay was due to the delay in  postal  delivery.\nTherefore  the	same cannot be said to be  unreasonable	 and\nunexplained.   With regards the period between	October	 23,\n1992  and  November  2,	 1992  there  were  intervening	 two\nSaturdays  and	two  Sundays.  However, on  receipt  of	 the\nrepresentation on October 22, 1992 the same was forwarded on\nOctober	 23, 1992 for parawise comments.  In  this  context,\nthe High Court also has noted that to offer parawise remarks\nit  would  have taken some time because	 the  representation\ncontained   several   allegations   against   the    Customs\nauthorities and necessary information had to be gathered for\noffering  the remarks.	The Sponsoring Unit received  it  on\nOctober 26, 1992 and with the parawise remarks forwarded the\nsame by speed post to the Ministry on October 29, 1992.	  In\nbetween	 there	were two  AIR 1994 SC 575. \r\n\r\nProtection of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act (52 of 1974), S.3 - Representation by detenu - Received late by Ministry\'s office because of postal deferral - Parawise remarks made by supporting power - Representation containing a few assertions against traditions power - Necessary data accumulated for offering comments - Delay of five days by supporting power in sending it to Ministry\'s office in the wake of barring occasions - Not undue. \r\n\r\nConstitution of India, Art.22(5). \r\n\r\nPreservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act (52 of 1974), S.3 - Detention - Detenu as of now in prison - Bald explanation made all together that probability of detenu\'s discharge on safeguard couldn\'t be discounted - Detenu really discharged on safeguard consequently - Detention not rendered unlawful. \r\n\r\nPreservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act (52 of 1974), S.9 - Declaration - Detenu as of now in prison - Subsequent arrival of detenu on safeguard subject to specific conditions - Order of safeguard not imperative archive - Declaration not obligated to be put aside on ground that such request was not set before power before making affirmation. \r\n\r\nProtection of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act (52 of 1974), S.9 - Declaration - Subsequent withdrawal of admission by detenu - Retraction observed to be bit of hindsight - Non-putting of such withdrawal before pronouncing power - Subjective fulfillment of power not vitiated.

Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a Division Bench of the\n\nBombay High Court, Aurangabad Bench dismissing the appeals filed by\n\nseveral accused persons. The present appeal is by original accused No. 6\n\n\n\n\n \n(hereinafter referred to as the A6). He was convicted for various offences\n\npunishable under the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short the `IPC&apos;) and\n\nsentenced to undergo custodial imprisonment and fine with default\n\nstipulation. The High Court dismissed the appeal so far as the present\n\nappellant is concerned, we are not concerned with the other appeals.\n\n\n\n3.    Prosecution version in a nutshell is as follows:\n\n\n\n      A.S.I. Yadav Satpute(P.W. 11) who was attached to police station,\n\nPathardi and was on duty as a Police Station officer on 7.3.1998, received a\n\nphone call at about 2230 hrs. informing him that there was stone pelting at\n\nRangar Galli and, therefore, he sent the necessary police force. He made an\n\nentry at sr. no. 30 in the station diary and at about 10.45 p.m. sent a message\n\nto the Control Room and the other police stations. An entry in this behalf\n\nwas recorded in the station diary at sr. no. 32. Sanjay Shahane (P.W. 4)\n\ncame to the police station and A.S.I. Satpute (P.W. 11) recorded the report\n\nof&apos; Sanjay (P.W. 4) at Exh. 125. An entry in this behalf was accordingly\n\nmade in the station diary at sr. no.33. Sanjay Shahane (P.W. 4) immediately\n\nleft the police station on receiving message that his uncle Jaikumar (P.W. 2)\n\n\n\n\n \nhad become unconscious. Thereafter at about 2355 hrs., original accused\n\nNo.13 Pratibha came to the police station and gave a report in respect of a\n\nnon-cognizable offence. An entry in respect thereof was made in the station\n\ndiary at sr. no. 34. Original accused No.10 Amol and juvenile offender\n\nRama were referred to the hospital as they had sustained minor injuries. The\n\nXerox copy of the entries in the station diary are Exh. 156. A.P.I. Shinde\n\n(P.W. 12) who was also attached to Police Station, Pathardi took over the\n\ninvestigation of Crime No.33 of 1998 from A.S.I. P.W. 11 Satpute as the\n\ncrime had been registered on the basis of the first information report of\n\nSanjay Shahane (P.W.4). A.P.I. Shinde (P.W. 12) received a copy of the\n\nstatement of Digambar (P.W. 1). On 8.3.1998, A.P.I. Shinde accordingly\n\nvisited the mortuary and drew the inquest panchnama of the dead bodies of\n\nDhananjay and Santosh vide inquest panchnamas at Exhs. 116 and 117 in\n\nthe presence of witnesses. Thereafter on the same day he visited the scene of\n\nthe offence at about 9.30 A.M. and drew the scene of the offence\n\npanchnama at Exh. 111 in the presence of P.W. 1 Digambar. The scene of\n\nthe offence was pointed out by P.W. 4 Sanjay Shahane and the spot is a\n\nnarrow lane to the south of the main road of Pathardi. The narrow lane\n\nwhich is the scene of the offence is known as Rangar Galli. Deceased\n\n\n\n\n \nDhananjay had been killed in front of the house of one Pandurang Kasar\n\nwhile deceased Sanjay had been killed in front of the house of one\n\nBhagirath Bajaj. The lane was of a width of about 4 ft. with stone flooring.\n\nDried bloodstains were noticed in front of the house of Bhagirath Bajaj as\n\nwell as in front of the house of Pandurang Kasar. The distance between the\n\ntwo spots where the murder of deceased Sanjay and deceased Dhananjay\n\nhad been committed is at about 10 ft. The spot panchnama further records\n\nthat at a distance of 25 ft. house of one Vilas Rodi is situated and an electric\n\nbulb is affixed on the door of his house. At a distance of 30 ft. towards the\n\nsouthern side, there is an electric pole with tube light.

','Bhagwan Singh &amp; Ors Vs State Of M.P SETHI, J.\n\n	The appellants, alongwith two others, were charged under Sections 148, 302, 336, 337, 427 read\nwith Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code by the Court of Additional Sessions Judge, Burhanpur and after\ntrial acquitted by the trial court vide its judgment dated 24th June, 1987.  The appeal filed by the State\nagainst the order of acquittal was allowed by the High Court vide the judgment impugned convicting the\nappellants for offences under Section 302/149 and sentencing them to life imprisonment besides paying a\nfine of Rs.5,000/- each in default of which they have been directed to suffer further rigorous imprisonment\nfor one year each.  They were also convicted for the commission of offence under Section 148 IPC and\nsentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year each.\n\n	Not satisfied with the judgment of the High Court, the appellants have preferred this appeal under\nSection 379 of the Code of Criminal Procedure read with Order XXI Rules 12 to 29 of the Supreme Court\nRules, 1966.\n\n	According to the prosecution there was a dispute between Amarnath (deceased) and Ram Singh,\nappellant with respect to four mango trees grown on Khasra No.212 situated at Village Sarai.  Litigation\nwas pending between both the parties and police had registered several cases under Sections 147 and 145 of\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure.	 According to the FIR recorded on the statement of PW22 Jagdish that he\nalong with his family members was watching TV at his house.  Amarnath and Hari Ram were also there.\nWhen he was about to start his meals, they heard the cries of \"Bachao-Bachao\" (save-save) raised by\nSurender.  They saw all the 16 accused persons assaulting Surender with lathis, Dhariya, Khartaliya and\nPata.  When Hari Ram went to intervene, the accused attacked him.  Similarly when Amarnath went\nforward he was also assaulted.	Ram Singh instigated other accused persons to finish Amarnath saying that\nas he was responsible for everything, he should be finished today.  Thereafter Ram Singh, Bhagwan Singh,\nSardar Singh, Roop Singh and Dhyansingh attacked Amarnath with lethal weapons in their possession.\nWitness rushed forward to save his father and was also attacked by the aforesaid accused persons.  He ran\naway to the house to save himself.  The accused then threw stones on the house which broke roof tiles,\ndoors and also damaged the walls.  After registration of the FIR, the investigating officers sent the injured,\nnamely, Surender and Hari Ram to the District Hospital, Khandwa where they died the same night, the\ninformation of which was sent to the police by Hospital Authorities.  Mukesh was also found injured and\nsent for treatment to the hospital.  In the occurrence three persons, namely, Surender, Hari Ram and\nAmarnath were murdered and some of the witnesses injured.\n\n	The trial court acquitted the accused persons on finding that appellants Bhagwan Singh, Ram\nSingh, Roop Singh had received injuries and \"seeing danger of life and other accused utilised right of\nprivate defence and there aggressors died and rest aggressors fled away.  Hence the act of the accused fall\nwithin the definition of right of private defence u/s 100 IPC and their act is not punishable according to\nprovisions of section 96 IPC\".	The trial court further held, \"I find that prosecution failed to prove case\nbeyond reasonable doubts and accused committed murder of deceased Amarnath, Surender and Hariram\nand caused injuries to Mukesh witness and damaged house of Jagdish after throwing stones\". Holding that\nthe prosecution had failed to prove the offence against accused beyond all reasonable doubts and giving\nthem the benefit of right of self-defence, as contemplated under Section 100 IPC, he acquitted the accused\npersons.\n\n	The High Court rightly found that the trial court had been led astray by the simple fact that the\ninjuries on the person of the accused had not been explained by the prosecution witnesses.  After referring\nto number of judgments of this Court, the High Court concluded:\n\n\"In view of what we have discussed about the circumstances\nof the case, the injuries on the persons of the three\ndeceased, the sequence in which the witnesses reached the\nspot of crime, minor nature of the injuries on the persons\nof the accused except one injury on the head of Bhagwan\nSingh and the background and also the sequence in which the\ndeceased were attacked, rules out any possibility of the\naccused having attacked the three deceased in exercise of\nself-defence of any of them.  It is clear that the accused\npersons were the aggressors.\"\n\n\n	After critically and minutely examining the evidence on record,\nthe High Court found that the presence of eye-witnesses, namely, Kiran\n(PW7), Mukesh (PW12) and Jagdish (PW22) cannot be doubted.  In this\nregard the court held:\n\n\"A striking feature of this case is that one of the accused\nSardarsingh lodged a report Ex.D-5 at 11.30 p.m. that 4\npersons i.e. Amarnath, Jagdish, Surendra and Hariram were\nassaulting Bhagwansingh and Roopsingh.	Even here Jagdish\nwitness was shown present and there was no mention of\nRamsingh accused.  Then in cross examination to these three\neye-witnesses the suggestions have been that the deceased\nand the witnesses along with others assaulted the accused at\nthe house of Ramsingh.	The trial court has ignored this\ntrend of cross examination on behalf of the accused in\nappreciating whether the witnesses were present at the scene\nof violence.  In the facts and circumstances of a given\ncase, the trend of cross-examination by defence or\nprosecution witness can provide support to the inference if\nsome accused and witnesses were present at the scene of\ncrime.	The most striking feature is the fact that such a\nreport was recorded by the police and they at one proceeded\nto the scene of crime.	There is no mention in Ex.D-5 if any\nserious injury was given to Sardarsingh or Roopsing and\nwhether any weapon has been used or only fists blows were\nbeing exchanged.  Still the police rushed to the scene of\ncrime at the night.  This is rare.  This indicates that\nthere was some under current working between the police and\nthe accused persons.  The police could not but have recorded\nthe Dehati Nalishi on finding one person died and 2 in the\nprocess of dying with fatal injuries.  This is followed by\nlapse of the investigating officer in recorded statement of\nMukesh and Kiran after 7 days if Kiran had not witnesses the\noccurrence there was no need to introduce her as a witness\nwhen there were witnesses such as Jagdish and Mukesh whose\npresence at that spot could hardly be challenged.  So, if\nanything, investigation was unfair towards the complainant\nparty and not against the accused persons.\"\n\nand concluded:\n\n\"So we find the testimony of these witnesses, trustworthy\nand also confirmatory to each other.  Their presence is\nestablished at the scene of crime.  Their testimony is\ncorroborated by FIR and by medical evidence.\"\n\n	We do not agree with the submissions of the learned counsel for\nthe appellants that under Section 378 of the Code of Criminal Procedure\nthe High Court could not disturb the finding of facts of the trial court\neven if it found that the view taken by the trial court was not proper.\nOn the basis of the pronouncements of this Court, the settled position\nof law regarding the powers of the High Court in an appeal against an\norder of acquittal is that the Court has full powers to review the\nevidence upon which an order of acquittal is based and generally it will\nnot interfere with the order of acquittal because by passing an order of\nacquittal the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused is\nreinforced.  The golden thread which runs through the web of\nadministration of justice in criminal case is that if two views are\npossible on the evidence adduced in the case, one pointing to the guilt\nof the accused and the other to his innocence, the view which is\nfavourable to the accused should be adopted.  Such is not a jurisdiction\nlimitation on the appellate court but a Judge made guidelines for\ncircumspection.	 The paramount consideration of the court is to ensure\nthat miscarriage of justice is avoided.	 A miscarriage of justice which\nmay arise from the acquittal of guilty is no less than from the\nconviction of an innocent.  In a case where the trial court has taken a\nview ignoring the admissible evidence, a duty is cast upon the High\nCourt to reappreciate the evidence in acquittal appeal for the purposes\nof ascertaining as to whether all or any of the accused has committed\nany offence or not.  Probable view taken by the trial court which may\nnot be disturbed in the appeal is such a view which is based upon legal\nand admissible evidence.  In the instant case the trial court acquitted\nthe respondents by not re Code of Criminal Procedure - area 379 - Supreme Court Rules - Order XXI Rules 12 to 29 - advance under - Indian Penal Code - Sections 148, 302, 336, 337, 427 read with Section 149 - offenses under - conviction and sentence under the settled position of law in regards to the forces of the High Court in an interest against a request of quittance is that the court has full powers to survey the proof whereupon a request or vindication is based and for the most part it won\'t meddle with the request of absolution in light of the fact that by passing a request of exoneration the assumption guiltlessness for the denounced is strengthened - for a situation where the trial court has taken a view overlooking the allowable confirmation, an obligation is provided reason to feel ambiguous about the High Court to reappreciate the proof in quittance advance for the motivations behind learning concerning whether all or any of the charged has perpetrated any offense or not - the trial court wrongly held that the respondents were supported in bringing on the demise of three people in practice of their privilege of self-preservation - no legitimacy in offer - rejected. ','Sumatidevi M. Dhanwatay Vs Union Of India And Ors JUDGMENT\n\n2004(3) SCR 928\n\nThe following Judgment of the Court was delivered\n\nThe appellant travelled by 1st Class Air conditioned berth from Nagpur to\nBombay by Howrah-Bombay Mail. She was carrying her luggage which included\ngold, pearl, silver and diamond jewellery and other valuables valued at Rs.\n1,11,756. While she was travelling, she was assaulted by some unauthorised\npassengers and her gold, silver, pearl, diamond and other valuables were\ntaken away forcibly. This incident occurred on 4.12.1991. Thousands of\npersons entered into the compartment and assaulted the passengers,\nincluding the appellant. The said crowd was so violent that they broke the\ndoors, window bars, glass panels, seating berths and toilets etc. This\napart, the crowd committed so many other illegal acts of assaulting the\nbonafide passengers. They molested the women and even raped the young girl\npassengers. The appellant pulled the alarm chain three times, as a result\nof which, the train stopped at Igatpuri Station. She, alongwith other\nbonafide passengers got down at that station. She approached the Railway\nAuthorities for protection, but, without any assistance. On reaching\nBombay, she lodged a complaint with the police about the incident. The\nappellant approached the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission,\nMaharashtra State (hereinafter referred to as &apos;the State Commission&apos;, for\nshort) by filing a complaint claiming compensation of Rs. 9,32,256. The\nState Commission, after considering the material that was placed before it\nand on considering the rival contentions, allowed the claim of the\nappellant partly awarding total compensation of Rs. 1,41,756. The Railway\nadministration, aggrieved by and not satisfied with the said order, filed\nan appeal before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission\n(hereinafter referred to as &apos;the National Commission&apos;, for short). The\nNational Commission, by the order under challenge in this appeal, set aside\nthe order made by the State Commission. Hence this appeal.\n\nThe learned counsel for the appellant strongly contended that the National\nCommission was not right and justified on facts as well as in law in\nupsetting the order passed by the State Commission; the National Commission\nhas set aside the order made by the State Commission without dislodging the\nreasons given by the State Commission in allowing the claim made by the\nappellant; the National Commission has set aside the order of the State\nCommission simply stating that the State Commission was not right in\nupholding that there has been a deficiency in service on the part of the\nRailway administration. The learned counsel added that having regard to the\nfacts found, the State Commission was fully justified in ordering the\ncompensation.\n\nIn opposition, the learned counsel for the respondent Nos. 1 to 4 submitted\nthat the order impugned in this appeal is just and supportable order.\nAccording to her, the State Commission had no jurisdiction to entertain the\ncomplaint made by the appellant; there was no deficiency in service on the\npart of the Railway administration; when an unruly mob entered into the\nrailway compartment and caused damage on the person and property of the\npassengers, the Railway administration was helpless. In such a situation,\nno complaint could be entertained by the State Commission under the\nConsumer Protection Act, 1986.\n\nWe have considered the respective submissions made on behalf of the\nparties. As is evident from the order of the State Commission that opposite\nparties Nos 1, 3, 5 &amp; 6, i.e., Union of India, Chief Security\nCommissioner, Secretary, Home Department and Inspector General of Police,\nremained absent. No written version was filed by any of the parties on the\ndate given. The complaint was posted for final hearing on 14.9.1993, on\nwhich date the Union of India and the General Manager, Central Railway\nfiled written version jointly. The averment made in the complaint that the\nappellant travelled by train on that day when the incident happened, is\nadmitted. However, the Railway administration denied its responsibility as\nto the theft of luggage of the appellant and the injuries suffered by her.\nThe only contention of the Railway administration was that it was not\nresponsible for the toss of luggage and injuries caused to the appellant.\nThe State Commission, on consideration of the facts and circumstances, has\nrecorded that having regard to the past experience, the Railway\nadministration did not take reasonable steps to avoid such incident. It is\nalso recorded in the order of the State Commission that the allegations of\ninjuries suffered by the appellant and the loss caused to her luggage, the\nRailway administration had not been able to controvert effectively. It was\nsubmitted on behalf of the Railway administration before the State\nCommission that the claim as to the loss of ornaments urged by the\nappellant, was exaggerated. As&apos; regards loss of the Bank Draft, it was\ncontended that intimation could be given to the concerned Bank. An argument\nwas also advanced that the complaint was not maintainable under the\nprovisions of  Consumer Act- safety- Compansation- The appellant travelled by 1st Class Air conditioned berth from Nagpur to Bombay by Howrah-Bombay Mail- she was assaulted by some unauthorised passengers and her gold, silver, pearl, diamond and other valuables were taken away forcibly- They molested the women and even raped the young girl passengers. The appellant pulled the alarm chain three times, as a result of which, the train stopped at Igatpuri Station-She, alongwith other bonafide passengers got down at that station. She approached the Railway Authorities for protection, but, without any assistance- she lodged a complaint with the police about the incident. The appellant approached the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Maharashtra State by filing a complaint claiming compensation of Rs. 9,32,256- The State Commission, after considering the material that was placed before it and on considering the rival contentions, allowed the claim of the appellant partly awarding total compensation of Rs. 1,41,756- The Railway administration, aggrieved by and not satisfied with the said order, filed an appeal before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (hereinafter referred to as \'the National Commission\', for short). The National Commission, by the order under challenge in this appeal, set aside the order made by the State Commission. Hence this appeal-under Section 124A of the Railways Act, 1989, the Railway administration cannot escape the liability having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case and in the light of the incident that had taken place. As to the deficiency of service on the part of the Railway administration, no such plea was raised before the State Commission. The Railway administration also did not raise any issue as to the maintainability of the complaint or jurisdiction of the State Commission to deal with the complaint. Even otherwise, under Section 3 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, the complaint could be entertained by the State Commission in the absence of any such plea taken by the Railway administration as to the jurisdiction to entertain the complaint. This being the position, in our view, the impugned order passed by the National Commission cannot be sustained. No good reason was given by the National Commission to upset the order passed by the State Commission, as already observed. Under the circumstances, the appeal is entitled to succeed.
