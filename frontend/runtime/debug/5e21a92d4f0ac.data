MOHAPATRA,J This appeal, filed by accused no.1 Babu Kuttan Ramkrishna Pillai and accused no.2 Umesh @ Babu Purshottam Bhatt of TADA ACT Spl.Case No.33 of 1994, is directed against the judgment and order dated 21.8.1998 of the Designated Court at Brihan `Mumbai under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 (for short TADA Act). In the said case seven accused persons faced trial under Section 120-B read with 307 r/w 34, 307 r/w 114, 307 r/w 149, 387 r/w 34, 143, 144, 147, 148 and 506 (ii), 353 r/w 114 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 3(2)(ii), 3(3), 3(5), 5 and 6 of the TADA Act and section r/w 25(IB)\r\n\r\n(a), Section 5 r/w 27 of the Arms Act. The gist of the prosecution case relevant for the purpose of this proceeding may be stated thus: With the growth of industry, commerce and trade in and around the city of Mumbai which generates substantial quantity of wealth, there has been increase of organised activities by gangs of anti-socials to extract money from affluent sections of society like developers, hoteliers and other businessmen by putting them in fear of death and then to demand substantial sums of money commonly known as &quot;Khadani&quot; i.e. protection money. One such gang was operating in the city under Amar Naik @ Bhai, who died a couple of years before the decision in the case at an encounter with the police. The prosecution alleged that in pursuance of a criminal conspiracy between 15.1.1994 to 16.5.1994 the accused persons and others of the gang embarked upon preparatory acts like procuring the information about the names of the builders of M/s Kalpataru Construction Company which was engaged in developing a property at Pali Hill, named Nakshatra Building. PW-7 Sudhir Tambe was the Senior Vice-President of the company with its head office at Nariman Point. He used to sit in the head- office. PW 6 Pachapur, Civil Engineer, was an employee of the company who used to remain at the site to supervise the construction. As the prosecution story runs, on 15.4.1994 between 11.30 a.m. and 12.00 noon while PW 6 was on duty at the construction site, accused no.3, Nitin Vasant Venugurlekar armed with revolver and accused No.4 Rajindera @ Rajan Mahadeo Margaj armed with a chopper and accused no.5 Jayendra @ Jai Anandrao Jadhav also armed with a chopper visited the site of Nakshatra Building; they threatened the workers at the site, forcibly brought PW 6 Pachapur in a room on the ground floor and man-handled him. Accused no.3, pointing a revolver at him demanded the name, address and telephone number of the builders. PW 6 disclosed the name of PW 7 Tambe and gave his telephone number to them. The accused then asked him to go to the office of the builders at Nariman Point and make the arrangement for a telephonic talk with Tambe. PW 6 rushed to the office and told Tambe of what had happened at the construction site. This was followed by telephonic calls from the accused who wanted to speak to Tambe. Attempts were made by PW 6 and PW 7 to avoid any discussion with the gangsters. Two or three days thereafter when the accused got Tambe on the telephone he (Tambe) gave them some other telephone numbers and asked them to contact those persons including one D.N.Ghosh, the Security Contractor. Eight/ten days thereafter again a telephone call was made to the office of Tambe which was received by PW 6 who was informed by the person making the call that they could not get D. N. Ghosh on the telephone numbers furnished by Tambe. Thereafter PW 6 handed over the receiver to Tambe. This incident was followed by several threats given by the gangsters to workers and also repeated telephone calls made to the Head Office of the company to contact Tambe. The staff of the site office absented from work resulting in virtual closure of construction activity. On 11.5.1994 the deceased Sanjay Patil telephoned to Tambe and warned him that he is wasting time and should meet him without further delay. After some days there was one more similar call from Sanjay Patil and he asked Tambe that he should talk to Bhai and saying so he handed over the receiver to another person who gave his identity as Amar Naik (since deceased), who told Tambe that he should pay Rs.10 lacs. The later pleaded his inability to pay such a heavy sum and after some discussion agreed to pay Rs.5 lacs. He was asked to come to Nakshatra Building site on 16.5.1994 along with money. In the meantime Tambe informed all the happenings to the Addl. Commissioner of Police Mr.Sanjeev Dayal and the then Dy. Commissioner of Police of Zone VII Mr. Rajanish Sheth within whose jurisdiction Khar Police Station fell.\r\n\r\nOn 16.5.1994 at about 12.00 noon the deceased Sanjay Patil telephoned Tambe and inquired from him as to what he was going to do about the payment and then Tambe replied that he will be leaving office at about 2.00 p.m. for Pali Hill. Sanjay Patil cautioned him that he should not make any haste and he should wait for his call so that he will take necessary instructions from his boss i.e. Amar Naik. At about 2.00 p.m. on that day there was a telephone call from Sanjay Patil telling that Tambe should not meet him at the Nakshatra Building site but instead he should meet him near the Ceaser Palace Hotel. This telephonic conversation was tape-recorded. Tambe was instructed on telephone that his man shall carry a white plastic bag containing the amount of Rs.5 lacs and shall wait near the entrance gate of Ceaser\r\n Indian Penal Code Section 120-B r/w 307, 34 likewise 307, r/w 114, 149 and 387 r/w 34, 143, 144, 147, 148 and 506(ii), 353 r/w 114 - Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 `TADA Act&#39; 25(IB)(a) - the Arms Act Section 5, 27 - Indian Penal Code, Section 120-B and 395 considered as saw - charged sentenced detainment for a long time - We do not find that the appreciation of evidence made by the learned trial Judge suffers from any illegality nor can findings recorded by him be said to be perverse- Appeal rejected.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n Appeal Dismissed','Jullundur Improvement Trust Vs Mohan Singh (Dead) By L.Rs. And Ors ORDER\r\n\r\n1. The respondents are the legal representatives of the deceased respondent..\r\n\r\n2. The Jullundur Improvement Trust was established and constituted under the Punjab Town Improvement Trust, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Improvement Trust&quot;). One of the duties and functions assigned to the trust is to frame development schemes for benefit of public. The improvement trust framed scheme known as &quot;development scheme&quot; for providing land to public within the municipal limits of Jullundur city. On 4.1.1970, the Trust resolved that the employees and trustees of the Jullundur Improvement Trust shall be granted residential accommodation on &quot;no profit no loss&quot; basis under the aforesaid scheme. It is not disputed that the plaintiff-respondent herein was one of the trustees of the improvement trust. On 22.1.1971, the plaintiff-respondent submitted an application for allotment of residential plot. While the said application was pending, the government 6y order dated 27.1.1971, directed that no trustee shall be allotted any plot of land in the development scheme formulated by the Improvement Trust at a reserved price. Despite that order of the state government, the trust by resolution dated 24.2.1971, resolved to allot a residential plot to the plaintiff-respondent subject to the approval of the state government. On 31.8.1971, a provisional letter of allotment of land was issued to the plaintiff-respondent. In pursuance thereof, it is alleged that the respondent deposited the price of the land. When the aforesaid fact came to the notice of the government, the government by letter dated 5.9.1972 called upon the improvement trust to show cause under what circumstances, the provisional allotment has been made in favour of the plaintiff-respondent. It is not disputed that the said scheme was subsequently not approved by the state government and it fell through. Under these circumstances, the plaintiff-respondent filed a suit for permanent injunction restraining the appellant herein from committing the breach of the alleged agreement and from cancelling the provisional allotment made i\r\n Trust and Societies - Contract - Specific help - Injunction - Improvement trust confined advancement conspire for giving area to open inside the civil furthest reaches of city - Employees and trustees to get convenience on no benefit no misfortune&quot; premise under the plan - Despite request of the state government that no trustee should be allocated any plot of land at a saved value, a determination gone by trust in which the offended party respondent partook and got a distribution of land - Scheme is no longer a subsisting plan as not endorsed by state Govt. - No closing contract has appeared between the litigant trust and the respondent - Relief of changeless directive looked for in the suit couldn&#39;t have been allowed by the trial court and insisted by the High Court - Sections 38, 39 and 41 of Specific Relief Act, 1963.\r\n Appeal Dismissed With Cost','Dasrath vs State Of M.P on 29 July, 2010 V.S. SIRPURKAR, J.\r\n\r\n1. The present appeal is directed against the judgment of the High Court dismissing the appeal of the appellant Dasrath. He was convicted by the Trial Court of the offence under Section 304B,&nbsp;Indian Penal Code&nbsp;(IPC) and was sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and pay a fine of Rs. 5,000/- and in default directed to suffer further imprisonment for one year. He was also convicted for the offence under&nbsp;Section 201,&nbsp;IPC&nbsp;and was directed to suffer rigorous imprisonment for one&nbsp;year with a fine of Rs.1,000/- and in default to suffer three month&#39;s further imprisonment.\r\n\r\n2. Initially, as many as three accused persons came to be tried by the Sessions Judge, they being accused No.1, Kalyan, accused No.2, Dasrath and accused No.3, Smt. Usha. While accused No.2, Dasrath is the present appellant, accused No.1, Kalyan Singh and accused No.3, Smt. Usha are his father and sister, respectively. The Trial Court had also convicted Kalyan Singh for the same offence. However, it acquitted accused No.3, Smt. Usha from all the charges. Both the accused had filed an appeal challenging their conviction and the sentences before the High Court. However, during the pendency of the appeal, accused No.1 Kalyan Singh expired and his appeal, thus, abated. The appeal of Dasrath, the present appellant came to be dismissed by the High Court and that is how he is before us.\r\n\r\n3. Shortly stated, the prosecution story was that Dasrath was married to Pinki who died under suspicious circumstance of burning. An intimation regarding death came to be given to the Police Station Pandhokhar, Distt. Gwalior. The said intimation was given by the complainant Vadehi Saran s/o Ramanand Kaurav who was none else but the father of the deceased Pinki. It was, inter alia, stated that on that day i.e. 12.8.1992 in the morning his son Jitendra Singh had gone to village Saujna for Rakhi&nbsp;festival to his daughter Pinki&#39;s house. But he returned at about 7 p.m. and told him that Pinki had caught fire and was sent to Daboh for treatment. Vadehi Saran further stated that on hearing the news, he along with some co-villagers went to Daboh. However, one Santosh belonging to his village met him near Dugdha Dairy and told him that Pinki had died. Then Vadehi Saran along with others went to village Saujna. But by the time they reached there, Pinki&#39;s cremation was over. It was because of this that they came to the Police Station and further action was requested on the basis of the death report.\r\n\r\n4. On this basis, a First Information Report was got registered on 16.8.92 wherein it was recorded that the death intimation was given on 12.8.92 at 23.15 hours orally about the death of Pinki. It was recorded on a preliminary inquiry made by Head Constable Jaswir Singh by visiting village Saujna and the Station House Officer R.S. Purohit had also made inquiries relating to the death. The place of occurrence was examined by SDOP R.K. Hirodia and inquiry was made from the deceased&#39;s father Vadehi Saran, uncle Uttam Singh, brothers Janved Singh and Jitendra Singh, mother Vidya Devi and sister Pratibha. During this inquiry, it was found that the deceased was married 2 years prior to the date of incident and because of the non-payment of dowry, her husband Dasrath, father-in- law Kalyan Singh and Sister-in-law Usha were harassing her. The earlier&nbsp;statement given by Vadehi Saran was repeated. It was then mentioned that on 12.8.1992 the sister-in-law Usha, husband Dasrath caught hold of Pinki and father-in-law Kalyan Singh poured kerosene oil on her and set her on fire because of which she got burnt. The accused thereafter cremated her and cleaned the place where occurrence had taken place.\r\n\r\n5. On the basis of this, further investigation ensued and after its completion, a charge-sheet came to be filed in the Court for offences under&nbsp;Sections 302,&nbsp;304&nbsp;B and 201&nbsp;IPC. The accused were charged accordingly. The prosecution, during the trial, examined as many as 11 witnesses. The accused persons abjured the guilt and as stated earlier only two of them came to be convicted, namely, Kalyan Singh and Dasrath. However, due to the death of Kalyan Singh during the pendency of the appeal, the appeal filed by Dasrath alone is to be considered.\r\n\r\n6. Learned Senior Counsel, Dr. J.N. Singh appearing on behalf of the accused attacked the judgment of both the Courts below, firstly, contending that conviction under&nbsp;Section 304B,&nbsp;IPC&nbsp;and Section, 201,&nbsp;IPC&nbsp;was wholly incorrect as it was not proved that Pinki had died a suspicious or un-natural death within the seven years of her marriage nor was her body found. He also contended that there was no question of demanding any dowry as no complaint was ever made for dowry nor was there any evidence regarding the demands of dowry. Lastly, he suggested that there&nbsp;was no question of any offence having been committed. He pointed out that the Trial Court had acquitted all the accused of the offence under&nbsp;Section 302,&nbsp;IPC&nbsp;though a charge was also framed under that Section and there was no appeal by the State Government against the acquittal under&nbsp;Section 302,&nbsp;IPC. Under such circumstances, it was clear that the accused persons could not be held responsible for the death of Pinki.\r\n\r\n7. As against this, Ms. Aishwarya Bhati, Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent pointed out that it could not be said that the death did not take place within seven years of marriage as the accused himself had admitted that the marriage had taken place six years prior to the trial. She further pointed out that there was a clear assertion made by the witnesses in their evidence. More particularly, Vadehi Saran (PW 4), Janved Singh (PW-5), Pratibha (PW-6) and Jitendra Singh (PW-8) had clearly asserted that the dowry was asked for by the accused persons. Learned Counsel further contended that if Pinki had died of burning, a report ought to have been made for un-natural death which the accused did not bother to make, instead they had cremated the body of Pinki without even intimating the relatives of the deceased and also without waiting for the police. This was the most suspicious circumstance which pointed towards the guilt of the accused.\r\n\r\n8. It is on the basis of these rival versions that it is to be seen as to whether the appellant Dasrath was rightly convicted for the offence.\r\n\r\n9. The first contention raised by the Learned Counsel for the defence regarding the corpus delicti not being found was countered by Ms. Bhati by saying that there can be no dispute about the death of Pinki. It is not the defence of the accused that Pinki was still living. On the other hand, the accused persons admittedly had cremated her body on the fateful day. Therefore, this is not a case, according to her, of corpus delicti not being found and, therefore, there being a serious suspicion about the death having taken place at all. The question is, in the absence of corpus delicti, could it be presumed that the accused persons alone were responsible for the death of Pinki. We must hasten to add here that the accused persons have already been acquitted of the murder charge. What remains to be seen is as to whether Pinki died an un-natural death within seven years of her marriage and whether her death was attributable to the demand of dowry and further whether she was dealt with cruelly soon before her death. If these ingredients are proved by the prosecution then the conviction of the accused under&nbsp;Section 304B,&nbsp;IPC&nbsp;will be complete.\r\n\r\n10. There can be no dispute that Pinki had died an un-natural death. In fact there is enough evidence to suggest that Pinki suffered the burn injuries. It is not the defence of the accused that she died a natural death.&nbsp;Both the Courts have very specifically held that Pinki suffered burn injuries and died because of the same. In fact Jitendra Singh (PW-8) was specific in his evidence that Pinki was burning on account of the kerosene having been poured on her body. In fact it is apparent from his cross-examination that when Pinki shouted, neighbours rushed to her house. There can be no dispute that this witness has been dis-believed and rightly so, insofar as his evidence about the accused deliberately burning Pinki is concerned. However, there can be no dispute that Pinki was burnt and it was clear that she had died an un-natural death. Again, it is clear from the report of the chemical analyzer that the kerosene residues were found from Packet-A which contained the clothes of Pinki which were seized during the investigation. Therefore, it is clear that Pinki&#39;s death was caused because of the burns and not in the normal circumstances. The finding of the Trial Court and the appellate Court in that behalf is correct. For this reason we are not impressed by the argument of the Learned Counsel that in the absence of corpus delicti, the conviction could not stand. Similarly, there can be no dispute that Pinki died within seven years of her marriage. Gandharv Singh (PW-1) had specifically asserted that the marriage was performed 3-4 years prior to the incident. Though this witness was declared hostile, at least the fact that marriage had taken place 3-4 years prior to the incident can be safely accepted. According to PW-2, Bhagwati Saran also the marriage had taken place within 5-6 years prior to trial.&nbsp;Again even this witness was declared hostile. However, that claim remained un-controverted. Third witness PW-3, Hari Saran asserted that the marriage was performed 6-7 years earlier to the date of his evidence. His evidence was in May, 1997 and even taking that the marriage took place somewhere in the year 1990, it would still be within seven years. Vadehi Saran, the father also said that the marriage had taken place 6-7 years prior to the date of his evidence which was again 30.09.1997. Therefore, according to his evidence even if the marriage could date back to the year 1987, it would still put the death of Pinki within seven years of her marriage.\r\n\r\n11. Therefore, it is certain that Pinki died an un-natural death by burning within seven years of her marriage. As regards dowry, Learned Counsel for the defence pointed out that there was no specific evidence nor was any allegation made in the First Information Report. We are not much impressed as we have seen from the evidence that there were demands of Buffalo made to Vadehi Saran, father of Pinki who did not accept that demand. Vadehi Saran has also specifically stated in his evidence that after 1 = years of the marriage when he went to the house of Pinki in the month of Shravan, door was closed and the appellants were beating Pinki and that the floor was smeared with blood and blood was also oozing out from the mouth of Pinki. He also asserted about the demand of a large&nbsp;size television as the television which was given in marriage was a small colour television. This evidence of torture is well supported by the evidence of Pratibha (PW-6), Anant Ram Singh (PW-7) and Uttam Singh (PW-9). In view of this, the Trial court and the appellate Court have recorded that, firstly, Pinki died an un-natural death because of burning within seven years of her marriage and, secondly concluded that she was subjected to cruelty and harassment by her husband and/or relatives in connection with the demand for dowry and that she was subjected to cruelty soon before her death.\r\n\r\n12. Similar is the case as regards the offence under&nbsp;Section 201,&nbsp;IPC. In fact it was incumbent upon the accused persons to firstly, inform the police about the un-natural death of Pinki. They did not do so. On the other hand, even after her death, they did not inform either the police or even the relatives like her father etc., though they could have done so. In stead they hurriedly conducted the funeral thereby causing destruction of evidence.\r\n\r\n13.&nbsp;In State of Rajasthan v. Jaggu Ram&nbsp;[2008 (12) SCC 51], this Court has considered the circumstance about the non-information to the parents and the hurried cremation. This was also a case where accused persons were tried for offence under&nbsp;Section 304B,&nbsp;IPC, where the accused, after the death of the unfortunate lady did not bother to inform her parents. In&nbsp;paragraph 26, this Court took a serious note of the manner in which the body was disposed of. The Court observed &quot;the disposal of the dead body in a hush-hush manner clearly establishes that the accused had done so with the sole object of concealing the real cause of death of Shanti @ Gokul.&quot;\r\n\r\n14. In that case, the funeral was conducted in the wee hours. In this case, funeral was conducted in the evening.\r\n\r\n15. From all this, it is clear that the prosecution has not only proved the offence under&nbsp;Section 304B,&nbsp;IPC&nbsp;with the aid of&nbsp;Section 113B,&nbsp;Indian Evidence Act&nbsp;but also the offence under&nbsp;Section 201,&nbsp;IPC.

We have gone through the judgments of the Trial Court as well as the appellate Court carefully and we find that both the Courts have fully considered all the aspects of this matter. We, therefore, find nothing wrong with the judgments and confirm the same. The appeal is, therefore, dismissed.\r\n\r\n.......................................J.\r\n\r\n(V.S.

Officers J U D G M E N T ARUN KUMAR, J.\r\n\r\nThe forest service in the State of Orissa was constituted under the&nbsp;Indian Forest Act, 1927 and the Madras Forest Act, 1882. However, in 1972 the State had its own&nbsp;Forest Act. The primary object of the legislation was protection and management of forests in the State. The words &#39;forest officer&#39; have been defined under the Act to mean persons whom the State Government, or any officer empowered by it in this behalf, may appoint to carry out all or any of the purposes of the Act. A forest officer would include the Principal Chief Conservator of Forest as well as subordinates like Conservator of Forests, Forest Range Officers, Deputy Rangers and Foresters. In the year 1979 the State of Orissa adopted the Antyodaya Programme of the Central Government. Under the said programme Social Forestry Projects were undertaken which envisaged contact with the poorest of poor farmers to educate and train them in matters connected with farming. For purpose of the Social Forestry Projects, ex cadre posts of Forestry Extension Officers (for short &#39;FEOs&#39;) were created by the State Government. These were project related posts and their expenses were met from special funds raised for the project. The project was for specific purpose and for a specific period and was funded by the Central Government. The duration of the project was, however, extended from time to time in order to fulfil its objective.\r\n\r\nThe recruitment for the posts of FEOs was to be made from the open market. The officers were to be given training in raising of seedlings, nursery work etc. so that when they go to the field they could properly motivate and educate the farmers. The minimum qualification prescribed for FEOs was Intermediate with Botany as a subject. After recruitment these officers were to be posted in blocks wherein forestry extension work was undertaken. Certain blocks within the State were selected for such extension work as a part of the Forestry Extension Programme. The FEOs were envisaged as somebody remaining in touch with small farmers at the lowest level in each village block and assessing their requirements of forest species and other species. The respondents were recruited as Forestry Extension Officers under the Project from 1979 onwards. The respondents claim that they should be treated as part of the forest service under the Forest Department of the State Government and the posts held by them should have equal pay and equal status with the equal level posts in the Forest Department. They further claim that the posts held by them should be included in the channel of promotion to higher posts in the forest Department. The grievance of the respondents is that they have been stagnating in the posts of FEOs to which they were recruited nearly twenty years ago. According to them though the project has senior level posts of Social Forestry Supervisors but these posts are being filled by getting officers from forest service of the State Government on deputation, thereby the posts are being denied to them. In the matter of pay scales the grievance of the FEOs is that they are being equated with foresters who are neither as qualified as they are nor the foresters discharge such important functions as they are discharging. The minimum educational qualification prescribed for the post of forester in the quota meant for direct recruits at the relevant time was Matriculation only. The FEOs are trained to motivate people under Social Forestry Projects which requires contact with individual farmers and working at the grass root level. On the other hand, officers of the Forest Department of the State are mainly concerned with protecting forests, including forest property, preventing illegal felling of trees, keeping a check on forest contractors in order to ensure that forest produce is not illegally exploited and removed, prevention of poaching of forest animals etc..\r\n\r\nIn the year 1990, some of the Forest Extension Officers (FEOs) approached the Orrisa Administrative Tribunal for purposes of relief with regard to the above demands. In fact, before approaching the Tribunal they had made representation to the Government which did not yield any result. This Original Application was disposed of by the Orissa Administrative Tribunal vide order dated 7.9.1995. The Tribunal noted that the government was alive to the grievance being aired by the FEOs. It directed the State Government to decide the question of fixation of pay scales of FEOs within six months. The Association of the FEOs was allowed an opportunity to be heard by the officers of the State Government who would be taking such a decision on behalf of the government. The Tribunal further observed that when the question of pay scales would be considered, the question of promotional avenues should also be taken into consideration. It appears that nothing happened in pursuance of the said direction of the Tribunal. The Association of FEOs again approached the Tribunal by way of an application in the year 1996. The main grievance of the Association was that inspite of the FEOs being well qualified, they were being made to stagnate as there were no chances of promotion to higher posts available for them. The other grievance was about not getting appropriate scale of pay. The respondents claim that they should be treated as equivalent to Forest Rangers and the scale of pay and service benefits given to Forest Rangers should be available to them also.\r\n\r\nThe Tribunal noted that the nature of duties performed by FEOs and the Foresters could not be compared because the two were entirely different. Similarly, the method of recruitment and the basic qualifications required for eligibility to the two posts were different. However, the grievance of the FEOs could not be overlooked. Undoubtedly, the FEOs were not getting any chances of promotion nor they were getting the pay scales commensurate to the duties and functions being performed by them. Having regard to these aspects the Tribunal directed that those FEOs who have put in more than ten years of service as FEOs should be treated at par with the post of Deputy Ranger in the state forest service and placed in the same scale of pay which is now applicable to Deputy Rangers. They should also be made eligible for promotion to the posts of Forest Rangers. Those FEOs who have put in less than ten years of service may be treated at par with Foresters and be made eligible for promotion as Deputy Rangers. The Tribunal noted that it was stated in the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the Government in the proceedings before the Tribunal that steps were being taken for movement of the FEOs to other divisions so as to induct them into the mainstream. The Tribunal expected that this movement should start which would result in FEOs with more than ten years of service being posted as Deputy Rangers when they are moved from Social Forestry Section and others should be posted as Foresters. In view of the averments in the counter affidavit the Tribunal recommended to the State Government that the exercise in terms of the above directions should start without further delay so as to equip the FEOs for their induction into the mainstream whenever the Social Forestry Welfare Scheme is abolished. The order of the Tribunal also contained a direction that in future vacancies for Forest Rangers and Deputy Rangers quotas should be earmarked for FEOs with more than ten years of service and FEOs with less than ten years of service respectively. The Tribunal directed the State Government to complete the exercise within four weeks.\r\n\r\nThe State Government issued an order on 19th May, 1998 carrying out the directions contained in the aforesaid judgment of the Orissa Administrative Tribunal. Those Forest Extension Officers who had put in more than ten years of service were to be treated at par with Deputy Rangers and placed in the same pay scale i.e. 1200-30-1560-EB-40-2040. Since out of 105 Forestry Extension Officers, 100 had already completed more than ten years of service as FEOs they were to be declared Senior Grade Forestry Extension Officers and were to be made eligible for promotion to the post of Forest Ranger. Those FEOs who had rendered less than ten years of service were to be treated at par with Foresters. The order contained further details about how the various quotas were to be worked out and postings were to be made.\r\n\r\nOne of the Foresters, under an apprehension that FEOs belonging to the Social Forestry Projects were being merged with the mainstream forest service of the State, approached the State Administrative Tribunal in the year 1998 seeking a declaration that Forestry Extension Officer do not belong to the cadre of the state forest service and that they should not be promoted to the posts of Deputy Rangers. The case of the applicant before the Tribunal was that the Social Forestry Project was a project scheme and the FEOs appointed under that scheme held ex-cadre posts. They were appointed to execute the Project and, therefore, they had nothing to do with regular forest service under the State Government. Since they were holding ex-cadre posts they could not claim promotion to the posts under the cadre. The Tribunal in its order dated 27th January, 1999 found that the apprehension of the petitioner before it was totally misplaced. The Forestry Extension Officers were being given only the pay scales of the equivalent posts in the State Government. Giving equivalent pay scales did not mean that they were being merged with the forest service of the State Government. Similarly regarding their promotions to the posts of Senior Social Forestry Extension Officer, their identity was being kept separate. The equivalence was provided only qua the scales of pay. The Tribunal noted:\r\n\r\n&quot;6. There is nothing in the letter of 19th May, 1998 to show that at any point of time the posts of Social Forestry Extension Officers or Senior Grade Social Forestry Extension Officers on one side and the Deputy Rangers and Foresters on the other have been made interchangeable posts. In order to give incentive to the Extension Officers only a separate channel of promotion has been creatd for them. Neither an Extension Officer can claim a post of Deputy Ranger nor a Forester can claim the post of Senior Grade Forestry Extension Officer.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe Tribunal further observed:\r\n\r\n&quot;7. However, in sub-para (i) of paragraph 1 of the said letter there is an observation that the forestry Extension Officer with more than 10 years of service should be posted as Deputy Ranger when it is proposed to move them out of the Social Forestry Directorate and others having less than ten years of service may be posted as Foresters. We are of the vie that since the government do not intend to make the posts interchangeable, this observation cannot be accepted as reasonable. Until the Extension Officers and Senior Extension Officers are regularly absorbed in the cadre of Foresters and Deputy Rangers and Rangers, they cannot be allowed to hold the posts of Ranger/Deputy Ranger or Forester. We, therefore, advise the State Government to frame a scheme or rules for their absorption in the Forest Department in the event of the abolition of the Directorate of Social Forestry. Until then, the Extension Officers shall not be brought over to the cadre of Foresters and Deputy Rangers. In case the Government desire that the Senior Grade Forest Extension Officer should also have further promotional facility, it is open to the State Government to consider and create appropriate promotional posts for them.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe above order was passed on 27th January, 1999. The State Government filed a Special Leave Petition in this Court challenging the earlier order of the Tribunal dated 5th March, 1997 in the first week of November, 2000 without even making a reference to the subsequent order dated 27th January, 1999. Thus the order dated 27th January, 1999 has not been challenged by any party. Leave to appeal was granted in the Special Leave Petition and the matter was registered as Civil Appeal No.1079 of 2001 which is being disposed of by this order.\r\n\r\nDuring the pendency of this Civil Appeal the Government of Orrisa passed a resolution dated 8th August, 2003 re-organising the field establishments of the Forest and Environment Department under the &#39;Forestry and Wildlife&#39; wing by abolishing the Afforestation and Social Forestry Division and Circles and creating a number of Territorial and Wildlife Divisions and Circles. Further the resolution abolishes certain establishments including the Social Forestry Department. The staff of the Departments which were being abolished was deployed within the remaining establishments. The said resolution provides that the Government had decided to abolish eighteen establishments under the control of Director, Social Forestry Project with which we are concerned in the present case. With the abolition of eighteen establishments of Social Forestry Project, the staff of the establishments is to be deployed in the Divisions/Circles/State Forest Headquarters as per the plan given in the resolution. The resolution came into effect on the date it was issued i.e. 8th August, 2003 and provides that the reorganization exercise was to be completed by 30th September, 2003. The exercise had started and in pursuance thereof a Memo dated 24.10.2003 was issued. None of the parties appearing before us have disputed the said resolution. In fact, an affidavit was filed in the present proceedings on behalf of the respondent Association bringing the said resolution on record. The respondents further stated that in view of the resolution dated 8th August, 2003 the points sought to be raised by the Government in the present appeal were no longer available to it. By the said resolution the members of the respondent-association i.e. Forest Extension Officers (FEOs) who were working under the Social Forestry Projects had been taken into the mainstream i.e. into the Forest Department of the Government of Orissa called the Territorial and Wildlife Division. The Social Forestry Directorate stands abolished. It is a resolution of the State Government. Naturally the learned counsel for the appellant, i.e. the State of Orissa accepts the resolution. In view of these developments the FEOs have ceased to be officers working against a particular project. They have become part of the forest service of the State Government. Their grievances do not survive any more. We have also heard the learned counsel appearing for some of the forest service officers who had intervened in these proceedings. He has tried to canvas that the position of his clients should not be adversely affected due to the merger. As at present he could not spell out any cause for worry for his clients. In any case, in the event of any prejudice being caused to the interveners, they will have independent cause of action for which they are free to pursue their remedies. So far as the State Government is concerned, it is bound by its resolution and, in fact, has taken steps to implement the same. Nothing survives in this appeal. The same is accordingly dismissed as having become infructuous.

The Commissioner of Gift Tax, Kerala, has appealed to this Court. Held: Court is unable to agree with the views so expressed. The donor is exempt under s. 5 (1) (xiv) from liability to pay tax only if the gift is in the course of carrying on a business, pro fession or vocation and is made bona fide for the purpose of such business, profession or vocation. The clause does not enact that a gift made by a person carrying on any business is exempt from tax, nor does it provide that a gift is exempt from tax merely because the property is used for the purpose for which it was used by the donor. Without deciding whether the test of commercial expediency&quot; is strictly appropriate to the claim 3 76 for exemption under S. 5 ( 1 ) (xiv), we are of the view that there is no evidence on the record to prove that the gift to Thomas was &quot;in the course of carrying on the business&quot; of the donor, and &quot;for the purpose of the business&quot;. The appeal is allowed and the order passed by the High Court is set aside. The Commissioner of Gift Tax will get his costs in this Court and the High Court.

The accused persons are the father and brother respectively of the deceased. The incident purportedly took place on 3.1.1990. Though the prosecution relied on the evidence of many persons who supposedly witnessed the occurrence, while deposing in Court, most of them resiled from the statements made during investigation. The version projected by the prosecution was that the deceased was throttled and also poison was administered to him. But the report of the Forensic Science Laboratory stated that the viscera did not contain any poison. The prosecution, therefore, gave up its stand that the deceased was administered poison by the accused persons. There were purportedly some extra-judicial confessions on which the Trial Court relied. Accordingly, the accused persons were convicted for offences punishable under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short &#39;IPC&#39;).

Subhashini for the Respondents.\n     The Judgment of the Court was delivered by\n     RANGANATHAN, J.  The seeds	 of the	 present controversy\nwere sown  as early  as in 1946. It is unfortunate that this\nmatter should  be  coming  up  before  this  Court  for	 its\nconsideration nearly  five decades  later, though it must be\npointed out  that the  issue in	 its  present  form  is	 the\noutcome of an amendment made by the Finance (No.2) Act, 1980\n(hereinafter referred  to as  &apos;the 1980	 Act&apos;) to the Income\nTax Act,  1961* (hereinafter referred to as &apos;the 1961 Act&apos;).\nIt is also a curious co-incidence that the 1980 Act effected\ntwo amendments in the 1961 Act with retrospective effect and\nthe validity  of both  these provisions have been challenged\nbefore the courts. The first was the controversy with regard\nto the	retrospective amendment	 of s.80-J which was settled\nby this	 Court by its decision in Lohia Machines Limited  v.\nUnion of India, (1985) 152 I.T.R. 308 (SC). It is the second\namendment to  the provisions  contained in  section 35(2) of\nthe 1961  Act that has given rise to the present controversy\nbetween the parties.\n     The question  is really  one of  interpretation of	 two\nimportant provisions relating to the computation of business\nincome for  purposes of	 income tax.  We may  start with the\nprovisions of  the Indian  lncome Tax Act, 1922 (hereinafter\nreferred to  as the &apos;1922 Act&apos;). The computation of business\nincome for  purposes of	 income tax  was done  in accordance\nwith the  provisions of	 section 10  of the said Act. In the\nprocess of making such computation, the Act provided for two\nimportant deductions  (among  others),	in  respect  of	 the\ncapital assets	employed in  the business. The first was the\ndeduction under clause (vi) of Section 10(2) of an allowance\nin respect of the depreciation of building, machinery, plant\nor furniture being the property of the assessee and used for\nthe purposes  of the business, at a prescribed percentage of\nthe written  down value	 of such  assets. This	allowance is\ncalculated, in	respect of  the year  of acquisition  of the\nproperty, at a percentage of its actual cost to the assessee\nand in subsequent years at a graduated scale on the basis of\nthe actual  cost less the depreciation allowances granted in\nthe preceding years. In strict principle, this is an\nallowance of  capital nature but it is now well settled that\nthe allowance  of depreciation	has to be taken into account\nin order  to ascertain	the true  profits of a business and,\ntherefore, an  assessee	 is  permitted	to  deduct,  in	 the\ncomputation of	the business  income year  after  year,	 the\nprescribed percentage  of the  value of	 the assets used for\nthe purposes of business. The second allowance was not there\nin the 1922 Act originally and was introduced by the Income-\ntax (Amendment)	 Act, 1946.  The introduction was of certain\nallowances  in	 respect  of   expenditure  on.	 \"scientific\nresearch related  to the  business\", an expression which was\ndefined in  a fairly  comprehensive manner  by the  statute.\nThree types  of allowances were permitted in respect of this\ncategory of  expenditure of which we are here concerned with\nonly one.  This provision  was contained  in clause (xiv) of\nS.10(2) which permitted a deduction.\n     \"in respect of any expenditure of a\n     capital   nature	 on   scientific\n     research related  to the  business,\n     an allowance  for each  of the Five\n     consecutive     previous	   year.\n     beginning	 with the  year in which\n     the expenditure  was  incurred,  or\n     where the	expenditure was incurred\n     prior to  the commencement	 of  the\n     business,	for  each  of  the  five\n     consecutive     previous	   years\n     beginning with  the year  in  which\n     the business  was commenced,  equal\n     2to one-fifth of such expenditure:\n     Provided that no allowance shall be\n     made for  any expenditure	incurred\n     more than	three years  before  the\n     commencement of the business:\n     A Provided further that-\n      XXX   XXX	    XXX\n     (d) where	a deduction  is	 allowed\n     for any  previous year  under  this\n     clause in	respect	 of  expenditure\n     represented wholly or partly by any\n     asset,  no	  deduction   shall   be\n     allowed under clause (vi) or clause\n     (vii) for the same previous year in\n     respect of that asset;\n     (e) where	an asset  is used in the\n     business after it ceases to be used\n     for scientific  research related to\n     that business,  and a  claim for an\n     allowance	under	clause	(vi)  or\n     clause (vii)  is made in respect of\n     that asset,  the actual cost to the\n     assessee  of  the	asset  shall  be\n     treated as reduced by the amount of\n     any deductions  allowed under  this\n     clause;\"\n     A cursory	and conjoint  reading of  section 10(2) (vi)\nand section  10(2) (xiv)  suggests that	 where	an  assessee\nincurs	expenditure   of  a  capital  nature  on  scientific\nresearch related to the business and the expenditure results\nin the	acquisition of	an asset,  the assessee	 can  claim,\nunder clause  (vi), a  deduction of the specified percentage\nof the	written down  value of	the asset   and under clause\n(xiv) he can ask for a deduction, in five consecutive years,\nof the expenditure he has incurred on the acquisition of the\nasset. For  this purpose, we are assuming that an asset used\nfor scientific research related to the business is also ipso\nfacto an  asset used  for the purpose of business. There has\nbeen some  debate before  us as to whether this is always so\nbut we need not enter into that controversy for the purposes\nof the present case.\n     It will  at once  be seen that, if these two provisions\nare applied   simultaneously, it would result in granting an\nassessee  a   double  allowance	  in  respect  of  the	same\nexpenditure -  one of  the entire amount over a period	of 5\nyears and  the other  a percentage of the expenditure over a\nnumber .  consecutive years  at a  graded scale	 as  already\nmentioned. The	question at  once leaps	 to the	 mind as  to\nwhether it  could have been the intention of the legislature\nto  permit   both  these  deductions  simultaneously  to  an\nassessee. The  provisions of  clauses (d)  and	(e)  of	 the\nproviso to  S.10(2) (xiv)  contain a  clue  to	answer	this\nquestion. More about it later.\n     We next  turn to  the provisions of 1961 Act. The topic\nof depreciation	 is dealt  with by section 32. Section 32(1)\n(ii) provides for depreciation. As under the 1922 Act, it is\nallowed at a percentage of the written down value of certain\ncapital assets	employed in  the  bussiness.  The  topic  of\nscientific research expenditure is dealt with by section 35.\nSection 35(1)  provides for  the deduction  of four types of\nexpenditure on	scientific	research  and  what  we	 are\nconcerned with is the deduction provided under section 35(1)\n(iv), which is to the following effect:\n     (iv) in  respect of any expenditure\n     of a  capital nature  on scientific\n     research related  to  the	business\n     carried on	 by the	 assessee,  such\n     deduction	as   may  be  admissible\n     under  the	    provisions	of  sub-\n     section (2).\"\n     Sub-section (2)  provides that,  for  the	purposes  of\nclause (iv)of  sub-section (1),	 one-fifth  of	the  capital\nexpenditure incurred  in any previous year shall be deducted\nfor that  previous year;  and the balance of the expenditure\nshall be  deducted in  equal instalments in each of the four\nimmediately  succeeding	  previous  years.   There   is	  an\nexplanation which  is not relevant for our present purposes.\nReading S.35(2) further, it provides in clauses (iv) and (v)\nas follows:\n     \"(iv) where  a deduction is allowed\n     for any  previous year  under  this\n     section in	 respect of  expenditure\n     represented wholly	 or partly by an\n     asset,  no	  deduction   shall   be\n     allowed under clauses (i), (ii) and\n     (iii) of sub-section (1) of section\n     32 for  the same  previous year  in\n     respect of that asset;\n     (v) where	the asset  mentioned  in\n     clause (ii) is used in the business\n     after it  ceases  to  be  used  for\n     scientific research related to that\n     business,	depreciation   shall  be\n     admissible under  clauses (i), (ii)\n     and  (iii)	  of  sub-section(1)  of\n     section 32.\"\nReference must	also be made to Explanation 1 to s. 43(1) in\nthis context. It read as follows at the relevant time:\n     \"Explanation:  Where  an  asset  is\n     used in business after it ceases to\n     be	 used  for  scientific	research\n     related  to  that	business  and  a\n     deduction	has  to	 be  made  under\n     clause (i),  clause (ii)  or clause\n     (iii) of  sub-section (I)	or  sub-\n     section  (1A)   of	 section  32  in\n     respect of	 that asset,  the actual\n     cost of  the asset to the assessee,\n     as reduced	 by the	 amount	 of  any\n     deduction allowed under clause (iv)\n     of sub-section (1) of section 35 or\n     under any	corresponding  provision\n     of the  Indian Income-tax Act, 1922\n     (11 of 1922).\"\n     From the  above it	 will be seen that the provisions of\nSection 32(1)  (ii) and	 Section 35(2) (i) (iv) and (v) read\nwith  Explanation   1  to   s.43(1)  virtually	 repeat	 the\nprovisions contained in Section 10(2) (vi) and 10(2)(xiv) of\nthe 1922  Act, so  that the  question  earlier	posed  still\nloomed in the  background of 1961 Act.\n     In 1968  there was	 an amendment  in the  provisions of\nSection 35(2).	The  sub-section  was  amended	to  read  as\nfollows:\n     \"(2) For  the  purposes  of  clause\n     (iv) of sub-section (1),-\n     (i) in  a case  where such	 capital\n     expenditure is  incurred before the\n     1st day  of April,	 1967, one-fifth\n     of the capital expenditure incurred\n     in	 any   previous	 year  shall  be\n     deducted for  that	 previous  year;\n     and the  balance of the expenditure\n     shall   be	   deducted   in   equal\n     instalments for  each of  the  four\n     immediately   succeeding	previous\n     years;\n     (i-a) in  a case where such capital\n     expenditure is  incurred after  the\n     31st day  of March, 1967, the whole\n     of	  such	  capital    expenditure\n     incurred in any previous year shall\n     be	 deducted   for	 that	previous\n     year.\"\n     The effect	 of this amendment was only to provided that\nthe  entire   amount  of  capital  expenditure	incurred  in\nrelation to  scientific research  was allowed as a deduction\nin one	year instead  of being	spread over a period of five\nyears as  was the  position earlier. This amendment does not\ntouch the   controversy	 in issue  before us  and it  has no\nsolution to offer to our present difficulty.\n     The provisions  of Section	 10(2) (vi) and (xiv) of the\nold Act	 had been administered between 1946 and 1962 and the\nprovisions of  Section 32  and 35  of the 1961 Act have been\nadministered since  1962. The  question	 whether an assessee\ncan  simultaneously  claim  an	allowance  or  deduction  in\nrespect of  the same  expenditure once	under Section 32 and\nagain in   Section 35 must have cropped up in some cases and\ndoes appear that such a double claim was put forward in some\ncases. The  contention on  behalf of  the assessees was that\nthe allowances	in respect  of depreciation  on the one hand\nand in respect of capital expenditure on scientific research\non the other are two totally different and independent heads\nof allowances.	 one  is a notional allowance to provide for\nthe wear  and tear  of	a  capital  asset  employed  in	 the\nbusiness as the years roll by; the other is an allowance for\nactual expenditure  of a  capital nature granted, on the eve\nof our	country&apos;s independence,	 in order  to give fillip to\nnew industrial innovations and the development of indigenous\nknow-how and  techniques by  proper planning on research and\ndevelopment by	various business  houses. It  is   therefore\nsuggested that	there is  nothing absurd  in construing	 the\nstatutes act  as providing  cumulatively for  both types  of\ndeductions in  respect of  the same  capital asset. The only\nlimitations on	this right are the two placed by the statute\nitself. The first limitation, contained in clause (d) of the\nproviso to  Section 10(2)  (xiv) and  s.35(2) (iv)  is	that\nboth the deductions cannot be claimed \"for the same previous\nyear\" in  respect of  the same	capital	 asset.	 The  second\nlimitation is found in clause (e) of the proviso  to Section\n10(2) (xiv)  and s.35(2)  (v) which  say that  if a  capital\nasset used  for scientific research ceases to be so used but\nis thereafter  brought into a  business for use therein, the\nactual cost for purposes of granting depreciation in respect\nof the asset thereafter should be taken as the amount of its\noriginal cost  reduced by  the amount  of deductions allowed\nunder Section  10(2) (xiv)  or s.35(2).	 In other words, the\ncontention of the assessee was and is that both the types of\nallowances are	permissible under  the statute except to the\nextent limited	by clauses  (d) and  (e) of  the proviso  to\nSection 10(2)  (xiv) of	 the  1922  Act	 and  reproduced  in\nclauses (iv) and (v) of	 Section 35(2) of the 1961 Act.\n     Before us	it is claimed on behalf of the assessee that\nthis interpretation  of the  statutory	provisions  is	very\nclear, patent  and unambiguous.	 It is	alleged that despite\nthis, some Income-tax Officers started disallowing the claim\nof depreciation	 in respect  of such  capital assets even in\nprevious years	during which  no deduction  was	 claimed  or\nallowed under Section 10(2) (xiv) or Section 35(2), contrary\nto the	clear language	of clause  (d) of  s.10(2) (xiv) and\ns.35(2) (iv). These Of orders were reversed on appeal either\nby the	Appellate Commissioner	or by  the Tribunal.  It was\nsuggested that	these decisions	 were almost  unanimously in\nfavour of  the assessee	 but the   department  persisted  in\npursuing the  matter upto  the stage of the High Court. Only\none reference  on this	topic came up before the High Courts\nand is	reflected in  the decision  of	the  Karnataka	High\nCourt, reported	 as CIT v. Indian Telephone Industries Ltd.,\n(1980) 126 I.T.R. 528. This was a reference of the year 1977\nmade at	 the instance  of the Commissioner of Income Tax and\nthe Commissioner of Income Tax lost this reference. The High\n(Sourt	re-affirmed   the  position  contended	for  by	 the\nassessee as  the one and only possible interpretation of the\nstatutory provisions. It is, therefore, contended that there\nwas, and  could have  been, no	doubt that  an assessee	 was\nentitled to  claim depreciation allowance in respect of such\nassets in  respect of  previous years  other than  those  in\nwhich an  allowance   had been allowed under the other head.\nWe shall revert later to this aspect of the matter.\n     At this stage, the Finance (No.2) Act, 1980 intervened.\nIt amended section 35(2) (iv) to read as follows:\n     \"(iv) where  a deduction is allowed\n     for any  previous year  under  this\n     section in	 respect of  expenditure\n     represented wholly	 or partly by an\n     asset,  no	  deduction   shall   be\n     allowed   under clauses  (i),  (ii)\n     and (iii)	of  sub-section	 (1)  of\n     section 32	 for  the  same	 or  any\n     other previous  year in  respect of\n     that asset.\"\n		      (Emphasis added)\n     The  Finance  Act	made  this  amendment  retrospective\nw.e.f. 1.4.62,	that is, the date of the commencement of the\n1961 Act.  This amendment is undoubtedly far-reaching in its\neffect.	 It   will  result  in	completion  of	the  pending\nassessments of	several years  on the  footing	of  the	 new\nprovision. It  will also involve re-opening or rectification\nof completed  assessments of  earlier years,  to the  extent\npermissible under the provisions of sections 148 and 154, in\ncases where  assessees had  been granted  \"double allowance\"\naccepting their	 contention at	the  time  of  the  original\nassessments. The  effect will be not for one assessment year\nbut for a number of assessment years in succession. Painting\na very	grim picture  of the  consequences  of	giving	full\nretrospective effect  to the  amendment, the  assessees	 say\nthat it will impose unexpected and impossible burden on them\nover the  years. jeopardise their solvency and lay them open\nto action  by creditor	and financial  institutions. Such an\nonerous burden, it is said. is unreasonable\nand  oppressive	 and  the  provision  imposing	such  burden\nviolates the  fundamental  rights  of  the  assessees  under\nArticles 14  and 19(1)	(g) of the Constitution of India. It\nis on  this plea  that, even  though assessments and appeals\nare pending in several of these cases, the petitioners chose\nto approach  this Court	 by  way  of  writ  petitions  under\nArticle 32  of	the  Constitution.  These  are	mostly	writ\npetitions of the year 1981 and are now coming up for hearing\nafter a period of 10 years.\n     Learned counsel  for the  assessees do  not contest the\ncompetence  of	 the  legislature   to	enact  the  impugned\nprovision, nor	do they dispute the right of the legislature\nto give	 retrospective effect  to statutory  provisions. The\ncontention only	 is that  retrospective	 provisions  may  be\npermissible   even in  taxing statutes	in  certain  special\ncircumstances such  as in  the case of provisions clarifying\nthe  impact   of  a  statute,  provisions  curing  defective\nlegislations in	 the light of the judicial decisions and the\nlike. They,  however, say that if the legislature chooses to\nimpose a  totally new  burden,	which  was  not	 at  all  in\ncontemplation	earlier	   and	 proceeds   to	 give	full\nretrospective effect  thereto, such  an	 attempt  should  be\nstruck	down   as    unreasonable  and	discriminatory.	 The\nprincipal questions, therefore, for our consideration are:\n     1)	 Were	the  earlier   statutory\n     provisions capable	 of  only    one\n     interpretation, namely, that placed\n     by the  assessees or  was there any\n     ambiguity in relation thereto ?\n     (2) If  there  was	 some  doubt  or\n     ambiguity	 about	  the	 earlier\n     legislation,  and	 the  1980   Act\n     clarified	 the   position	  by   a\n     retrospective amendment,  would  it\n     offend  the   provisions	of   the\n     Constitution ?\n     (3) If,  on  the  other  hand,  the\n     earlier provision	was  very  clear\n     and    capable    of    only    one\n     interpretation, as	 placed	 by  the\n     assessee,	 was   the   legislature\n     within its	 rights in  amending the\n     provision	retrospectively	  w.e.f.\n     1.4.62   and   thus   imposing   an\n     unreasonable  tax	 burden	 on  the\n     assessees?\n     Taking up	the first  of the three questions, it has to\nbe considered  from two	 angles, one  factual and the other,\nlegal. An  attempt was	made on behalf of the petitioners to\nproject an  image as  if the  interpretation  sought  to  be\nplaced by  the department on pre-1980 provisions to disallow\ndepreciation on such assets was so far-fetched that it never\nreceived the  approval of  the higher appellate authorities.\nIt was	suggested that	the appeals by assessees against the\ndisallowance invariably	 succeeded and it was the Department\nthat had  to move  the High Court on reference, the first of\nwhich references came up before the Karnataka High Court in\nC.l.T. v.  Indian Telephone  Industries	 (1980)	 126  I.T.R.\n548 and was answered against the Department. On the basis of\nsuch allegations  the petitioners attempted to make out that\nthe Department&apos;s  interpretation was  patently untenable and\nthat the  1980 amendment is not in the nature of a statutory\nclarification of  an ambiguity	but a  totally new and fresh\nimposition sought  to be  unjustifiably given  retrospective\neffect.\n     But, as Shri B.B. Ahuja has pointed out on the basis of\nthe averments  of the  petitioner in one of the cases, viz.,\nW.P.1153/81, the  impression sought  to be  created  by	 the\npetitioners does  not accord  with the	correct	 facts.	 The\nposition in  the case  is available  only as it stood at the\ntime when  the writ  petition and the counter affidavit were\nfiled	and   subsequent   developments	  are	not   known.\nNevertheless, the  picture that	 emerges is  this.  In	that\ncase, the  Income-tax  Officer	(I.T.O.)  is  said  to	have\nallowed depreciation on assets used for scientific research,\nfor the	 assessment year  1969-70, though  this is denied by\nthe department.	 The claim  was perhaps	 disallowed  by	 the\nI.T.O. for the assessment year 1970-71, but it was allowed\nby the	Allahabad Bench of the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal\n(I.T.A.T.) by  its order  dated 30.8.76.  For the assessment\nyear 1971-72,  the I.T.O.  disallowed the  depreciation. The\nAppellate Assistant  Commissioner (A.A.C.)  allowed it.	 The\ndepartment appealed to the Delhi Bench of the I.T.A.T. which\naccepted the department&apos;s plea by its order dated 13.8.79\n placing  reliance on the decision of a Special Bench of the\nI.T.A.T. It  has been  stated that  the	 assessee  filed  an\napplication for	 reference  to	the  High  Court  which	 was\npending when the writ petition was filed. For the assessment\nyears 1972-73  to 1974-75,  the assessments are pending as a\nstay order  had been  obtained for  reasons  which  are	 not\nknown. For  the assessment  years 1975-76  and 1976-77,	 the\nassessee claimed  depreciation	on  a  number  of  items  of\nscientific research  assets. The I.T.O. \"allowed\" the claims\nsubject to  the rider  that \"there  is no  provision to give\ndeduction of  more than	 100% of  the expenditure  by way of\ndepreciation\". The  assessee  appealed	to  Commissioner  of\nIncome-tax (Appeals)  who disallowed the claim. For 1977-78,\nthe l.T.O. disallowed the claim and the C.l.T. dismissed the\nassessee&apos;s appeals. For assessment years 1978-79 to 1980-81,\nthe assessments	 are stated  to be  pending. The above facts\nare sufficient to show that, atleast after 1.4.1968, - there\nis no  information before  us as  to  the  position  between\n1.4.1946 and  31.3.1968 -  the Department  has been  putting\nforward its  objections on  the issue  and that the same was\nthe subject  matter  of	 controversy  at  various  appellate\nstages, some  decided in  favour of,  and some	against, the\nassessee. A Special Bench of the l.T.A.T. had indeed decided\nthe issue  against the	assessee. In  this background, it is\nnot correct  to say  that the position was crystal clear and\nthat, save  for a  few ITOs  who took  a biassed  view,	 the\nauthorities were  all agreed that the Department&apos;s stand was\nuntenable. Some	 of the	 reported decisions  also show	that\nthere was  a live  controversy and that references have been\nmade to	 the  High  Court  both	 at  the  instances  or	 the\nassessees [see	Alkali &amp;  Chemical Corporation of India Ltd.\nv. C.l.T. (1986) 161 I.T.R. 820 (Cal.), and C.I.T. v. Indian\nExplosives Ltd.,  (1992) 192  I.T.R. 144 (Cal.)], as well as\nat the instance of the Revenue [see, C.I.T. v. International\nInstruments P. Ltd., (1983) 144 I.T.R. 936 (Kar.); C.I.T. v.\nMahindra Sintered Products Ltd. (1986) 161 I.T.R. 692 (Bom.)\nand Warner  Hindustan Ltd.  v. CIT,  (1988) 171	 I.T.R.	 224\n(A.P.)]. The petitioner&apos;s contention that, under the\n pre-amended  provisions, depreciation	on such	 assets	 was\nrecognised  allround   as  clearly  allowable  is  therefore\nrejected. We  have dealt  with this  aspect only  to meet an\naspect that  was urged. What is really important is the true\nand correct  interpretation of	those provisions,  not	what\nsomeone thought	 of it	then and to this aspect we shall now\nturn.\n \n     The second	 aspect of  the First of the three questions\nposed  earlier	 for  our  consideration  is  the  legal  or\ninterpretational aspect	 of the	 provisions  as	 they  stood\nprior to  the 1980  Amendment. Under  the provisions  of the\nstatute as  they stood	earlier, could	the  assessees	have\nclaimed continued  grant of depreciation after the expiry of\nfive previous  years before the 1968 amendment and after the\nexpiry or  the first  year after  the 1968  amendment,	even\nthough the  entire cost of the capital asset in question had\nbeen allowed  to  be  written  off  completely	against	 the\nbusiness  profits  of  those  five  previous  years  or	 one\nprevious year  as the  case may	 be? We	 think the answer to\nthis question  must emphatically  be in the negative. In our\nview, it is impossible to conceive of the legislature having\nenvisaged  a   double  deduction  in  respect  of  the	same\nexpenditure, even  though it  is true  that the two heads of\ndeduction do  not  completely  overlap	and  there  is	some\ndifference in  the rationale  of the  two  deductions  under\nconsideration. On behalf of the assessees reliance is placed\non the	following circumstances to support a contention that\nthe statute  did not  intend one  deduction to	preclude the\nother :\n     (i) lt  is pointed	 out that  s.10(2) (xiv) of the 1922\nAct, was  inserted in  1946 consequent on the insertion of a\ncorresponding  provision   in  the   United  Kingdom.	That\nprovision, viz. s.20(4) of the U.K. Finance Act, 1944\n read thus :\n     (4) Where	a deduction  is	 allowed\n     for any  year under  this	 or  the\n     last preceding  section in	 respect\n     of expenditure   represented wholly\n     or	 partly	  by  any   assets,   no\n     deduction	 shall be  allowed under\n     any provisions  of	 the  Income-tax\n     Act other	than this  part of  this\n     Act in  respect of	 wear and  tear,\n     obsolescence,    depreciation    or\n     exceptional depreciation  of  these\n     assets for	 any year  of assessment\n     during any	 part of  which they are\n     used by  the person carrying on the\n     trade   for   scientific	research\n     related to the trade. \"\n	  (emphasis supplied)\n     The Indian provision, it is said, has made a deliberate\ndeparture from	the said  provision and	 limited the  bar of\ndepreciation only  to those  previous years  during which  a\ndeduction is allowed under S.10(2) (xiv);\n     (ii) When	the Income-tax	Bill,  1961  was  under	 the\nconsideration of  the  Law  Commission,	 the  provisions  of\nS.10(2) (vi)  and (xiv) were carefully reviewed. But changes\nwere made  and the  provisions of the new Act in this regard\nwere drafted in pari materia with those of the old Act ;\n     (iii) The language used in clause (d) of the proviso to\nS.10(2)	 (xiv)	and  S.35(2)  (iv)  again  is  significantly\ndifferent from the language used in various other provisions\nof the	Act which,  in	like  contexts	of  possible  double\nallowances, emphatically  rule out  deductions in respect of\nthe same expense or exemptions in respect of the same income\nunder two  different provisions	 for the  same or  even	 any\nother assessment  year :  See, for  example, Sections  20(2)\n35B(2), 35C(2), 35CC(4), 35CCA(3), 35CCB(3), 35D(b), 35E(8),\n80GGA(4), 80HH(9A), 80HHA(7) and 80HHB(S); and\n     (iv) When the relevant provisions say that depreciation\nshall not be allowed in certain previous years, it permits a\ndisallowance only  in those  previous years  and  means,    The seeds of the present controversy were sown as early as in 1946. It is unfortunate that this matter should be coming up before this Court for its consideration nearly five decades later, though it must be pointed out that the issue in its present form is the outcome of an amendment made by the Finance (No.2) Act, 1980 (hereinafter referred to as \'the 1980 Act\') to the Income Tax Act, 1961* (hereinafter referred to as \'the 1961 Act\'). It is also a curious co-incidence that the 1980 Act effected two amendments in the 1961 Act with retrospective effect and the validity of both these provisions have been challenged before the courts. The first was the controversy with regard to the retrospective amendment of s.80-J which was settled by this Court by its decision in Lohia Machines Limited v. Union of India, (1985) 152 I.T.R. 308 (SC). It is the second amendment to the provisions contained in section 35(2) of the 1961 Act that has given rise to the present controversy between the parties.\r\n\r\nheld: So far as the arguments of taking away of vested rights is concerned, it is evident from the facts stated in the writ petition 1153/81 - which was treated as representative of the facts and contentions in all the writ petitions and with reference to which facts were arguments addressed itself that none of the assessments relating to any of the assessment years concerned herein has become final. They are pending at one or the other stage and in one or the other forum. I need not dilate upon this aspect inasmuch as the impugned amendment merely makes explicit what was implicit in the unamended clause, as explained hereinabove. In such a situation, the argument of any right vesting in the assessees is misplaced.\r\n\r\nThe writ petitions accordingly fail and are dismissed. No costs.\r\n\r\nPetitions  was dismissed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ','Sachalmal Parasram Vs Ratnabai And Ors. JUDGMENT S.M. Sikri, C.J.\r\n\r\n1. This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh dismissing the appeal filed by the appellant before us. The relevant facts for the determination of the points raised before us are as follows :\r\n\r\n2. Respondents Nos. 1, 2 and 3, who were the owners of the premises in dispute, mortgaged the premises in favour of respondent No. 4, with possession. Vide two mortgage deeds dated December 5, 1947 and October 26, 1948, for the amounts of 12,000/-and Rs. 4,000/- respectively. The date of payment was October 8, 1952, but by a subsequent agreement dated November 18, 1952, this was extended. The agreement further provided as follows :\r\n\r\nThe portion of the house in your side shall remain with you at a rental of Rs. 50/- per month. It was with you previously at Rs. 43/- per month. We shall not be responsible for any decrease or increase in the rental thereof. You shall have the right to let out the half portion of the shop on your side to any person at full rent\r\n\r\nOn May 1, 1958 respondent No. 4, the mortgagee in possession, filed a suit for foreclosure. During the pendency of this suit he let out the premises to the appellant at Rs. 55/- per month. It was provided in the rent agreement between the mortgagee and the appellant that &quot;incase the owner of the house gets the house released from mortgage under us, then I shall get the house vacated for you and hand it over to you.&quot; On September 28, 1960, a compromised decree for redemption was passed. The mortgagors, in execution of the said compromise decree, sought to take possession of the premises in dispute, which had been rented to the appellant. The appellant&#39;s objections under Order 21 Rule 97, CPC, were ultimately disallowed by the High Court, in revision, on April 18, 1964. The appellant then filed the present suit under Order 21, Rule 103, CPC for a declaration that &quot;the plaintiff (appellant) being the tenant of defendants Nos. 1, 2 and 3 (respondents) cannot be evicted unless eviction proceedings are taken against him under M.P. Premises Control Act.&quot; In the alternative, the appellant prayed for a declaration that &quot;if the plaintiff is considered to be the tenant of deft No. 4 even after the redemption decree the plaintiff cannot be evicted. He also prayed for a consequential permanent injunction. The Trial Court dismissed the suit. An appeal before the Additional District Judge also failed. As already mentioned, the second appeal before the High Court also failed.\r\n\r\n3. The learned Counsel for the appellant submitted that respondent No. 4, being the mortgagee in possession, had the right to let the premises in dispute both under Section 76 of the Transfer of Property Act, and under the agreement dated November 18, 1952. According to him, this act was an act prudent management and was binding on the respondents Nos. 1, 2 and 3. He further contended that he was protected by the provisions of the Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Control Act, 1961, and could not be evicted except in accordance with the provisions of that Act.\r\n\r\n4. The points raised by Mr. Naunit Lal are concluded by the decision of this Court in All India Film Corporation Ltd. v. Sri Rajagyan Nath : , which decision was unfortunately not brought to our notice during the course of the hearing. In this case the facts were similar. A mortgagee in possession had let out the premises, which was a cinema house, and the lessee had further sublet the same, to sub-les Sections On redemption the purchaser\r\n Property - Mortgage - Section 76(a) of Transfer of Property Act, 1882 - High Court expelled Appeal documented by Appellant for assertion that Plaintiff being an occupant can not be removed unless ousting procedures are taken against him and furthermore petitioned God for significant lasting directive - Hence, this Appeal - Whether, demonstration of rent was not demonstration of judicious administration - Held, long rent on such little lease was not demonstration of reasonability - However, Section 76(a) of Act expressed that demonstrations done genuine and wisely in common course of administration bound even after end of title of mortgagee under lock and key - Moreover, lease deed itself stipulated that renter would empty house and hand over same to Respondent on the off chance that proprietor of House got house discharged from home loan - There was no landowner and no inhabitant - Therefore arrangements of Rent Restriction Act couldn&#39;t matter - Appeal rejected.\r\n Disposed off','Hira Lal Rattan Lal Etc.

They  raise\ncommon questions of law for decision, and they are  directed\nagainst a common judgment of the Allahabad High Court.\nThe  facts  of the case lie within a  narrow  compass.	 The\nappellants  are dealers in foodgrains including cereals	 and\npulses	especially  split or processed foodgrains  and	dal.\nThe dispute in this case centers round the question  whether\nthe  Government	 is  competent	to  levy  sales-tax  on	 the\npurchases   made  by  the  appellants  of  split   processed\nfoodgrains  and	 dal  under the	 provisions  of	 the  United\nProvinces  Sales  Tax  Act, 1948 as  amended  by  the  Uttar\nPradesh	 Sales Tax Act (Amendment and Validation) Act,	1970\n(which will hereinafter be referred to as the Act).\nUnder  the Sales Tax Act as it originally stood	 which	will\n-hereinafter  be  referred  to as the  principal  Act),	 the\npurchases  of  split  or processed  foodgrains	and  dal  by\ndealers	 were sought, to be brought to tax under s.  3-D  of\nthe  principal Act read with the notification  issued.	 The\nvalidity  of the levy was challenged by Tilock Chand  Prasan\nKumar,	the appellant in Civil Appeal NO&apos;. 1625 of  1971  in\nrespect	 of  the assessment made on him for  the  assessment\nyear  1966-67  by assessment order dated June  30,  1968  by\nmeans of a writ petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution.\nThe  High  Court of Allahabad struck down the  levy  holding\nthat the dal purchased by the petitioner before it could not\nbe  said  to be a commodity essentially different  from	 the\narhar  dal  purchased by the dal mills and  accordingly	 the\npurchases effected by the petitioner could not be  regarded\nas  the first purchases.  This decision is reported  in	 25,\nS.T.C.	p. 118.	 Thereafter the Governor of U.P.  issued  an\nordinance  known as Uttar Pradesh Sales Tax  (Amendment	 and\nValidation) Ordinance, 1970 (U.P. Ordinance\n \nNo. 2 of 1970) adding inter alia Explanation 11 to s. 3-D as\nwell as s. 7 to the principal Act.  This ordinance was later\non  enacted  as	 an  Act  to  which  we	 have  already	made\nreference.  The provisions of the Amending Act are identical\nwith the provisions in the Ordinance.  Though at the time of\nthe  institution  of  the writ petitions  from	which  these\nappeals arise, the Ordinance had not yet been made into	 the\nAct, the Amending Act came into force during the pendency of\nthe writ petitions.  Hence we shall refer to the  provisions\nof the Amending Act.\n	      Under the principal Act a dealer is defined in\n	      s.  2(c)	as \" \"dealer\" means  any  person  or\n	      association   of	persons	 carrying   on	 the\n	      business	of buying or selling goods in  Uttar\n	      Pradesh, whether for commission,	remuneration\n	      or  otherwise, and includes any firm or  Hindu\n	      Joint   Family  and  any	society,   club	  or\n	      association  which sells goods to its  members\n	      and also includes any department of the  State\n	      Government  or  the Central  Government  which\n	      carries  on such business and any	 undertaking\n	      engaged  in the generation or distribution  of\n	      electrical energy or any other form of power.\"\n	      (Explanation  to the section is  not  relevant\n	      for our present purpose).\n	      Section 3 of the Act provides for the levy  of\n	      multi-point tax.	The portion of that  section\n	      which  is	 material for  our  present  purpose\n	      reads :\n	      \"Subject to the provisions of this Act,  every\n	      dealer shall, for each assessment year, pay a\n	      lax at the rate of two naye paise per rupee on\n	      his  turnover  of such year,  which  shall  be\n	      determined   in	such  manner   as   may	  be\n	      prescribed\"\n	      Section  3-A  provides  for  a  single   point\n	      taxation in respect of sale of certain  goods.\n	      At  present we are only concerned with  s.  3-\n	      D(1).  It provides :\n	      \"Except as provided in sub-section (2),  there\n	      shall be levied and paid, for each  assessment\n	      year  or part thereof, a tax on the  turnover,\n	      to  be  determined in such manner	 as  may  be\n	      prescribed,  of  first  purchases	 made  by  a\n	      dealer  or  through  a  dealer,  acting  as  a\n	      purchasing  agent in respect of such goods  or\n	      class  of	 goods,	 and  at  such	rates,	 not\n	      exceeding	 two paise per rupee in the case  of\n	      foodgrains, including cereals and pulses,	 and\n	      five  paise  per rupee in the  case  of  other\n	      goods and with effect from such date, as	may,\n	      from  time to time, be notified by the,  State\n	      Government in this behalf.\"\n	      (Explanation 1 to this section is not relevant\n	      for our purpose).\n \nThe notification issued under s. 3-D of the principal Act on\nOctober	 1,  1964 (Notification No. S. T.  7122/X)  provided\nthat  with  effect  from October 1, 1964,  the	turnover  of\npurchases  in  respect of goods mentioned therein  shall  be\nliable to tax under s. 3-D at the rate mentioned:\n\"Foodgrains    1.5 paise per rupee on first purchase\nOn  the	 basis	of s. 3-D read	with  the  notification,  as\nmentioned  earlier, the authorities under the Act sought  to\nbring to tax under the principal Act the first purchases  of\nprocessed  or split foodgrains including dal on	 the  ground\nthat  they constituted a separate item of  foodgrains  quite\nindependent  of the unprocessed or unsplit foodgains.	This\nview, as seen above, was negatived by the High Court.  After\nthe  decision  of  the High Court,  the	 principal  Act	 was\namended.   Under  the.	Amending Act  one  more	 Explanation\nviz., Explanation 11 was added to s. 3-D.\n	      \"For  the purposes of this sub-section,  split\n	      or  processed foodgrains, such as in the	form\n	      of  dal shall be deemed to be  different	from\n	      unsplit	or   unprocessed   foodgrains,	 and\n	      accordingly, nothing in this sub-section shall\n	      be  construed to prevent the imposition,	levy\n	      or  collection  of the tax in respect  of	 the\n	      first   purchases	  of  split   or   processed\n	      foodgrains  merely because. tax had  been	 im-\n	      posed  levied or collected earlier in  respect\n	      of the first purchases of those foodgrains  in\n	      their unsplit or unprocessed form.\"\n	      The  Amending  Act  also	added  a  validating\n	      provision to the principal Act viz. s. 7. That\n	      section reads :\n	      \"Notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order\n	      of  any  court or tribunal  to  the  contrary,\n	      every  notification  issued or  purporting  to\n	      have been issued under Section 3-A or  Section\n	      3-D  of  the  principal Act  before  the	com-\n	      mencement of this Act shall be deemed to	have\n	      been  issued under that section as amended  by\n	      this  Act and shall be so interpreted  and  be\n	      deemed to be and always to have been as  valid\n	      as if the provisions of this Act were in force\n	      at   all	material  times;   and	 accordingly\n	      anything	done or any action taken  (including\n	      any order made, proceeding taken, jurisdiction\n	      exercised,  assessment  made, or	tax  levied,\n	      collected or paid purporting to have been done\n	      or   taken   in	pursuance   of	 any	such\n	      notification)  shall  be	deemed	to  be,	 and\n	      always to have been, validly and lawfully done\n	      or taken.\"\n	      It will be necessary later on to consider what\n	      was the vice that the legislature intended  to\n	      cure by the Amending Act.	 The\n	      --L498Sup Cl/73\n \n	      sequence	 of  events  itself  discloses	 the\n	      purpose  of  the	Ordinance  as  well  as	 the\n	      Amending	Act.  That apart, the  statement  of\n	      objects  and  reasons which  can	be  usefully\n	      looked  into  for the purpose of	finding	 the\n	      vice  that  the  legislature  was	 trying	  to\n	      provide against reads thus\n	      \"Sections	 3-A and 3-D of the U.P.  Sales	 Tax\n	      Act,  1948 provide for single point  taxation.\n	      Under the fondler section the tax is levied on\n	      the turnover of sales, while under the  latter\n	      the  tax	is levied on the turnover  of  first\n	      purchases.  Plain and ornamented glass bangles\n	      are subject to tax separately under section 3-\n	      A.   Similarly, unsplit and split	 pulses	 are\n	      separately  subject to tax under section	3-D.\n	      It has been held by the High Court in one case\n	      that tax cannot be levied separately on  plain\n	      and ornamented glass bangles under section 3-A\n	      and  in  another	that tax  cannot  be  levied\n	      separately  on unsplit and split pulses  under\n	      section  3-D  because in their  opinion  plain\n	      glass  bangles are not a	commodity  different\n	      from  ornamented glass bangles  and  similarly\n	      unsplit  pulses and split pulses are also	 not\n	      two  different commodities.   These  judgments\n	      have   created  legal  difficulties   in	 the\n	      assessment  and  collection  of  tax  on	 the\n	      aforesaid	 commodities.  Besides, the  dealers\n	      have  started applying for the refund  of	 tax\n	      already collected on these commodities.	Ibis\n	      will have serious repercussions on the State&apos;s\n	      revenue.	Accordingly, it is proposed to amend\n	      sections	3-A and 3-D to provide for the	levy\n	      of   tax	on  the	 aforesaid  commodities	  as\n	      separate	items.	 It  is	 also  proposed	  to\n	      validate	 the  past  levy,   assessment	 and\n	      collection of tax on the above commodities.\"\n	      (The  remaining  part  of	 the  statement	  of\n	      objects  and reasons is not relevant  for	 our\n	      present purpose).\n	      The  appellants  challenged  the	validity  of\n	      Explanation  11  of  S. 3-D as well  as  s.  7\n	      introduced by the Amending Act before the High\n	      Court of Allahabad in petitions under Art. 226\n	      of  the Constitution.  They further  took	 the\n	      plea that the amendments incorporated were not\n	      effective	 enough	 to bring to tax  the  first\n	      purchases of split or processed foodgrains and\n	      pulses.	 The  High  Court   rejected   these\n	      contentions and dismissed the writ  petitions.\n	      Thereafter  these	 appeals have  been  brought\n	      after  obtaining	certificates from  the	High\n	      Court.\n	      The  validity  of	 the levy  in  question	 was\n	      challenged on the following grounds&apos;:\n	      (1)   That  no fresh levy can be imposed by  a\n	      retrospective legislation;\n \n	      (2)   That  the legislature cannot in case  of\n	      legislation  of the nature with which  we	 are\n	      concerned,    separate	into	 independent\n	      commodities   split  and	unsplit	 pulses	  or\n	      processed	 or unprocessed pulses and  on	that\n	      footing  seek to impose tax twice over on	 the\n	      same commodity in respect of the goods  liable\n	      to be taxed at a single point;\n	      (3)   That  the newly added Explanation to  s.\n	      3-D read with s. 7 of the Amending Act amounts\n	      to an unlawful usurpation of judicial power by\n	      the legislature;\n	      (4)   The newly added Explanation II to s. 3-D\n	      is violative of Art. 14 of the  Constitution\n	      There  is	 no rational  basis  for  separating\n	      split  or	 processed pulses  from	 unsplit  or\n	      unprocessed pulses;\n	      (5)   On a true construction of Explanation It\n	      to s. 3-D no fresh charge can be held to	have\n	      been imposed,\n	      (6)   No	levy  of purchase tax  can  be	made\n	      without a fresh Notification under s. 3-D read\n	      with Explanation 11 showing therein separately\n	      foodgrains  unsplit or unprocessed as well  as\n	      foodgrains split or processed; and\n	      (7)   That   the	 power	conferred   on	 the\n	      Government   under  s.  3-D  amounts   to	  an\n	      excessive delegation of legislative power. and\n	      consequently void.\nThe  source  of	 the  legislative power	 to  levy  sales  or\npurchase  tax  on goods is Entry 54 of the List	 II  of	 the\nConstitution.	 It   is  well	settled	 that	subject	  to\nconstitutional restrictions a power to legislate includes  a\npower to legislate prospectively as well as retrospectively.\nIn this regard legislative power to impose tax also includes\nwithin	itself	the power to  tax  retrospectively--see	 The\nUnion of India v. Madan Gopal Kabra;(1) M. P.  Sundararamier\n&amp;  Co. v. The State of Andhra Pradesh and Anr. (2) ;  J.  K.\nJute Mills Co. Ltd. v. The State of Uttar Pradesh and  Anr.;\n(3) Chhotabhai Jethabhai Patel and Co. v. The Union of India\nand Anr. (4 Sri Ramkrishna &amp; Ors. v. The State of Bihar. (5)\nIn the last mentioned case it was specifically decided	that\nwhere  the legislature can make a valid law, it can  provide\nnot  only  for	the prospective operation  of  the  material\nprovisions  of the said law but it can also provide for	 the\nretrospective operation of the said provisions.\nWe see no force in the second contention advanced on  behalf\nof  the	 appellants.  As seen earlier the  general  rule  as\nenunciated in s. 3 is multi point tax sales tax or  purchase\ntax; but power\n(1) [1954] S. C. R. 541.\n(2)  [1958] S. C. R. 1422.\n(3)  12. S.T.C. 429.\n(4)  [1962] Supp, (2) S.C.R. p. 1.\n(5) [1964] 1 S.C.R. 897.\n \nis conferred on the Government to select any transaction  in\nrespect	 of such goods or class of goods as  the  Government\nmay choose to levy a single point sales tax or purchase tax.\nIt  is open to the legislature to define the nature  of	 the\ngoods,	the sale or purchase of which should be	 brought  to\ntax.   Legislature  was	 not  incompetent  to  separate	 the\nprocessed  or split pulses from the unsplit  or	 unprocessed\npulses and treat the two as separate and independent goods.\nIn  Jagannath and Ors. v. Union of India,(1) question  arose\nfor  decision  whether	it was open to	the  legislature  to\nimpose	separate excise duty on tobacco leaf as well  as  on\nbroken leaf of tobacco.	 This Court overruled the contention\nthat  such a levy was invalid. It head that it was open	 for\nthe legislature to separate the two items.  We see no  basis\nfor  the  contention  that the legislature  cannot  for	 the\npurpose of tax under the Act separate the split or processed\nPulses	from the unsplit or unprocessed.  The power  of	 the\nlegislature  to specify the nature of the goods the sale  or\npurchase of which, it will bring to tax is very wide.\nNow coming to point No. 3, there is no justification for the\ncontention  that  the legislature has usurped  any  judicial\npower.	The legislature has not purported either directly or\nby  necessary implication to overrule the decisions  of	 the\nAllahabad  High.  Court in Tilok Chand Prasan  Kumar&apos;s	case\n(supra).

The contest  before  us  is\nconfined  to the quantum of compensation and, although	Shri\nVasudeva Pillai, counsel for the appellants&apos; has pressed his\npoints	with persistence, we are unable to disturb the	High\nCourt&apos;s award.\nThe land, vast in extent, had a building with a plinth	area\nof  3,300 sq. yds.  The area in which the acquired  plot  is\nsituate	 is  perhaps an important one in  the  City.   After\ngetting	 expert	 valuation  made of  the  buildings  by	 the\nCentral	 Public	 Works Department engineers,  the  Collector\nawarded a sum of Rs. 41,674/- for the buildings, Rs. 1,440/-\nfor the standing trees and a sum of Rs. 30,630/for a belt of\nland  50  ft.  deep  at Rs. 15/- per  square  yard  and	 Rs.\n99,435/-  for  the remaining area of 13,258 sq.	 yds.	The,\ntotal figure together with statutory solarium granted by the\nCollector was Rs. 1,99,155.85. This figure fell far short of\nthe ambitious claim of the appellant and, when the case came\nbefore	the  City Civil Court on a reference, there  was  an\nenhancement   of   compensation.    Although   the   learned\nAdditional Chief Judge held that the area was a little	less\nthan had been determined by the Collector, the market  value\nof the building was increased nearly four fold on the  basis\nof  a multiple of 25 times the rent fetched.  On  the  other\nitems also some changes were made and, consequentially,	 the\ntotal  amount was raised to Rs. 3,31,092/-.   The  appellant\narrived	 in  the High Court asking for more (and  the  State\nalso appears to have appealed, but its appeal was  dismissed\nand we are not therefore concerned with it).\nSome  measure of good fortune attended the appeal since	 the\nHigh Court altered the multiple from 25 to 27 in fixing	 the\ncompensation for the building.	Otherwise, it  substantially\naffirmed the findings of the trial Court, except that to the\nadvantage  of the appellant it restored the  area  acquired.\nThe net result was the appellant obtained a total sum of Rs.\n3,52,326.65 as compensation.\nIt is thus clear that from the Collector to the Civil  Court\nand  on, to the High Court. there has been an escalation  in\nthe  amount  of compensation and, hopefully, the  owner	 has\nreached	 this  Court with his appeal,  under  a	 certificate\nwhich  he  secured under Art. 133(1)(a)	 before	 the  recent\namendment.  We mention this because we are unable to discern\nany  substantial  question of law of general  importance  in\ncounsel&apos;s   submissions	 or  the  points  outlined  in	 the\nmemorandum of appeal which merits the consideration of	this\nCourt.\n \nMerely	because the claim is large the judgment need not  be\nlong  :and,  although  the appellant tried  to	spread	the,\ncanvas	 wide,	 we   regard   the   points   deserving	  of\nconsideration-as  falling  within  a  narrow  compass.	 The\nburden	of  the song has been that Hyderabad has,  for	his-\ntorical	 reasons,  become  a great city and  that  the	land\nacquired has precious potential value which has not  entered\nthe  judicial computation at the lesser levels. (By  way  of\naside  one, may say that society economic development  of  a\nCity-  may  enhance  the  value of  space  without  any	 the\nlittlest contribution by its owner and it is, in one  sense,\nunfair	that  society should pay to an individual  a  higher\nprice  not  because he has-earned it but  because  of  other\ndevelopmental factors.	Of course, we are concerned with the\nLand  Acquisition  Act as it is and this  thought  therefore\nneed not be pursued).  Counsel has also urged that the	land\nand the building taken together had a personality of its own\nand  therefore a special value, missed by the courts  below,\nshould	be ascribed and the methodology of breaking  up	 the\ntotality  into	buildings  and	lands  separately  This appeal, by certificate, arises out of land acquisition proceedings under the Hyderabad Land Acquisition Act (Hyderabad Act IX of 1309 Fasli) (hereinafter called the Act, for short) which substantially resembles the provisions of the Central Land Acquisition Act. The Government of Andhra Pradesh acquired a large open area with some buildings thereon by Notification, dated January 3, 1957 with a view to construct Income-tax add Central Excise Offices at Hyderabad. The contest before us is confined to the quantum of compensation and, although Shri Vasudeva Pillai, counsel for the appellants\' has pressed his points with persistence, we are unable to disturb the High Court\'s award. The land, vast in extent, had a building with a plinth area of 3,300 sq. yds. The area in which the acquired plot is situate is perhaps an important one in the City. After getting expert valuation made of the buildings by the Central Public Works Department engineers, the Collector awarded a sum of Rs. 41,674/- for the buildings, Rs. 1,440/- for the standing trees and a sum of Rs. 30,630/for a belt of land 50 ft. deep at Rs. 15/- per square yard and Rs. 99,435/- for the remaining area of 13,258 sq. yds. The, total figure together with statutory solarium granted by the Collector was Rs. 1,99,155.85. This figure fell far short of the ambitious claim of the appellant and, when the case came before the City Civil Court on a reference, there was an enhancement of compensation. Although the learned Additional Chief Judge held that the area was a little less than had been determined by the Collector, the market value of the building was increased nearly four fold on the basis of a multiple of 25 times the rent fetched. On the other items also some changes were made and, consequentially, the total amount was raised to Rs. 3,31,092/-. The appellant arrived in the High Court asking for more (and the State also appears to have appealed, but its appeal was dismissed and we are not therefore concerned with it). Some measure of good fortune attended the appeal since the High Court altered the multiple from 25 to 27 in fixing the compensation for the building. Otherwise, it substantially affirmed the findings of the trial Court, except that to the advantage of the appellant it restored the area acquired. The net result was the appellant obtained a total sum of Rs. 3,52,326.65 as compensation. It is thus clear that from the Collector to the Civil Court and on, to the High Court. there has been an escalation in the amount of compensation and, hopefully, the owner has reached this Court with his appeal, under a certificate which he secured under Art. 133(1)(a) before the recent amendment. Court mention this because court is unable to discern any substantial question of law of general importance in counsel\'s submissions or the points outlined in the memorandum of appeal which merits the consideration of this Court.\r\n\r\nHeld: Court is satisfied with the valuation of the rented portion of the house adopted by the High Court is correct. Shri Pillai argued in vain for an augmentation of the value on the potential user of the plot for a Cinema House. This story has been factually disbelieved by the Courts below and we cannot reopen the matter. Court must also remember that the Court below has been indulgent enough to adopt a multiple of 27 despite the fact that the buildings acquired are over 30 years old. Nor does it come with grace from the appellant to contend against the belting method since he himself had asked for its application before the Collector and the trial Court.\r\n\r\nCourt is thus satisfied that there is no law, no fact, which comes to the rescue of the appellant and his appeal, virtually against concurrent findings of fact, therefore deserves to be, and is hereby, dismissed with costs. ','Daya Singh Lahoria Vs Union Of India And Ors With\nSpecial Leave Petition (Crl.) Nos. 2697-2698  of 2000.\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nPATTANAIK,J.\nLITTTTTTTJ\n\n    The Writ Petition and the Special Leave Petitions raised\nthe common question, and as such were heard together and are\ndisposed  of by this common judgment.  The grievance of	 the\npetitioner Daya Singh Lahoria, in the Writ Petition is, that\nthe  Criminal Courts in the country have no jurisdiction  to\ntry  in respect of offences which do not form a part of	 the\nextradition  judgment by virtue of which the petitioner	 has\nbeen  brought  to this country and he can be tried only	 for\nthe  offences  mentioned  in the  Extradition  Decree.	 The\npetitioner  has	 also  prayed for quashing of  the  FIR	 and\ncharge	sheet  against	him which are not  included  in	 the\nextradition judgment of the USA Court.	It appears, that the\nUnited	States District of Texas Fort Worth Division  issued\nthe  judgment  of certification of extraditability  and	 the\nsaid  decree  certifies to sustain under Extradition  Treaty\nbetween	 the  United  States  and  the	United	Kingdom	 and\nNorthern  Ireland  with the Government of Republic of  India\nand  specifies the offences for which the accused, mentioned\nin  the	 extradition  order  could  be	tried.	 It  is	 the\ncontention of the petitioner that he cannot be tried for the\noffences   other   than	 the   offences	 mentioned  in	 the\nextradition  order  as	that  would be	a  contravention  of\nSection	  21  of  the  Extradition   Act  as  well  as	 the\ncontravention of the provisions of the International Law and\nthe very Charter of Extradition Treaty.\n\n    The	 Special Leave Applications are directed against the\norder of Rajasthan High Court wherein the High Court refused\nto  entertain  a  Habeas  Corpus  Petition  and	 decide	 the\nquestion  as  to  the jurisdiction of the  Designated  Court\nunder  the  provisions	of   the  Terrorist  and  Disruptive\nActivities  (Prevention)  Act, 1987, on the ground  that  an\nobjection  to  the  said jurisdiction could  be	 made  under\nSection	 18 of the Act before the very Designated Court	 and\nan application for issuance of a Writ of Habeas Corpus would\nnot lie.  The question for consideration in the said Special\nLeave  Petitions,  therefore, is whether an accused, who  is\nbeing  tried  in respect of offences under  the	 Extradition\nTreaty	can  be tried for any other offence which  does	 not\nform  a part of the decree in view of the specific provision\ncontained in Section 21 of the Extradition Act, 1962.\n\n    To	consolidate  and  amend	 the  law  relating  to	 the\nextradition of fugitive criminals and to provide for matters\nconnected  therewith, or incidental thereto, the Extradition\nAct of 1962 has been enacted.  Prior to the enactment of the\naforesaid  law of extradition applicable to India was  found\nscattered in the United Kingdom Extradition Act of 1870, the\nFugitive Offenders Act, 1881 and the Indian Extradition Act,\n1903.	The expression extradition means, surrender by one\nState  to  another of a person desired to be dealt with	 for\ncrimes	 of  which  he	has   been  accused  and  which	 are\njusticiable  in the Courts of the other States.	 The  rights\nof  a  citizen	not to be sent out to  foreign	jurisdiction\nwithout	 strict compliance with law relating to	 extradition\nis  a valuable right.  This Extradition Act is a special law\ndealing	 with criminals and accused of certain crimes and it\nprescribes the procedure for trial as well as the embargo in\ncertain contingencies.	The expression extradition offence\nhas  been  defined in Section 2 (c) of the Act to  mean,  in\nrelation  to  a	 foreign  State, being a  treaty  State,  an\noffence	 punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall\nnot  be	 less than one year under the laws of India or of  a\nforeign	 State	and  includes  a  composite  offence.	 The\nexpression  extradition Treaty has been defined in Section\n2(d)  to  mean, a treaty (agreement or arrangement) made  by\nIndia  with  a foreign State relating to the extradition  of\nfugitive  criminals and includes any treaty relating to	 the\nextradition  of fugitive criminals made before the 15th	 day\nof August, 1947, which extends to, and is binding on, India.\nThe  expression	 foreign State is defined in Section  2(e)\nincludes   any	State  outside	 India	and  includes  every\nconstituent  part,  colony  or	dependency  of	such  State.\nSection	 21  of	 the  Extradition Act is  relevant  for	 our\npurpose.\n\n    Section  21, as it stood in the Extradition Act of	1962\nis extracted hereinbelow in extenso:\n\n    Section 21:	 Accused or convicted person surrendered or\nreturned  by foreign State or Commonwealth country not to be\ntried  for previous offence:- Whenever any person accused or\nconvicted  of an offence, which if committed in India, would\nbe  an extradition offence, is surrendered or returned by  a\nforeign	 State	or Commonwealth country, that  person  shall\nnot, until he has been restored or has had an opportunity of\nreturning to that State or country, be tried in India for an\noffence	 committed  prior to the surrender or return,  other\nthan  the  extradition offence proved by the facts on  which\nthe surrender or return is based.\n\n    This  section  is  based  on Section 19  of	 the  United\nKingdom Extradition Act, 1870.	The original Act of 1962 was\namended	 by  Act  66  of  1993.	   Under  the  1962  Act,  a\ndistinction   had  been	  maintained  between	Commonwealth\ncountries  and	foreign States and the foreign	States	were\nconsidered   as	 treaty	 States.    The	  extradition	with\nCommonwealth  countries	 were  separately  governed  by	 the\nSecond	Schedule  of the Act and the Central Government	 was\ngiven	power	under  Chapter	 III  to  conclude   special\nextradition   arrangements  with   respect  to	Commonwealth\ncountries  only.   The amended Act of 1993 enables India  to\nconclude  extradition  treaty with foreign State,  including\nthe   Commonwealth   countries,	   without   treating	them\nstructurally  different.  It provides for  extra-territorial\njurisdiction  over  foreigners for crimes committed by	them\noutside	 India and it incorporates composite offences in the\ndefinition  of	extradition offence.  It excludes  political\noffences  as  a	 defence in cases of offences of  a  serious\nnature	and  it covers extradition requests on the basis  of\ninternational  convention.   It	 also  enables	the  Central\nGovernment  to	make  and receive requests  for	 provisional\narrest	of fugitives in urgent cases pending the receipt  of\nthe  formal extradition request.  Section 21 of 1962 Act was\nsubstituted by Act 66 of 1993, as follows:\n\n\n    Section 21	Accused or convicted person surrendered or\nreturned  by  foreign  State  not to be	 tried	for  certain\noffences.   - Whenever any person accused or convicted of an\noffence,   which,  if  committed  in   India  would  be	  an\nextradition offence, is surrendered or returned by a foreign\nState,	such person shall not, until he has been restored or\nhas  had an opportunity of returning to that State, be tried\nin India for an offence other than.\n\n    (a)	 the extradition offence in relation to which he was\nsurrendered or returned;  or\n\n    (b) any lesser offence disclosed by the facts proved for\nthe  purposes of securing his surrender or return other than\nan  offence in relation to which an order for his  surrender\nor return could not be lawfully made;  or\n\n    (c)	 the  offence in respect of which the foreign  State\nhas given its consent.\n\n    The	  provision   of  the	aforesaid   Section   places\nrestrictions  on  the trial of the person extradited and  it\noperates  as a bar to the trial of the fugitive criminal for\nany  other  offence  until the condition of  restoration  or\nopportunity  to return is satisfied.  Under the amended	 Act\nof 1993, therefore, a fugitive could be tried for any lesser\noffence,  disclosed  by	 the facts proved or  even  for	 the\noffence	 in respect of which the foreign State has given its\nconsent.   It thus, enables to try the fugitive for a lesser\noffence, without restoring him to the State or for any other\noffence, if the State concerned gives its consent.  In other\nwords,	it may be open for our authorities to obtain consent\nof  the	 foreign  State to try the fugitive  for  any  other\noffence	 for  which  the extradition decree might  not	have\nmentioned,  but	 without obtaining such consent, it  is	 not\npossible  to  try  for	any other offence,  other  than	 the\noffence	 for which the extradition decree has been obtained.\nThe  Extradition  Treaty contains several articles of  which\nArticle	 7 is rather significant for our purpose, which	 may\nbe quoted hereinbelow in extenso:-\n\n    Article 7.	A person surrendered can in no case be kept\nin  custody or be brought to trial in the territories of the\nHigh  Contracting Party to whom the surrender has been	made\nfor  any other crime or offence, or on account of any  other\nmatters,  than	those for which the extradition	 shall	have\ntaken  place,  until  he has been restored, or	has  had  an\nopportunity  of	 returning, to the territories of  the	High\nContracting Party by whom he has been surrendered.\n\n    This  stipulation  does n Removal Act, 1962 - Section 21 - an outlaw brought into this nation under an Extradition Decree can be attempted just for the offenses specified in the Extradition Decree and for no other offense and the Criminal Courts of this nation will have no purview to attempt such outlaw for whatever other offense. ','State Of T.N Vs Ananthi Ammal The Judgmenttt of the Court was delivered by S.P. BHARUCHA, J.-\r\n\r\nCivil Appeal No. 3312 of 1981\r\n\r\n1.This appeal by special leave is filed by the State of Tamil Nadu against the judgment and order of the High Court of Madras dated 9-9-1981, where by the Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for Harijan Welfare Schemes Act, 1978, was struck down as being ultra vires the Constitution of India. The High Court came to the conclusion that the said Act did not enjoy the protection of Articles 31-C or 31-A and that it was violative of Articles 14, 19 and 300-A of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n2.Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the said Act was not violative of Article 14 or Article 19 or Article 300-A and that, in any event, it was protected by reason of Article 31 A. Learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the said Act was violative of Article 14 inasmuch as it was enacted to acquire lands for a purpose which could as well be served by the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, and that a comparison of the provisions of the said Act with those of the Land Acquisition Act showed that the provisions of the said Act were far harsher insofar as the landowner was concerned. Learned counsel for the respondents also submitted that the said Act did not enjoy the protection conferred by Article 31-C notwithstanding the declaration in that behalf contained in Section 2 thereof.\r\n\r\n3.The said Act contains in Section 2 the declaration aforementioned, namely, that it is enacted to give effect to the policy of the State towards securing the principles laid down in Part IV and, in particular, Article 46 of the Constitution. It is enacted to provide for acquisition of land for Harijan Welfare Schemes.\r\n\r\n4.Section 3 of the said Act is the definition section. It defines &#39;Court&#39; to mean, in the city of Madras, the Madras City Civil Court and elsewhere, the Subordinate Judge&#39;s Court having jurisdiction, and if there is no such Subordinate Judge&#39;s Court, the District Court having jurisdiction. A &quot;Harijan Welfare Scheme&quot; is defined to mean any scheme for provision of house sites for Harijans, for constructing, extending or improving any dwelling house for Harijans, for providing any burial or burning ground for Harijans, for providing any pathway leading to such dwelling house, burial or burning ground or for providing any other amenity for the benefit of Harijans. Sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the said Act read thus:\r\n\r\n&quot;4. Power to acquire land.- (1) Where the District Collector is satisfied that for the purpose of any Harijan Welfare Scheme, it is necessary to acquire any land, he may acquire the land by publishing in the District Gazette a notice to the effect that he has decided to acquire the land in pursuance of this section. (2)Before publishing a notice under sub- section (1), the District Collector or any officer authorised by the District Collector in this behalf, shall call upon the owner or any other person, who, in the opinion of the District Collector or the officer so authorised may be interested in such land, to show cause why it should not be acquired. (3)(a) The District Collector may, where he has himself called upon the owner or other person to show cause under sub-section (2), pass such orders as he may deem fit on the cause so shown;\r\n\r\n(b)Where any officer authorised by the District Collector has called upon the owner or other person to show cause under sub- section (2), the officer so authorised shall make a report to the District Collector containing his recommendations on the cause so shown for the decision of the District Collector. After considering such report the District Collector may pass such orders as he may deem fit.\r\n\r\n5.Land acquired to vest in Government free from all encumbrances.- When a notice under sub-section (1) of Section 4 is published in the District Gazette, the land to which the said notice relates shall, on and from the date on which the notice is so published vest absolutely in the Government free from all encumbrances.\r\n\r\n6.Right to receive amount.- Every person having any interest in any land acquired under this Act shall be entitled to receive and be paid an amount as hereinafter provided.\r\n\r\n7.Determination of amount.- (1) The amount payable in respect of any land acquired under this Act shall be the market value of such land on the date of publication of the notice under sub-section (1) of Section 4.&quot; Section 8 sets out the matters that are to be ignored in determining the amount under Section 7. Section 9 entitles any person who does not agree with the amount determined by the prescribed authority under Section 7(2) to prefer an appeal to the &#39;Court&#39; within such period as may be prescribed. Sub-section (1) of Section 10 requires the prescribed authority to determine who, in his opinion, are entitled to receive the amount where several persons claim to be interested therein and what is payable to each of them. Sub- section (2) states that where a dispute arises in this behalf the prescribed authority may refer it for the decision of the court and the court must, in deciding such dispute, follow the provisions of Part III of the Land Acquisition Act. Section 11 reads thus: &quot;11. Payment of amount.- (1) After the amount has been determined, the prescribed authority shall tender payment of the amount to the persons entitled thereto and shall pay it to them-\r\n\r\n(i)in a lump sum in a case where it does not exceed two thousand rupees,and\r\n\r\n(ii)in all other cases, in such number of equal annual instalments not exceeding five as may be determined by the prescribed authority and the amount of each such annual instalment shall not be less than two thousand rupees: Provided that where the balance of the amount due in any instalment is less than two thousand rupees, only the actual amount so due shall be paid.\r\n\r\n(2)If the persons entitled to the amount do not consent to receive it or if there be no person competent to alienate the land, or if there be any dispute as to the title to receive the amount, or as to the apportionment of it, the prescribed authority shall deposit the amount in the Court, and the Court shall deal with the amount so deposited in the manner laid down in Sections 32 and 33 of the Land Acquisition &#39;Act, 1894 (Central Act I of 1894).&quot;\r\n\r\nSection 12 provides for payment of interest. It says that when the compensation amount is not paid or deposited on or before taking possession of the land, the prescribed authority shall pay it with interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the time of taking possession until payment. Section 13 reads thus:\r\n\r\n&quot;13. Appeal to High Court.- Subject to the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Central Act V of 1908) applicable to appeals from original decrees, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any enactment for the time being in force, a second appeal shall lie to the High Court from any decision of the Court under this Act, if the amount as determined by the prescribed authority exceeds such sum as may be prescribed.&quot;\r\n\r\nSection 20 states that the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, save as provided in the said Act, shall cease to apply to any land which is required for the purpose specified in Section 4(1) and such land shall be acquired only in accordance with the provisions of the said Act. Section 22 reads thus:\r\n\r\n&quot;22. Application of the Act to certain pending cases of acquisition.- (1) The provisions of this Act shall apply also to any case or cases in which proceedings have been started before the commencement of this Act for the acquisition of any land for the Harijan Welfare Scheme under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (Central Act I of 1894) (hereinafter in this section referred to as the said Act) but no award has been made by the Collector under Section 11 of the said Act before such commencement, as if-\r\n\r\n(i) the notification published under sub- section (1) of Section 4 of the said Act, or\r\n\r\n(ii)the declaration made under Section 6 of the said Act, or\r\n\r\n(iii)the notice given under sub-section (1) of Section 9 of the said Act, were a notice to show cause against the acquisition of the land served under sub- section (2) of Section 4 of this Act. (2)Nothing contained in sub-section (1) shall apply in relation to any land unless and until after&#39; the District Collector has published a notice in the District Gazette to the effect that the said land is required for the purpose specified in sub-section (1) of Section 4 of this Act.&quot;\r\n\r\n5. It was submitted by learned counsel for the respondents that no enquiry as required by Section 5 of the Land Acquisition Act was contemplated by the said Act. Whereas it was the Government which was required to consider objections and the need for acquisition and make a declaration thereafter that the land was required for a public purpose under the Land Acquisition Act, it was, under the said Act, left to the District Collector to be satisfied that the land was required for the purpose of a Harijan Welfare Scheme. No enquiry into the value of the land was contemplated under the said Act inasmuch as a provision equivalent to Section 11 of the Land Acquisition Act was not to be found in the said Act.\r\n\r\nWhereas the Land Acquisition Act set out the matters that were required to be considered for the purposes of award of compensation there was no such provision in the said Act. The said Act did not provide for a reference to the court in regard to a claim for enhancement of compensation in the manner of Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act; it provided only for an appeal to the court and, having regard to the terms of Section 9, that appeal was restricted to the amount of solatium payable under Section 7(2) of the said Act. Section 11 of the said Act provided for the payment of the compensation amount in instalments in the event that the amount thereof exceeded Rs 2000. Section 13 of the said Act provided for a second appeal to the High Court only if the amount as determined by the prescribed authority exceeded such sum as might be prescribed. This sum, it may be mentioned, was at the relevant time Rs.50,000, which was the amount prescribed for the purposes of all second appeals to the High Court under the rules for the purpose.\r\n\r\n6. In State of M.P v. G.C. Mandawar1 a Constitution Bench held that Article 14 does not authorise the striking down of the law of one State on the ground that, in contrast with the law of another State on the same subject, its provisions are discriminatory, nor does it contemplate the law of the Centre or of a State dealing with similar subjects being held to be unconstitutional by a process of comparative study of the provisions of the two. The sources of authority for the two being different, Article 14 can have no application. In Sant Lal Bharti v. State of Punjab2 this was reiterated.\r\n\r\n7. When a statute is impugned under Article 14 what the court has to decide is whether the statute is so arbitrary or unreasonable that it must be struck down. At best, a statute upon a similar subject which derives its authority from another source can be referred to, if its provisions have been held to be reasonable or have stood the test of time, only for the purpose of indicating what may be said to be reasonable in the context. We proceed to examine the provisions of the said Act upon this basis.\r\n\r\n8. Sub-section (1) of Section 4 empowers the District Collector, if he is satisfied that it is necessary to acquire some land for the purpose of a Harijan Welfare Scheme, to acquire that land by publishing in the District Gazette a notice to the effect that he has decided to acquire it in pursuance of Section 4. Sub-section (2) of Section 4 obliges the District Collector or any officer authorised by him in this behalf to call upon the owner or any other person who, in the opinion of the District Collector or the officer so authorised, is interested in such land to show cause why it should not be acquired. Where the District Collector has called upon the owner or other person to show cause under sub-section (2), clause (a) of sub-section (3) requires him to pass orders on the cause so shown. Where an officer authorised by the District Collector has called upon the owner or other person to show cause under sub-section (2), clause (b) of Section 3 requires that officer to report to the District Collector his recommendations on the cause so shown and the 1 (1955) 1 SCR 599 AIR 1954 SC 493 2 (1988) 1 SCC 366 (1988) 2 SCR 107 District Collector is required to pass such orders as he may deem fit after considering the report. Sub-section (2) of Section 4, therefore, obliges the acquiring authority to serve notice upon the landowner and other persons interested in the land to show cause why it should not be acquired. By reason of sub-section (3) of Section 4, such cause has to be taken into account and orders passed in respect thereof. It is only thereafter that the acquiring authority can arrive at the satisfaction that it is necessary to acquire the land. The provisions of Section 4, therefore, substantially encapsulate the provisions of Sections 4 to 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, the only major difference being that, under the said Act, it is the District Collector and not the State Government who must be satisfied that the land is required to be acquired. It does not appear to us that this is a provision whi ch is unreasonable or arbitrary.\r\n\r\n9.By reason of Section 5, the land in respect of which notice under Section 4(1) is published vests absolutely in the State\r\n This appeal by special leave is filed by the State of Tamil Nadu against the judgment and order of the High Court of Madras dated 9-9-1981, where by the Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for Harijan Welfare Schemes Act, 1978, was struck down as being ultra vires the Constitution of India. The High Court came to the conclusion that the said Act did not enjoy the protection of Articles 31-C or 31-A and that it was violative of Articles 14, 19 and 300-A of the Constitution. These civil appeals each party shall bear and pay its own costs.\r\n ','D.B. Madan Vs Commissioner Of Income-Tax JUDGMENT\r\n\r\n1. Heard learned counsel on both sides.

The High Court declined to call upon the Appellate Tribunal to state a case and refer a question of law said to arise out of the Tribunal&#39;s appellate order for its opinion. The circumstance that, in doing so, the High Court relied on a decision which in turn followed an earlier one in CIT v. T.S. Hajee Moosa and Co. (Mad) implied that a question of law did arise, but the question, in view of the earlier decision, was held as not a referable question of law. It is always open to the High Court to follow its earlier decision and answer the question of law one way or the other according as whether the view taken in the earlier case commends itself to it or whether, in its opinion, that earlier view needs reconsideration. But it cannot always be said that, in all cases where a similar question of law had been answered in an earlier case in a\r\n High Court declined to call upon the Appellate Tribunal to state a case and refer a question of law said to arise out of the Tribunal&#39;s appellate order for its opinion.

Hindustan Co-operative Insurance Society Ltd., 58 I.A. 259, Ramswarup v. Munshi &amp; Ors. [1963] 3 SCR 858; Bolani Ores Ltd. v. State of Orissa, [1975] 2 SCR 138; referred to.\r\n\r\n(c) Section 55 is an instance of legislation by incorporation and not legislation by reference. In enacting s. 55 the legislature did not want to confer an unlimited right of appeal but wanted to restrict it. It found that the grounds set out in the then existing s. 100 CPC were appropriate for restricting the right of appeal and hence incorporated them in s.55. The legislature could never have intended to limit the right of appeal to any ground or grounds which might from time to time find place in s. 100 without knowing what those grounds were. [1063 B-D]\r\n\r\n(d) Secondly, the Act is a self-contained code and it is not possible to believe that the legislature could have made the right of appeal under such a code dependent on the viscititudes of a section in another statute. [1063 F]\r\n\r\n(e) That apart, an indissoluble link between s. 55 and s. 100, CPC would lead to a startling result. If, for example, s. 100 were repealed, s. 55 would be reduced to futility and the right of appeal under the Act would be wholly gone. It would be absurd to place on the language of s. 55 an interpretation which might in a given situation result in denial of the right of appeal altogether and thus defeat the plain object and purpose of the section. [1063 H]\r\n\r\n(f) Even assuming that the right of appeal under s.55 is restricted to the ground specified in the new s. 100 CPC the present appeal would still be maintainable because it involves a substantial question of law relating to the interpretation of s. 13(2) of the Act. [1064 D]\r\n\r\n(g) The test for determining whether a question of law raised in an appeal is a substantial question of law is to see whether it is of general public importance or whether it directly or substantially affects the rights of parties and if so whether it is an open question in the sense that it is not finally settled by this Court or by the Privy Council or by the Federal Court or is not free from difficulty or call for discussion of alternative views. [1064 E] Sir Chunilal V. Mehta &amp; Sons Ltd. v. The Century Spinning and Manufacturing Co. Ltd., [1962] Supp. 3 SCR 549; referred to.\r\n\r\nIn the present case the appeal clearly involves a substantial question of law within the meaning of the Act, because the interpretation of s. 13(2) directly and substantially affects the rights of the parties and is not finally settled by this Court.\r\n\r\n2(a) The words &quot;in the manner in which it was made-&#39; occurring in s. 13(2) have no bearing on the content or the scope and ambit of the power but merely indicate the procedure to be followed by the Commission in amending or revoking an order made by it. [1064 H]\r\n\r\n(b) The power conferred under s. 13(2) is of the widest amplitude and in this respect it is unlike s. 22 of the English Act. This power is intended to ensure that the order passed is and continues to be in conformity with the requirements of the Act, and the trade practice condemned by the order is really and truly a restrictive trade practices and it must therefore, be construed in a wide sense so as to effectuate the object and purpose of the grant of the power. [1065 B]\r\n\r\n(c) The powers under s. 13(2) and s. 55 are distinct and independent powers and one cannot be read as subject to the other. The scope and applicability of s. 13(2) is not cut down by the provision for appeal under s. 55. It is perhaps because the right of appeal given under s. 55 is limited to a question of law that a wide and unfettered power is conferred on the Commission to amend or revoke an order in appropriate cases. [1066 A]\r\n\r\n(d) The conferment of such wide and unusual power under s. 13(2) was necessary to ensure that an erroneous order is capable of being corrected. An order made under s. 37 or under any other provision of the Act may affect not only the parties before the Commission but also others such as the whole net-work of distributors or dealers who were not before the Commission. It may also affect the entire trade in the product. There may be some Facts or circumstances having a crucial bearing on the determination of the enquiry which, if taken into account, may result in a different order being made or some fact or circumstance may arise which may expose the invalidity of the order or render it bad. There may be a material change in the relevant circumstances subsequent to the making of the order. Therefore, by its very nature. the order of the Commission is transient or pro-tempore and must be liable to be altered or revoked according as there is material change in the relevant economic facts and circumstance. [1366 B-E]\r\n\r\n(e) But howsoever large may be the power under s. 13(2), it cannot be construed to be so wide as to permit a rehearing on the same material without anything more with a view to showing that the order was wrong on facts. [1067]\r\n\r\n(f) When Regulation 85 says that the provisions of s. 114 and O. XLVII, r. 1 CPC shall as far as may, be applied to the proceedings under s. 13(2) it cannot be read to mean that an application under s. 13(2) can be maintained only on the grounds set out in s. 114 and O. XLVII r. 1. This regulation does not in any manner limit the width and amplitude of the power under s. 13(2). A good part of it is procedural in nature and has nothing to do with the grounds on which an application under s. 13(2) may be maintained. The words &quot;as far as may&quot; occurring in its last part do not indicate that an application under s. 13(2) can be maintained only on the grounds set out in s. 114 and O. XLVII, r. 1, CPC. All that they indicate is that the provisions of s. 114 and O. XLVII, r. 1 are to be invoked only to the extent applicable, and if in a given case they are not applicable they may be ignored; but that does not mean that the power conferred under s. 13 (2) would not be exercisable in such a case. The reference to the provisions of s. 114 and O. XLVII, r. 1 does not limit the grounds on which an application may be made under s. 13(2). Clearly, therefore, even if a case does not fall within s. 114 and O. XLVII, r. 1, the Commission would have power in an appropriate case to amend or revoke an order made by it in the exercise of its power under s. 13(2). [1067 E-H] 3(a) The power of the Commission under s. 13(2) was exercisable in the present case and the order dated 14th May 1976 was liable to be revoked. [1077 B]\r\n\r\n(b) The submission of the distributorship agreement for registration under s. 33 cannot be construed as admission on the appellant&#39;s part that the clauses in the agreement constituted restrictive trade practices. The appellant had possibly submitted the agreement for registration on the erroneous view (which was also the view of the Commission in the Telco case) that the moment an agreement contains a trade practice falling within any of the clauses of s. 33(1) the trade practice must, irrespective of whether it falls within the definition of s. 2(o) or not, be regarded as a restrictive trade practice and the agreement must be registered. The question whether a particular trade practice is restrictive or not is essentially a question of law based on the application of the definition in s. 2(o) to the facts of a given case and no admission on a question of law can ever be used, in evidence against the make of the admission. Therefore, even assuming that there was an admission in submitting the agreement for registration it could not be used as evidence against the appellant in the enquiry under s. 37. [1075 C-G]\r\n\r\n(c) There was nothing in the conduct of the appellant which would amount to acquiescence or raise an estoppel against it. The appellant did not at any time, accept the impugned order knowing that it was erroneous. There can be no acquiescence without knowledge of the right to repudiate or challenge. [1068 H]\r\n\r\n(d) Neither did the failure of the appellant to prefer an appeal amount to acquiescence on its part because an application under s. 13(2), which is An alternative and a more effective remedy, was available to it. [1069 G]\r\n\r\n(e) The fact that the appellant did not implement the impugned order by entering into revised distributorship agreements with its distributors also showed that there was no acquiescence on its part so far as the order dated 14th May 1976 was concerned. [1070 C]\r\n\r\n(f) Estoppel can arise only if a party to a proceeding had altered his position on the faith of a representation or promise made by another. In the instant case there is nothing to show that the Registrar had altered his position on the basis of the application for extension of time made by the appellant. [1107 D] 4(a). The order of the Commission was bad because it was based on no material and, could not possibly have been made by the Commission. [1076 A-B]\r\n\r\n(b) The definition of restrictive trade practice in the Act is, to some extent, based on the rule of reason evolved by American courts while interpreting a similar provision in the Sherman Act. The rule of reason normally requires ascertainment of facts or features peculiar to the particular business, its condition before and after the restraint was imposed, the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable, the history of the restraint and the evil believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular restraint and the purpose sought to be attained. It is only on a consideration of these factors that it can be decided whether a particular act, contract or agreement imposing the restraint is unduly restrictive of competition so as to constitute restraint of trade. Certain restraint of trade are unreasonable per se because of their pernicious effect on competition and lack of any redeeming virtue; they are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and, therefore, illegal without elaborate enquiry as to the precise harm they have caused or the business execuse for their use. In such cases illegality does not depend on a showing of the unreasonableness of the practice and it is unnecessary to have a trial to show the nature, extent and degree of its market effect. [1074 A, B; 1075 A-B]\r\n\r\n(c) It is now settled law that every trade practice which is in restraint of trade is not necessarily restrictive trade practice. If a trade practice merely regulates and thereby promotes competition it would not fall within the definition even if it is to some extent in restraint of trade. Therefore, the question whether a trade practice is a restrictive trade practice or not has the decided not on any theoretical or a priori reasoning. but by inquirie whether it has or may have the effect of preventing distorting or restricting competition. The peculiar facts and features of the trade would be very much relevant in determining this question. [1072 H]\r\n\r\n(d) In the Telco case this Court laid down that an application by the Registrar under s. 10(a) (iii) must contain facts which in his opinion constitute restrictive trade practice and show or establish as to how the alleged clauses constitute restrictive trade practice in the context of the facts. But even if the application does not set out any facts or features showing how the trade practices complained of by the Registrar are restrictive practices, the Registrar can still, at the hearing of the enquiry, in the absence of any demand for particulars being made by the opposite party produce material before the Commission disclosing facts or features which go to establish the restrictive nature of the trade practice complained of and if that is done, the defect in the application would not be of much consequence. [1070 G-H] In the instant case the burden of producing the necessary material that the impugned trade practices had the actual or probable effect of diminishing or destroying competition and were therefore restrictive trade practices was on the Registrar who made on application before the Commission. No material beyond reproducing the impugned clauses of the agreement and the words of the relevant sections having been produced, the application of the Registrar was contrary to the law laid down by this Court. Therefore, the Commission had no basis for making its order dated 14th May 1976.\r\n\r\n(e) The argument that the trade practices referred to in the offending clauses were per se restrictive trade practices and in any event, even if any supporting material was necessary, it was to be found in the admission of the appellant contained in its letter submitting the distributorship agreement for registration was without any force.\r\n\r\n5(a). When the issue before the court is whether a practice trade practice set out in an agreement has or may have the effect of preventing, distorting or restricting competition so as to constitute a restrictive trade practice, it is the actual or probable effect of the trade practice which has to be judged and there is no question of contradicting, varying, adding to or substracting from the terms of the agreement by admitting extraneous evidence. The various factors stated earlier are required to be taken into account only for the purpose of determining the actual or probable effect of the trade practice referred to in the particular clause. In such a case it is not right to shut out oral evidence to determine the actual or probable effect of the trade practice. [1078 D-E]\r\n\r\n(b) It is not s. 33(1) which invalidates a clause in an agreement relating to a trade practice but it is the restrictive nature of the trade practice as set out in s. 2(o) which makes it void. [1079 E]\r\n\r\n(c) When a question of restrictive trade practice arises in relation to a clause in an agreement it is the trade practice in the clause that has to be examined for determining its actual or probable effect on competition. A clause in an agreement may proprio vigore impose a restraint. Where such restraint produces or is reasonably likely to produce the prohibited statutory effect it would clearly constitute a restrictive trade practice and the clause would be bad. [1108 D-E] Tata Engineering &amp; Locomotive Co. Ltd., Bombay,, v. The Registrar of the Restrictive Trade Agreement New Delhi, [1977] 2 SCR 685, applied.\r\n\r\nObservations in Hindustan Lever Ltd. v. M.R.T.P. [1977] 3 SCR 455; disapproved.\r\n\r\n(d) In a case where a clause in agreement does not by- itself impose any restraint but empowers the manufacturer or supplier to take some action which may be restrictive of competition, the mere possibility of action being taken, which may be restrictive of competition, would not in all cases affect the legality of the clause. What is required to be considered for determining the legality of the clause is whether there is a real probability that the presence of the clause itself would be likely to restrict competition. This is basically a question of market effect and cannot be determined by adopting a doctrainaire approach. Each case would have to be examined on its own facts from a business and commonsense point of view. It cannot, therefore, be said that in every case where the clause is theoretically capable of being so utilised as to unjustifiably restrict competition it would constitute a restrictive trade practice. [1081 E-H] 6(a). The order dated 14th May 1976 was clearly vitiated by an error of law apparent on the face of the record inasmuch as it contained only the final and operative order without giving any reasons in support of it. [1083 E]\r\n\r\n(b) The two conditions precedent before the Commission can pass a cease and desist order are (i) it must be found that the trade practice complained of is a restrictive trade practice and (ii) where such a finding is reached the Commission must be satisfied that none of the &quot;gateways&quot; pleaded in answer to the complaint exists. [1082 D-E]\r\n\r\n(c) In the instant case the appellant did not appear before the Commission and no &#39;gateways&quot; were pleaded and therefore the question of the Commission arriving at a satisfaction in regard to &quot;gateways&quot; did not arise. Nonetheless the Commission was required to be satisfied that the trade practices complained of were restrictive trade practices. The order dated 14th May 1976 did not contain any discussion showing that the Commission had reached the requisite satisfaction. It gave merely bald directions without any reasons. The ex-parte character of the order did not absolve the Commission from the obligation to give reasons in support of the order because the appellant would have been entitled to prefer an appeal even against on ex-parte order and in the absence of reasons, the appellant would not be in a position to attack the order in appeal. It is well established that every quasi-judicial order must be supported by reasons. [1082 E-H] N.M. Desai v. Textiles Ltd., C.A. 245 of 1970, dec. On 17th Dec., 1975; Simons Engineering Co. v.

Datar and Girish Chandra for Respondent No. 2.\r\n\r\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATI, J.-This appeal under section 55 of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) raises interesting questions of law relating to the interpretation and application of certain provisions of the Act. The facts giving rise to the appeal are for the most part undisputed and they may be briefly stated as follows:\r\n\r\nThe appellant is a public limited company engaged in manufacture and sale of jeep motor vehicles and their Spare parts and accessories. Since 1947 the appellant was marketing and distri-\r\n\r\nbuting jeep motor vehicles and it had set up a large and complex net work of dealers, who were described as distributors, for marketing and after sale service of such vehicles. In or about 1956 the appellant started manufacturing its own jeep motor vehicles and since then it has been manufacturing such vehicles and distributing and marketing the same through its net work of distributors. The appellant has appointed these distributors for marketing and sale of jeep motor vehicles on certain terms and conditions contained in a standard distributorship agreement. The material clauses of this agreement read as follows:\r\n\r\n&quot;Section (3): TERRITORY OF DISTRIBUTOR:-` The Company grants to Distributor the non-exclusive privilege (except as hereinafter provided) of selling at re tail and the right (except hereinafter provided) to appoint in writing by forms of agreements approved by the Company, Dealers to sell at retail the products enumerated in Section 2 of this agreement, within the following territory and also demarcated in the map attached hereto and which forms a part of this agreement.\r\n\r\nDistributor accepts the above retail setting privileges and agrees to develop with diligence the sales of sale products in said territory in accordance with this agreement and undertakes to achieve the quantum of sales in the territory as may be fixed by the Company from time to time.\r\n\r\nSection (4): LIMITATIONS ON TERRITORIAL RIGHTS:-\r\n\r\n(i) Distributor agrees not to solicit outside of the territory described in Section 3-the purchase of any products.\r\n\r\n* * * * Section (6): PRICE AND PAYMENT :-Distributor will pay for products the Company&#39;s established Distributor net prices in effect on date on despatch. Price lists will be furnished to Distributor by the Company, but the Company reserves the right to change prices at any time without notice.\r\n\r\n* * * * Section (11): PRICE CHANGES :-If the Company reduces its published suggested retail list price, for any current model of &#39;Jeep&#39; motor vehicles, the company will make an allowance to Distributor as hereinafter provided. The allowance shall be made in respect of new and unused &#39;Jeep&#39; Motor Vehicles of the then current model in respect of which the price change has been made which `have been purchased by Distributor from the Company within a period of 30 (thirty) days prior to the effective date of such decrease in suggested list price, and which distributor shall have in his unsold stock on such effective date. The allowance shall be equal to the difference between the net amount paid to the Company for such &#39;Jeep&#39; Motor Vehicle (less all allowance thereto granted), and the net amount which would have been paid had such &#39;Jeep&#39; motor vehicles been purchased at the reduced price. No allowance, how ever, shall be made unless there is a reduction in the RETAIL list price and increases in discounts, bonuses and the like shall in no event be considered as a reduction in price.\r\n\r\n* * * * Section (17): CARE OF OWNER AND CUSTOMER RELATIONS :- Distributor agrees-\r\n\r\n* * * *\r\n\r\n(a) To refrain from selling or offering for sale any competing product. The Company shall be the sole judge as to whether a product is competing or not&quot;\r\n\r\nThe appellant by its letter dated 27th January, 1971 submitted to the Registrar of Restrictive Trade Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the Registrar) certified copies of agreements entered into by the appellant with the Distributors for registration, since in the opinion of the appellant, they were registrable under the provisions of Ch. V of the Act. The appellant also submitted to the Registrar along with its letter dated 19th May, 1972 four copies of the standard distributorship agreement for registration in terms of cl. (ii) of Rule 12 of the Monopolies Restrictive Trade Practices Rules, 1970 (hereinafter referred to as the Rules) and the standard distributorship agreement was registered by the Registrar under section 35 of the Act.\r\n\r\nOn 17th December, 1975 the Registrar made an application to 11 the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission (hereinafter referred to as the Commission) under section 10(a) (iii) of the Act pointing out to the Commission that the standard distributorship agreement entered into by the appellant with the distributors was filed by the appellant for registration in the office of the Registrar and the same had been duly registered under section 35 of the Act. The Registrar drew the attention of the Commission to clauses (3), (4), (5), (6), (11), (13), (14), (17) and (20) of the standard distributorship agreement and claimed that the provisions contained in these clauses related &quot;to restrictive trade practices relating to imposing restrictions on persons and classes of persons to whom goods are sold and from whom goods are bought tie-up sales/full-line forcing; exclusive dealing; granting or allowing concessions; discounts, over- riding commission, etc. in connection with or by reason of dealings; resale price maintenance; and allocation of area/market for disposal of products covered under the agreement, respectively attracting clauses (a), (b), (c),\r\n\r\n(e), (f) and (g) of section 33(1) and/or section 2(o) of the Act&quot; and that these restrictive trade practices had and might have the effect of preventing, distorting and restricting competition and tended to bring about monopolisation of prices and conditions of delivery and to affect the flow of supplies in the market relating to goods covered under the standard distributorship agreement in such manner as to impose on the consumers unjustified costs and restrictions and the same were prejudicial to public interest. The Registrar prayed on the basis of these allegations that the Commission be pleased to inquire into the restrictive trade practices indulged in by the appellant, under section 37 of the Act and pass such orders as it might deem fit and proper. The Commission, on receipt of this application, decided, in exercise of the powers conferred upon it under sections 10(a) and 37 of the Act, to hold inquiry into the restrictive trade practices complained of by the Registrar and issued notice dated 2nd January, 1976 under Regulation 53 of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission Regulations, 1974 (hereinafter referred to as the Regulations) to the appellant that if the appellant wished to be heard in the proceedings before the Commission, it should comply with the requirements of Regulations 65 and 67 failing which the Commission would proceed with the inquiry in the absence of respondent. The appellant, by its letter dated 3rd February, 1976, acknowledged receipt of the notice and intimated to the Commission that it did not wish to be heard in the proceedings before the Commission but put forward its submissions in regard to the restrictive trade practices alleged by the Registrar in his application. The appellant pointed out that the clauses of the standard distributionship agreement complained of by the Registrar did not constitute restrictive trade practices for the reasons explained in the letter and requested the Deputy Secretary to place their submissions before the Commission at the enquiry to be held by it. The letter was purported to be submitted in terms of Regulations 36(3), but the reference to this Regulation was obviously under some misapprehension because this Regulation occurred in Chapter V which provided the procedure for reference under Chapter III and IV and it had no application in case of an inquiry under section 37 of the Act. The Joint Secretary (Legal) of the Commission pointed out to the appellant by his letter dated 11th February, 1976 that if the appellant wished to be heard in the proceedings, the appellant should comply with the requirements of Regulations 65 and 67 and it is only if the appellant did so, that it could file a reply in answer to the application of the Registrar and moreover, the reply had to be properly drawn and duly verified and declared as provided in those Regulations. The Joint Secretary. (Legal) made it clear that in view of this legal position obtaining under Regulations 65 and 67, it was not possible to take note of contents of the letter addressed by the appellant setting out the explanation for the various clauses impugned in the application of the Registrar. Though this position, in law was specifically pointed out by the Joint Secretary (Legal) on behalf of the Commission, the appellant did not comply with the procedure set out in Regulations 65 and 67 with the result that the Commission decided to proceed exparte against the appellant. The Registrar filed an affidavit of the Assistant Registrar dated 10th May, 1976 in support of the allegations contained in the application but this affidavit surprisingly did not contain any further or other material than that set out in the application. No other evidence, oral or documentary, was produced by the Registrar and the Commission proceeded to decide the issues arising in the enquiry on the basis of the application supported by the affidavit of the Assistant Registrar. The Commission, after going through the application and the affidavit of the Assistant Registrar and hearing the Registrar, made an order dated 14th May, 1976, the operative part of which was in the following terms:\r\n\r\n&quot;(1) The Respondent is hereby restrained and prohibited by any agreement with any distributor to restrict by any method the persons or classes or persons to whom the goods are sold whether such person be retail purchaser or a dealer.\r\n\r\n(2) The Respondent is hereby restrained and prohibited from restricting in any manner, any purchaser whether a dealer or otherwise in the course of its trade from acquir-\r\n\r\ning or otherwise dealing in any goods other than those of the Respondent or the goods of any other person. (3) The Respondent is hereby restrained and prohibited from selling any goods to any distributor, dealer or other wise on the condition that the prices to be charged on resale by the purchaser shall be the prices stipulated by the respondent unless it is clearly stated that prices lower than those prices may be charged. The Respondent is hereby directed that in all future price lists it must state on the cover or on the front page that the prices if any indicated therein as resale prices are maximum prices and that the prices lower than those price may be charged.\r\n\r\n(4) The Respondent is hereby restrained and prohibited from allocating any area or market to any distributor or dealer for the disposal of the Respondent&#39;s goods. (5) The Respondent is hereby restrained and prohibited from preventing any distributor from appointing any dealer of its own choice on such terms and conditions as may be mutually agreed upon between distributors and dealers in cases where the Respondent does not undertake any obligation, liability or responsibility in respect of the dealers.\r\n\r\n(6) The clauses in the agreements relating to the above restrictive trade practices are hereby declared to be void. The practices arising therefore, shall be discontinued and shall not be repeated. (7) The Respondent shall within 3 months from the date of service of this order on it make and file an affidavit before the Commission setting out the manner in which this order has been given effect to. A copy of the said affidavit shall simultaneously be furnished to the Registrar.\r\n\r\n(8) There will be no order as to costs.&quot;\r\n\r\nSince the appellant was required to file an affidavit of compliance within three months as directed by cl. (7) of the Order, the appellant filed an affidavit dated 10th September, 1976 stating that the appellant had fully implemented in practice the directions contained in Paragraphs (1) and (5) of the Order and refrained from enforcing against the distributors any of the clauses which had been declared void by the Commission. The appellant also pointed out that a draft of a new distributorship agreement was being finalised by the appellant with a view to giving effect to the &quot;restrictions and prohibitions&quot; contained in the Order. The Registrar filed an affidavit of the Deputy Registrar dated 27th September, 1976 seeking particulars from the appellant showing how the appellant had implemented the directions contained in the Order. The appellant by its reply dated 11th November, 1976 pointed out that since the date of receipt of the Order, the appellant had not given effect to the trade practices covered by paragraphs (1) to (5) of the Order nor required any of the distributors to abide by the clauses of the standard distributorship agreement relating to those trade practices and on the contrary, intimated to the distributors that the old distributorship agreement would have to be substituted by a new revised agreement. The appellant submitted that since the clauses of the standard distributorship agreement declared void by the Commission were not enforceable in law by the appellant, it did not make any difference whether or not they were deleted from the existing distributorship agreement and in view of the fact that a new revised agreement was being prepared which would comply with the directions contained in the Order, it was not necessary, to effect any amendments in the existing distributorship agreement. It seems that there was a hearing before the Commission on this issue as regards compliance with the directions contained in the Order and the draft of the revised distributorship agreement prepared by the appellant was considered and pursuant to the suggestion made by the Commission, the appellant agreed to amend two clauses in the draft and the Commission by its Order dated 7th December, 1976 directed that the revised distributorship agreement should be filed by the appellant by 31st March, 1977.\r\n\r\nNow, it appears that subsequent to the Order of the Commission dated 7th December, 1976 an important decision was given by this Court in Tata Engineering &amp; Locomotive Co. Ltd., Bombay v. The Registrar of the Restrictive Trade Agreement, New Delhi(&#39;) relating to the interpretation of some of the relevant provisions of the Act bearing on restrictive trade practices. This decision was given in all appeal preferred by Tata Engineering Locomotive Co. Ltd. (herein- after referred to as the Telco against an order made by the Commission in an enquiry under section 37 and it reversed the view taken by the Commission in several important respects. Though this decision was given on 21st January, 1977, it was not fully reported until March 1977 and on reading it, the appellant felt that the order of the Commission dated 14th May, 1976 required reconsideration, as it was contrary to the law laid down in this decision. The appellant accordingly made an application to the Commission on 31st March. 1977 where, besides asking for extension of time for filing a copy of the revised distributorship agreement on the ground that the dealers were spread out all over India and it would take considerable time for execution of the revised distributorship agreement by them, the appellant pointed out that it had not contested the enquiry proceedings under section 37 in the first instance because the decision given by the Commission in the Telco case was directly applicable, but since that decision of the Commission was reversed by this Court in appeal, the appellant was advised to move a suitable application for amendment and/or modification of the Order dated 14th May, 1976 and that was also an additional reason why the time for filing the revised distributorship agreement should be extended, so that the revised distributorship agreement could be in accordance with the directions, if any. which might be given by the Commission on the proposed application. The Commission acceded to the request contained in this application and extended the time for filing the revised distributorship agreement upto 4th June, 1977.\r\n\r\nThe appellant thereafter made an application dated 30th May, 1977 under section 13(2) of the Act read with Regulation 85 for revocation, amendment or modification of the Order of the Commission dated 14th May, 1976. The appellant set out in this application various facts and features relating to its trade of manufacture and sale of Jeep motor vehicles and their spare parts and accessories and enumerated a number of grounds on which the order of the Commission dated 14th May, 1976 deserved to be revised, revoked, amended or otherwise modified. The application was opposed by the Registrar by filing a reply dated. 17th August, 1977. The parties were thereafter heard by the Commission on 26th August, 1977 and pursuant to the directions given by the Commission. affidavits of documents were filed and evidence was recorded on both sides. It appears that in the course of the evidence the appellant came to know that in November 1977 Hindustan Motors Ltd. had introduced in the 6 market diesel trekker which was clearly a competing vehicle and the appellant thereupon applied to the Commission on 30th January. 1978 for amendment of the application by adding a plea that the fact that since November 1977 Hindustan Motor Ltd. had started manufacturing and selling diesel trekker which was a highly competitive product was another material change in the relevant circumstances which justified the revocation, amendment or modification of the Order dated 14th May, 1976. This application for amendment was opposed by the Registrar on the ground that it was made at a very late stage of the proceeding. The Commission did not pass any order on this application for amendment and kept it pending and proceeded to dispose of the main application by an Order dated 28th February, 1978 by which it rejected the main application with costs and added a short order On the same day stating that in view of the order on the main application, there would be no order on the application for amendment. The appellant thereupon preferred the present appeal in this Court under section 55 challenging the validity of the order made by the Commission rejecting the application of the appellant.\r\n\r\nBefore we set out the rival contentions of the parties in the appeal, it would be convenient at this state to refer to the relevant provisions of the Act and the Regulations. Section 2 is the definition section and clause (u) of this section defines &#39;trade practice&#39; to mean &quot;any practice relating to the carrying on of any trade, and includes-(i) anything done by any person which controls or affects the price charged by, or the method of trading of, any trader or any class of traders (ii) a single or isolated action of any person in relation to any trade&quot;. &#39;Restrictive trade practice&#39; is defiled in section 2, clause (o) to mean &quot;a grade practice which has, or may have, the effect of preventing distorting or restricting, competition in any manner and in particular,-(i) which tends to obstruct the flow of capital or resources into the stream of production, or (ii) which tends to bring about manipulation of prices, or conditions of delivery or to affect the flow of supplies in. the market relating to goods or services in such manner as to impose on the consumers unjustified costs or restrictions.&quot; Section 5, subsection (1) provides for the establishment of the Commission which is to consist of a Chairman and not less than two and not more than eight other members to be appointed by the Central Government and sub- section (2) of section 5 lays down that the Chairman shall be a person who is or has been or is qualified to be a judge of the Supreme Court or of a High Court. It is obvious from these two sub-sections of section 5 that the Legislature clearly contemplated that the Commission must have a Chairman who would provide the judicial element and there must be at least two other members who would provide expertise in subjects like economics, law, commerce. accountancy, industry, public affairs or administration. so that there could be a really high-powered expert commission competent and adequate to deal with the various problems which come before it. It, however, appears that the Central Government paid scant regard to this` legislative requirement and though the office of Chairman fell vacant as far back as 9th August, 1976, it failed to make appointment of Chairman until 24th February, 1978. Of the two other members of the Commission one had already resigned earlier and his vacancy was also not filled with the result that the Commission continued with only one member for a period of about 18 months. This was a most unfortunate state of affairs, for it betrayed total lack of concern for the proper constitution and functioning of the Commission and complete neglect of its statutory obligation by the Central Government. We fail to see any reason why the Central Government could not make the necessary appointments and properly constitute the Commission in accordance with the requirements of the Act. It is difficult to believe that legal and judicial talent in the country had become so impoverished that the Central Government could not find a suitable person to fill the vacancy of Chairman for a year and a half. Moreover it must be remembered that the appointments, after all, have to be made from whatever legal and judicial talent is available and the situation is not going to improve by waiting for a year or two: a new star is not going to appear in the legal firmament within such a short time and the appointments cannot be held up indefinitely. Indeed, it is highly undesirable that important quasi-judicial or administrative posts should remain vacant for long periods of time, because apart from impairing the efficiency of the functioning of the statutory authority of the administration. inexplicable delay may shake the confidence of the public in the integrity of the appointments when made. Turning back to the provisions of the Act, we find that section 10(a) (iii) empowers the Commission to inquire into any restrictive trade practice upon an application made to it by the Registrar. The powers of the Commission while holding an enquiry under the Act are enumerated in section 12 and section 13, sub-section (2) provides that &quot;any order made by the Commission may be amended or revoked at any time in the manner in which it was made&quot;. Then follow sections 14 to 19 which deal inter alia with the procedure to be followed by the Commission. We are not concerned with Sections 20 to 32 which occur in Chapters III and IV because they deal with topics other than restrictive trade practices. Chapter V relates to registration of agreements relating to restrictive trade practices and it consists of sections 33 to 36 of which only sections 33 and 35 are material. Sub- section (1) of section 33 provides that any agreement relating to a restrictive trade practice falling within one or more of the categories specified there shall be subject to registration in accordance with the provisions of Ch. V and proceeds to enumerate the categories of restrictive trade practices covered by that provision and section 35 lays down the time within which an agreement falling within section 33, sub-section (1) shall be registered and the procedure to be followed for effectuating such registration. Sections 37 and 38 are the next important sections and they occur in Ch. V headed A &quot;control of certain restrictive trade practices&quot;. Sub-section (1) of section 37 provides that &quot;the Commission may inquire into any restrictive trade practice, whether the agreement, if any, relating thereto has been registered under section 35 or not, which may come before it for inquiry and, if after such inquiry it is of opinion that the practice is prejudicial to the public interest, the Commission may, by order, direct that-(a) the practice shall be discontinued or shall not be repeated, (b) the agreement relating there to shall be void in respect of such restrictive trade practice or shall stand modified in respect thereof in such manner as may be specified in the order&quot;. Section 38, sub-section (1) enacts that for the purposes of any proceedings before the Commission under section 37, a restrictive trade practice shall be deemed to be prejudicial to the public interest unless the Commission is satisfied of any one or more of the circumstances set out in that subsection and is further satisfied, after balancing the competing considerations, that the restriction is not unreasonable. These circumstances specified in sub-section (1) of section 38 render a trade practice permissible even though it is restrictive and provide what have been picturesquely described in the English law as &quot;gateways&quot; out of the prohibition of restrictive trade practices. Section 55 is the next relevant section and it provides that any person aggrieved by any order made by the Central Government under Ch. III or Ch. IV or as the case may be, of the Commission under section 13 or section 37 may, within 60 days from the date of the order, prefer an appeal to the Supreme Court on &quot;one or more of the grounds specified in section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908&quot;. This is the section under which the present appeal has been preferred by the appellant. The last section to which we must refer is section 66 which confers power on the Commission to make Regulations for the efficient performance of its functions under the Act. The Commission has, in exercise of the power conferred by this section, made the Regulations of which three arc material. namely, Regulations 65, 67 and 85. These Regulations, in so far as material, read as follows &quot;Section 65: APPEARANCE OF PARTIES : Every respondent who wishes to be heard in the proceedings shall within 14 days of the service upon him of the copy of the notice of enquiry, enter an appearance in the office of the Commission by delivering to the Secretary six copies of a memorandum stating that the respondent wishes to be heard in the proceedings and containing the name of his advocate having an office in Delhi or New Delhi and duly authorised to accept service of processes and the Secretary shall send one copy of the memorandum to the Registrar in case where proceedings are initiated under sub- clause (iii) of clause (a) of section 10, and in all other cases to the Director of Investigation.&quot; &quot;Section 67: REPLY TO THE NOTICE: Every respondent who has entered an appearance shall within four weeks of his entering appearance deliver to the Secretary a reply to the notice (5 copies) which shall include:-\r\n\r\n(a) particulars of each of the provisions of section 38 of Act on which he intends to rely; and\r\n\r\n(b) particulars of the facts and matters alleged by him to entitle him to rely on such provisions.&quot; &quot;Section 85: AMENDMENT OR REVOCATION OF ORDER ETC.: An application under sub-section (2) of section 13 of the Act for amendment-or revocation of any order made by the Commission in any proceedings shall be supported by evidence on affidavit of the material change in the relevant circumstances or any other fact or circumstances on which the applicant relies. Unless the Commission otherwise directs notice of the application together with copies of the affidavits in support thereof, shall be served on every party who appeared at the hearing of the previous proceedings and every such party shall be entitled to be heard on the application and the provisions of section 114 and Order XLVII of the Code of Civil Procedure, &#39;908 (5 of 1908), shall as far as may, be applied to these proceedings.&quot; It is against the background of these provisions of the Act and the Regulations that we have to determine the question arising for consideration in the appeal.\r\n\r\nThe contention of the appellant in support of the appeal was that the Order dated 14th May, 1976 suffered from various infirmities and was liable to be revoked or in any event modified under section 13(2) of the Act. It was said that the application of the Registrar on which the Order dated 14th May, 1976 was made did not set out any facts or features showing how the trade practices referred to in the application were restrictive of competition so as to constitute restrictive trade practices and merely contained a bald recital of the impugned clause and mechanical reproduction of the language of the relevant sections without anything more. The application of the Registrar was thus not in accordance with the law laid down in the decision of this Court in the Telco case and no order could be made upon it by the Commission. It was also urged that there was no material placed before the Commission by the Registrar on the basis of which the Commission could possibly come to the conclusion that the trade practices referred to in the application were restrictive trade practices. Even if the Commission was justified in proceeding exparte against the appellant, the highest that could be assumed in favour of the Registrar was that the facts set out in the application and the supporting affidavit of the Assistant Registrar would be deemed to be admitted, but, apart from the impugned clauses, no other facts were set out either in the application or in the affidavit of the Assistant Registrar and there was accordingly no evidence on which the order dated 14th May, 1976 could be made by the Commission. It was also contended that the Order dated 14th May, 1976 did not set out any facts peculiar to the trade of the appellant or the conditions before and after the imposition of the restraint or the actual or probable effect of the restraint nor did it indicate as to how the trade practices referred to in the impugned clauses constituted restrictive trade practices; it was a non-speaking order which did not give any reasons at all for holding that the trade practices complained of were restrictive trade practices and hence it was vitiated by a legal infirmity. The appellant further urged that the Order dated 14th May, 1976 was a continuing order as it required the appellant not merely to cease but also to desist from the restrictive trade practices set out in the order and it was, therefore, required to be continually justifiable and since the facts and features of the trade set out in the application of the appellant clearly established that the trade practices referred to in the impugned clauses did not constitute restrictive trade practices, the Order dated 14th May, 1976 was not justified and in any event could not be continued and it was accordingly liable to be revoked or amended under section 13(2). It was submitted that in any event the Order dated 14th May, l 976 was contrary to the law declared by this Court in the Telco case and since the decision in the Telco case was a fact or circumstance subsequent to the making of the Order, it justified the invocation of the power under section 13(2) for revoking or modifying the Order. Lastly, it was contended that in any view of the matter there was a material change in the relevant circumstances subsequent to the making of the Order dated 14th May, 1976 in that Hindustan Motor Ltd. started manufacturing and marketing competing utility vehicles since June 1976 and this was sufficient to warrant reconsideration of the Order under section 13 (2) . The respondents raised a preliminary objection against the maintainability of the appeal on the ground that under section 55 read with the newly substituted section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, an appeal could lie to this Court only on a substantial question of law and since the contentions raised on behalf of the appellant did not raise any substantial question of law, the appeal was not maintainable. The respondents also urged that on a proper construction of section 13(2) read with Regulation 85, the Commission could revoke or amend the Order dated 14th May, 1976 only if there was a material change in the relevant circumstances since the making of the Order or any of the grounds specified in Order XLVlI rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 was available to the appellant. The second and third grounds specified in Order XLVII, rule 1 obviously did not exist in the present case and the claim of the appellant for exercise of the power under section 13(2) could, if at all, rest only on the first ground, namely error of law apparent on the face of the record. But, said the respondents, there was no error of law apparent on the face of the record so far as the Order dated 14th May, 1976 was concerned, nor was there any material change in the relevant circumstances subsequent to the making of the order and hence section 13(2) was not attracted. The respondents contended that what the appellant was seeking to achieve by the application under section 13(2) was reconsideration of the Order dated 14th May, 1976 which was clearly impermissible, since section 13(2) could not be used as a substitute, for section 55 and that too, without the restrictive condition of that section. It was also urged on behalf of the respondents that, in any event the appellant was precluded from challenging the Order dated 14th May, 1976 by an application under Section 13(2) by reason of its subsequent conduct in acquiescing in the Order and unconditionally accepting the same. The appellant clearly waived the defects or infirmities if any in the Order dated 14th May, 1976 and was precluded from raising any contention against the validity of that Order. The respondents disputed validity of the contentions raised on behalf of the appellant and urged that in any event even if any of these defects or infirmities were present, they did not render the Order void as being without jurisdiction and hence the validity of the Order could not be challenged in the collateral proceedings under section 13(2). The respondents also contended that in any view of the matter the Order dated 14th May, 1976 was justified inasmuch as the trade practices complained of by the Registrar were restrictive trade practices. These were the rival contentions urged on behalf of the parties and we shall now proceed to examine The first question that arises for consideration in the preliminary objection of the respondents is as to what is the true scope and admit of an appeal under section 55. That section provides inter alia that any person aggrieved by an order made by the Commission under section 13 may prefer an appeal to this Court on &quot;one or more of the grounds specified in section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908&quot;. Now at the date when section 55 was enacted, namely, 27th December, 1969, being the date of coming into force of the Act, section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure specified three grounds on which a second appeal could be brought to the High Court and one of these grounds was that the decision appealed against was contrary to law. It was sufficient under section 100 as it stood then that there should be a question of law in order to attract the jurisdiction of the High Court in second appeal and, therefore, if the reference in section 55 were to the grounds set out in the then existing section 100, there can be no doubt that an appeal would lie to this Court under section 55 on a question of law. But subsequent to the enactment of section 55 section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure was substituted by a new section by section 37 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1976 with effect from 1st February, 1977 and the new section 100 provided that a second appeal shall lie to the High Court only if the High Court is satisfied that the case involves a substantial question of law. The three grounds on which a second appeal could lie under the former section 100 were abrogated and in their place only one ground was substituted which was a highly stringent ground, namely, that there should be a substantial question of law. This was the new section 100 which was in force on the date when the present appeal was preferred by the appellant and the argument of the respondents was that the maintainability of the appeal was, therefore, required to be judged by reference to the ground specified in the new section 100 and the appeal could be entertained only if there was a substantial question of law. The respondents leaned heavily on section 8(1) of the General Clauses Act, 1897 which provides:\r\n\r\n&quot;8(1) Where this Act, or any Central Act or Regulation made after the commencement of this Act, repeals and re-enacts, with or without modification, any provision of a former enactment, then references in any other enactment or in any instrument to the provision so repealed shall, un-\r\n\r\nless a different intention appears, be construed as references to the provision so re-enacted.&quot;\r\n\r\nand contended that the substitution of the new section 100 amounted to repeal and re-enactment of the former section 100 and, therefore, on an application of the rule of interpretation enacted in section 8(1), the reference in section 55 to section 100 must be construed as reference to the new section 100 and the appeal could be maintained only on the ground specified in the new section 100, that is, on a substantial question of law. We do not think this contention is well founded. It ignores the distinction between a mere reference to or citation of one statute in another and an incorporation which in effect means bodily lefting a provision of one enactment and making it a part of another. Where there is mere reference to or citation of one enactment in another without incorporation, section 8(1) applies and the repeal and re-enactment of the provision referred to or cited has the effect set out in that section and the reference to the provision repealed is required to be construed as reference to the provision as re-enacted. Such was the case in the Collector of Customs, Madras v. Nathella Sampathu Chetty &amp; Anr. and the New Central Jute Mills Co. Ltd. v. The Assistant Collector of Central Excise, Allahabad &amp; Ors. But where a provision of one statute is incorporated in another, the repeal or amendment of the former does not affect the latter. The effect of incorporation is as if the provision were written out in the incorporating statute and were a part of it. Legislation by incorporation is a common legislative device employed by the legislature, where the legislature for convenience of drafting incorporates provisions from an existing statute by reference to that statute instead of setting out for itself at length the provisions which it desires to adopt. Once the incorporation is made, the provision incorporated becomes an integral part of the statute in which it is transposed and thereafter there is no need to refer to the statute from which the incorporation is made and any subsequent amendment made in it has no effect on the incorporating statute. Lord Esher, M.R., while dealing with legislation in incorporation in In re. Wood&#39;s Estate (1886) 31 Ch.D. 607 pointed out at page 615:\r\n\r\n&quot;If a subsequent Act brings into itself by reference some of the clauses of a former Act, the legal effect of that, as has often been held, is to write those sections into the new Act.\r\n\r\njust as if they had been actually written in it with the pen, or printed in it, and, the moment you have those clauses in the later Act, you have no occasion to refer to the former Act at all.&quot;\r\n\r\nLord Justice Brett, also observed to the same effect in Clark v. Bradlaugh (1881) 8 Q.B.D. 63 at 69 :\r\n\r\n&quot; there is a rule of construction that, where a statute is incorporated by reference into a second statute, the repeal of the first statute by a third statute does no affect the second.&quot;\r\n\r\nThis was the rule applied by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Secretary of State for India in Council v. Hindustan Cooperative Insurance Society Ltd. The Judicial Committee pointed out in this case that the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 having been incorporated in the Calcutta Improvement Trust Act, 1911 and become an integral part of it, the subsequent amendment of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 by the addition of sub-section (2) in section 26 had no effect on the Calcutta Land Improvement Trust Act, 1911 and could not be read into it. Sir George Lowndes delivering the opinion of the Judicial Committee observed at page 267 :\r\n\r\n&quot;In this country it is accepted that where a statute is incorporated by reference into a second statute, the repeal of the first statute does not affect the second: see the cases collected in Craies on Statute Law, 3rd edn. pp. 349, 350.\r\n\r\n\r\n	  x		x	      x		     x\r\n	      x	   x   x    The independent existence of the\r\n\r\n\r\ntwo Acts is, therefore, recognized; despite the death of the parent Act, its offspring survives in the incorporating Act. x x x It seems to be no less logical to hold that where certain provisions from an existing Act have been incorporated into a subsequent Act, no addition to the former Act, which is not expressly made applicable to the subsequent Act, can be deemed to be incorporated in it, at all events if it is possible for the subsequent Act to function effectually without the addition.&quot;\r\n\r\nSo also in Ramswarup v. Munshi &amp; Ors., it was held by this Court that since the definition of &quot;agricultural land&#39; in the Punjab Alienation of Land Act, 1900 was bodily incorporated in the Punjab Pre-emption Act, 1913, the repeal of the former Act had no effect on the continued operation of the latter. Rajagopala Ayyangar, J., speaking for the Court observed at pages 868- 869 of the Report:\r\n\r\n&quot;Where the provisions of an Act are incorporated by reference in a later Act the repeal of the earlier Act has, in general, no effect upon the construction or effect of the Act in which its provisions have been incorporated.\r\n\r\nx x x x In the circumstances, therefore, the repeal of the Punjab Alienation of Land Act of 1900 has no effect on the continued operation of the Pre-emption Act and the expression &#39;agricultural land&#39; in the latter Act has to be read as if the definition in the Alienation of Land Act had been bodily transposed into it.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe decision of this Court in Bolani Ores Ltd. v. State of Orissa also proceeded on the same principle. There the question arose in regard to the\r\n Area 10(a) (iii) of the Monopolies and Restrictive Exchange Practices Act, 1969 empowers the Monopolies and Prohibitive Trade Practices Commission to enquire into any prohibitive exchange hones upon an application made to it by the Registrar of Restrictive Trade Agreements. Segment 13(2) gives that &quot;any request made by the Commission might be revised or repudiated whenever in the way in which it was made.&quot; Section 55 gives that any individual distressed by an arrange made by the Central Government or the Commission under s. 13 or s. 37 may incline toward an interest to the Supreme Court on one or more of the grounds determined in s. 100, Code of Common Procedure, 1908. On the date on which the Act came into drive s. 100 C.P.C. indicated three grounds on which a moment bid could mislead the High Court one of them being that the choice claimed against was opposite to law. By an correction made in 1976 s.100 was substituted by a new segment which gives that a moment bid should deceive the High Court just if the High Court is fulfilled that the case includes a considerable question of law. The appealing party, who was a producer of jeep engine vehicles, their save parts and embellishments, submitted for enrollment to the Registrar of Restrictive Trade Understandings, standard distributorship assentions went into by it with its merchants. After registering the understandings, in his application to the Commission, the Enlistment center charged that certain conditions in the assention identified with prohibitive exchange rehearses and that some of them were biased to open intrigue. The litigant, in answer to the Commission&#39;s notice, expressed that it didn&#39;t wish to be heard in the procedures prior to the Commission, bringing up while there was nothing in the decried provisions of the understanding which could be said to constitute prohibitive exchange hones the reasons whereof had as of now been clarified in its answer. 1039 The Registrar documented before the Commission a testimony in support of his application yet that too did not contain any further or extra material than what was set out in his application. No other confirmation, oral or narrative, was delivered by him before the Commission in support of the affirmation that the agreement constituted a prohibitive exchange rehearse. By its request dated May 14, 1976 the Commission pronounced certain provisions of the litigant&#39;s distributorship assention to be void. While correspondence was going on between the Enlistment center and the litigant on the accommodation of a changed distributorship understanding, this Court in Tata Engineering and Train Co. Ltd. v. Enlistment center of Restrictive Trade Rehearses, [1977] 2 SCR 685 gave its understanding on the pertinent arrangements of the Act. Immediately the appealing party made an application to the Commission calling attention to that it did not challenge the enquiry procedures under s. 37 in the first occasion in light of the fact that the Commission&#39;s choice in the Telco case was specifically pertinent; yet now that that choice had been turned around by the Supreme Court in request, its request dated May 14, 1976 required correction/change. An application under s. 13 (2) read with control 85 was in like manner made for denial, correction or modification of the Commission&#39;s request of May 14, 1976. The Commission rejected this application by a request dated 28th February 1978. In its allure under s. 55 of the Act impugning the Commission&#39;s request dated 28th February 1978 the appealing party battled that (1) the Registrar&#39;s application claiming prohibitive exchange hones did not set out any actualities demonstrating how the litigant&#39;s exchange practices were prohibitive in nature and that the Registrar&#39;s application not having been made as per the law set around this Court in Telco case the denounced arrange of the Commission was subject to be denied or adjusted under s. 13(2); (2) the request did not give any purposes behind its choice as was vitiated; and (3) the order was a proceeding with request in light of the fact that it required the appealing party not merely to stop but also cease from the prohibitive exchange rehearses set out in the arrange and was, in this way required to be persistently reasonable and since it was, in opposition to the law set down in Telco case it was at risk to be repudiated or revised; in any occasion the choice of this Court being ensuing to the making of the Commission&#39;s order, there was sufficient legitimization for repudiating or modifying the request under s. 13(2) of the Act. The respondent, then again, battled that (1) on a use of the control of understanding authorized in s. 8(1) or the General Clauses Act, reference in s. 55 to s. 100 C.P.C. must be understood as a kind of perspective to the new s. 100, C.P.C. thus understood an interest to the Supreme Court would lie just if the case included &quot;a considerable question of law&quot; and not generally and since for this situation no such question was included, the interest was not viable; (2) s. 13(2) couldn&#39;t be utilized by the litigant as a substitute for s. 55; and (3) by reason of its consequent lead in assenting in the Commission&#39;s request and genuinely tolerating it, the litigant was blocked from raising any dispute against its legitimacy in offer to this Court. Permitting the interest, ^ HELD: The appeal is viable under s. 55 of the Act. [1064 C] 1(a) On a legitimate understanding of s. 55 it must be held that the grounds speci- 1040 fied in the then existing s. 100 CPC were joined in s. 55 and the substitution of the new s. 100 did not influence or confine the grounds as joined in s. 55. In any occasion, the present interest brings up generous issues of law, and so is viable. [1064 C] (b) There is a refinement between a unimportant reference to then again reference of one statute in another and a consolidation. Where there is a minor reference to or reference of one establishment in another without consolidation, s. 8(1) of the General Clause Act applies and the annulment and re-order of the arrangement alluded to or refered to has the impact set out in that area and the reference to the arrangement canceled is required to be interpreted as reference to the arrangement as re-established. In any case, where a provision of one statute is consolidated in another, the annulment or revision of the former does not influence the last mentioned. The effect of consolidation is as though the arrangement incorporated were worked out in the incorporting statute and were a piece of it. Once the consolidation is made, the arrangement joined turns into an indispensable part of the statute in which it is transposed and thereafter there is no compelling reason to allude to the statute from which the consolidation is made and any resulting change made in it has no impact on the consolidating statute.

','Shamkant Narayan Despande Vs Maharashtra Industrial CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Special Leave petition (c) No.\n4748 of 1991.\nFrom the Judgment and Order dated 21.1.91 of the Bombay High\nCourt in W.P. No. 3481 of 1990.\nN.B. Shetye,  P.M.  Pradhan  and  A.M.	khanwilkar  for	 the\npetitioner.\nDushyant Dave, Beliram Vakil, Abrar Ali, Ajit Yogi, Gajender\nLal, Mukul Gupta and Ms. Sonia Khan for the Respondents.\nThe Judgment of the court was delivered by\n     SAWANT,  J.   The	petitioner  is	diploma-  holder  in\nEngineering  and holds the post of Executive Engineer in the\nrespondent-Corporation. Till 1974, the promotion post of the\nsuperintending Engineer	 was  available	 both  for  diploma-\nholders and degree-holders according to merit-cum-seniority.\nThis was  so according	to  the	 practice  followed  by	 the\nCorporation without  making any	 rules or regulation in that\nbehalf. In  1974, the corporation made regulation by passing\na resolution  by passing a resolution and continued the same\npractice. Admittedly,  the regulation  were not	 made  under\nsection 64  of the  Maharashtra Industrial  Development Act,\n1961 [hereinafter  referred to as the &apos;Act&apos;] under which the\nrespondent-corporation was  created. Thereafter in 1988, the\ncorporation passed a resolution, for the first time,. making\n75 per	cent of	   the	posts  of  superintending  engineers\navailable to  the executive Engineers holding degrees and 25\nper cent  to  the  Executive  Engineers	 who  were  diploma-\nholders.  This	 resolution  was   also	 admittedly   not  a\nregulation made	 under the   said  section 64.	But for this\nresolution, the	 petitioner who was senior to respondent NO.\n2 would	 have been  promoted to	 the post  of Superintending\nEngineer on  31st October,  1990. However,  since respondent\nNo.2 was a degree holder, he got the said resolution and was\npromoted to the said post on that date. It is this promotion\nwhich was challenged by the petitioner by a writ petition in\nthe High  Court. The  High Court  by the  impugned  judgment\ndismissed the said petition.\n     2.	 Two   contentions  were  raised\n     before us.\n     (i) that no classification could be\n     made among	 the Executive Engineers\n     on the  basis of  their educational\n     qualification for	the  purpose  of\n     promotion	 to    the    post    of\n     superintending Engineer, since they\n     belong  to	  the  same   cadre   of\n     Executive Engineers and do the same\n     work.  There   was	 also  a  common\n     seniority	  of	the    Executive\n     Engineers	maintained.   hence  the\n     classification  was  discriminatory\n     in nature and violative of Articles\n     14 and 16 of the Constitution .\n     (ii)  that	  if  at   all	such   a\n     discrimination was	 permissible, it\n     could be  made only  be a statutory\n     rule  or  regulation  framed  under\n     Section 64	 of the said Act. A mere\n     resolution	   or	 an    executive\n     instruction could	not effect  such\n     discrimination.\n3.   We find  not merit in either of the two contentions. It\nis now	well settled  that for	the purpose  of promotion, a\nvalid classification  can made among the members holding the\nsame post  on the  basis of their qualification. In state of\nJummu &amp;	 Kashmir v.  Triloki Nath Khosa &amp; Ors., [1974] 1 SCR\n771, a Constitution Bench of his court has clearly held that\nsuch a	classification is  permissible and  does not violate\nArticles 14  and  16  of  the  Constitution  the  Court	 has\nobserved there that in state of Mysore &amp; Anr. v. P. Narasing\nRao, [1968]  1 SCR  407 and The Union of India and others v.\nDr.(Mrs.) S.B.	Kholi, AIR  1973 SC 811, it was already held\nthat   classification	 on   the   basis   of	 educational\nqualification was  permissible. The  Court then	 referred to\nRoshan Lal  Tandon v.  Union of India, [1968] 1 SCR  185 and\ndistinguished it  on the facts by pointing out that it was a\ncase of	 the direct  recruits and  promotees integrated into\none cadre.  Once they  were integrated they lost their birth\nbirth-marks, viz.  the different   sources  from which	they\nwere recruited.	 [Emphasis supplied].  The court pointed out\nthat Roshan Lal&apos;s case [supra] was thus no authority for the\nproposition that  if direct  recruits  and    promotees	 are\nintegrated into	 one class  they cannot	 be  classified	 for\npurposed of promotion on a basis other than that in the case\nbefore the them the classified for purpose of promotion on a\nbasis  other  than  that  they	were  drawn  from  different\nsources. The  court also  pointed out  that the	 very  Bench\nwhich decided  Roshan Lal&apos;s    case  [supra]  he Constitution of India, Art.14, Art.16 - Promotion to post of Superintending Engineer - Classification of degree-holder and confirmation holder Executive Engineers - Not violative Arts. 14 and 16. \r\n\r\nMaharashtra Industrial Development Act (3 of 1962), S.64. \r\n\r\nAIR 1983 SC 881, Held per incuriam. \r\n\r\nAIR 1974 SC 1, Foll. \r\n\r\nAdvancement - Classification among same class on premise of capabilities - Permissible. \r\n\r\nMaharashtra Industrial Development Act (3 of 1962), S.63 - Promotion to post of Superintending Engineer - Classification of degree holder and confirmation holder Executive Engineers - Made by Corporation by passing simple determination - Not illicit. \r\n\r\nAuthoritative law - Change in administration condition by passing simple determination - allowable. \r\n\r\nStates of Service - Can be changed by official guidelines.\r\n\r\nheld: The proposition that in the absence of the rules and regulations, the authority can act by executive instruction finds direct support in Mysore state Road Transport Corporation v. Gopinath Gundachar char, {1968] 1 SCR 767 and v. Balasubramaniam and others v. Tamil Nadu housing Board and others, [1987] 4 SCC 738.\r\n\r\nIn view of the above, the petition stands dismissed.

Inasmuch as the issue of remaining land of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n143   bighas   raised   by   the   respondents   is   pending   before   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nRevenue   Minister,   the   same   is   not   relevant   for   our   present \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(5)    It   is   the   contention   of   the   learned   counsel   for   the   State \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   the   order   dated   23.04.1969   about   the   grant   of   603.16 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbighas of land (including 460.15 bighas - the subject matter of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npresent proceedings) was ex facie without jurisdiction as it was \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nallotted   by   the  PHED  on  flimsy   and  fallacious   grounds  about \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncancellation   of   patta   way   back   in   the   year   1942   and   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompensation sought in the year 1968.   It is relevant to note \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat the same was cancelled way back in 1973.   Inasmuch as \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopportunity of hearing was not given, the learned single Judge \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof the High Court, by order dated 24.11.1976, remanded back \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto the State Government for     deciding the matter afresh after \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngiving due opportunity of hearing to the respondents herein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(6)    On   behalf   of   the   State,   it   was   pointed   out   that   it   has \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlegitimate   grievance   with   the   allotment   dated   23.04.1969   by \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  PHED.     The cancellation was made way back in the year \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1942   for   allotment   made   in   the   year   1941   on   the   ground   of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nviolation   of   lease   conditions.     The   respondents   have   claimed \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhuge   compensation   for   construction   said   to   have   been   made \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nduring   subsistence   of   lease   in   the   year   1949   itself   and   filed \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplication for compensation with regard to the cancellation of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npatta   in   the   year   1968.     According   to   the   State,   the   said \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplication   was   barred   by   limitation   and   it   was   also   filed \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbefore wrong forum, i.e., the PHED, when it should have been \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfiled   before   the   Land   Revenue   Department,   which   is   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappropriate Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(7)    It   is   also   the   grievance   of   the   State   that   the   allotment \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndated 23.04.1969  was cancelled on 01.05.1973,  however, the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHigh   Court   set   aside   the   same   on   24.11.1976   on   the   limited \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nground that there was violation of natural justice and directed \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   State   Government   to   decide   it   afresh   after   giving \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopportunity   of   hearing.     In   those   circumstances,   the   State \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwants to exercise its power under the Land Revenue Act read \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith the orders passed by the learned single Judge of the High \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCourt   dated   24.11.1976   and   the   Revenue   Minister   dated \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15.12.1992.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(8)    It   was   highlighted   that   the   judgment   of   the   trial   Court \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndated 30.06.1982 is also nullity since there was no discussion \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non   merits   with   regard   to   the   validity   of   allotment   dated \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n23.04.1969. Though it was pointed out by the counsel for the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrespondents that it was hit by the principle of  res judicata  as \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclarified by the counsel for the appellants, the principle of  res  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njudicata shall only apply if there is discussion or finding on the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsame   subject   matter.     A   perusal   of   the   decree   of   injunction \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   had   been   passed   on   23.04.1969   shows   that   it   did   not \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadvert to the merits of the case at all.  It is also not in dispute \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   the   subject   Property - Notice for reviewing - Objections against the notice for reviewing the request permitted by High Court - Hence, introduce claim - Held, arrive being referred to has a place with the Revenue Department of the State of Rajasthan and the PHED had no purview at all to reestablish 460.15 bighas of land for the Respondents - It was unnecessary to specify that while passing crisp requests as coordinated, the State Government needed to issue notice to every one of the gatherings concerned and choose the same as per law - Appeals permitted. Appeals Allowed','Dahyabhai Ranchhoddas Dhobi &amp; Anr Vs State Of Gujarat &amp; Ors P. Sathasivam, J.\n\n1) Leave granted.\n\n2) This appeal is directed against the judgment and order\n\ndated 12.01.2009 passed by the High Court of Gujarat at\n\nAhmedabad in Special Civil Application No. 5663 of 1990\n\nwith Civil Application No. 3458 of 2006 whereby the High\n\nCourt dismissed the petition preferred by the appellants\n\nherein.\n\n\n\n\n \n3) Brief facts:\n\na)   According to the appellants, they are owners of the\n\nland in question measuring 848.66 sq.m., Nandh No.\n\n2190/P, Ward No.4 of Surat City.        The State of Gujarat\n\ninitiated   acquisition   proceedings    under   the   Land\n\nAcquisition Act, 1894 (hereinafter referred to as the \"Act\")\n\nfor construction of a school in the land in question under\n\nthe Surat Municipal Corporation. The appellants objected\n\nto the said acquisition on the ground that:\n\n(i) this is the only land for them for carrying on the\n\nbusiness of washermen and they are using this land for\n\nthe purpose of their livelihood.\n\n(ii) There are vacant/open lands adjoining to the land in\n\nquestion.\n\n(iii) Within a radius of 1 km., number of schools are\n\navailable particularly being run by the Surat Municipal\n\nCorporation.\n\n\n\n\n \n(iv) While acquiring the land, the respondents have not\n\nfollowed the provisions of Sections 4, 5, 6 and 11A of the\n\nAct.\n\nb)     On the other hand, it is the stand of the State\n\nGovernment that:\n\n(i) the land is required for establishing a primary school by\n\nthe Surat Municipal Corporation.\n\n(ii) They fully complied with the statutory notices and\n\nother requirements.\n\n(iii) The appellants did not avail the opportunity of\n\nparticipating in the 5A enquiry by filing objections.\n\n(iv) The declaration made under Section 6 of the Act is\n\nwithin time.\n\n(v) Award under Section 11A has been passed within the\n\nstatutory period. Since the establishment of school is for\n\na public purpose and in view of compliance of all the\n\nstatutory formalities, there is no merit in the appeal and\n\nprayed for dismissal of the same.\n\n\n\n\n \n4)   Heard Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel for\n\nthe appellants and Mr. Prashant G. Desai, learned senior\n\ncounsel for the Surat Municipal Corporation and Ms.\n\nHemantika Wahi, learned counsel for the State of Gujarat.\n\n5)   Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel for the\n\nappellants has raised the following contentions:\n\na)   there was no hearing/enquiry in terms of Section 5A\n\nof the Act which is mandatory;\n\nb)   the locality publication was not effected under\n\nSection 6(2);\n\nc)   the Award passed under Section 11A was not made\n\nwithin two years from the date of last publication of\n\nnotification under Section 6, therefore the acquisition is\n\nvitiated;\n\nd)   after change of classification of the land in question,\n\nnamely, residential use, the respondents are not permitted\n\nto establish a primary school which is not permissible;\n\ne)   In view of the fact that the area being designated as\n\nresidential congested by houses on either side, it is not a\n\n \nfit place for establishing a school as observed by this\n\nCourt in Avinash Mehrotra vs. Union of India and\n\nOthers, (2009) 6 SCC 398.\n\n6)   On the other hand, Mr. Prashant G. Desai, learned\n\nsenior counsel for the Surat Municipal Corporation has\n\nsubmitted that in view of Section 12 (2) (b) and Section 20\n\n(1) of the Gujarat Town Planning &amp; Urban Development\n\nAct, 1976, the State Government is well within their\n\npowers in establishing a primary school in Surat.       He\n\nfurther submitted that all the statutory provisions have\n\nbeen strictly complied with and the declaration under\n\nSection 6 and Award under Section 11A were duly made\n\nwithin the prescribed time. Ms. Hemantika Wahi, learned\n\ncounsel appearing for the State, by drawing our attention\n\nto specific averments in the counter affidavit submitted\n\nthat the appellants having not filed objections in the\n\nenquiry under Section 5A, all the three modes of\n\npublication as contemplated under Section 6 were duly\n\npublished and made and Award passed within the\n\n \nprescribed period, there is no infirmity in the acquisition\n\nproceedings and prayed for dismissal of the appeal.\n\n7)   We    have    considered     the   rival   contentions   and\n\nperused the relevant materials.\n\n8)   With regard to the first objection as to enquiry under\n\nSection 5A of the Act though the appellants have stated\n\nthat they were not given an opportunity of being heard, in\n\nthe counter affidavit filed by the Special Land Acquisition\n\nOfficer,   Surat   before   the   High    Court    it   has   been\n\nspecifically asserted that notification under Section 4 in\n\nthe Official Gazette was published on 09.03.1989, public\n\nnotice displayed at the office of Mamlatdar of the\n\nconcerned Ward on 20.04.1989 and hearing of objections\n\nunder Section 5A was fixed on 20.05.1989. In para 4 of\n\nthe counter affidavit, the Land Acquisition Officer has\n\nspecifically stated that appellants were given several\n\nopportunities for hearing their objections from time to\n\ntime. The hearing was fixed on 29.05.1989, 05.06.1989,\n\n12.06.1989, 20.09.1989, 28.09.1989 and 16.10.1989 and\n\n \nthe appellants were heard through their lawyer Mr.\n\nKashyap H. Shukla.           In view of the above specific\n\ninformation the contention contrary to the same is liable\n\nto be rejected.\n\n9)   The second objection is that locality publication was\n\nnot effected under Section 6(2) of the Act.       In the same\n\ncounter   affidavit,   the   Land   Acquisition   Officer   has\n\nasserted that publication of notification under Section 6\n\nwas published in the Gazette dated 21.03.1990.          Public\n\nNotice displayed at the office of Mamlatdar of the\n\nconcerned Ward on 19.04.1990. In the light of the said\n\ninformation, the claim that no publication of notice in the\n\nlocality under Section 6(2) cannot be accepted.\n\n10) The third and the important objection relates to\n\npassing of Award under Section 11A. It is the stand of the\n\nappellants that Award was not made within two years\n\nfrom the date of last publication of Notification under\n\nSection 6 hence the acquisition is vitiated.      Since heavy\n\nreliance was placed on the said objection, it is useful to\n\n \nrefer Section 6 and Section 11A of the Act which reads\n\nthus:\n\n    \"6. Declaration that land is required for a public\n    purpose.- (1) Subject to the provision of Part VII of this Act,\n    when the appropriate Government is satisfied, after\n    considering the report, if any, made under section 5A, sub-\n    section (2), that any particular land is needed for a public\n    purpose, or for a Company, a declaration shall be made to\n    that effect under the signature of a Secretary to such\n    Government or of some officer duly authorized to certify its\n    orders and different declarations may be made from time to\n    time in respect of different parcels of any land covered by the\n    same notification under section 4, sub-section (1)\n    irrespective of whether one report or different reports has or\n    have been made (wherever required) under section 5A, sub-\n    section (2);\n\n    Provided that no declaration in respect of any particular\n    land covered by a notification under section 4, sub-section\n    (1)-\n\n    (i) published after the commencement of the Land\n    Acquisition (Amendment and Validation) Ordinance, 1967 (1\n    of 1967), but before the commencement of the Land\n    Acquisition (Amendment) Act, 1984 shall be made after the\n    expiry of three years from the date of the publication of the\n    notification; or\n\n    (ii) published after the commencement of the Land\n    Acquisition (Amendment) Act, 1984 shall be made after the\n    expiry of one year from the date of the publication of the\n    notification:\n\n    Provided further that no such declaration shall be made\n    unless the compensation to be awarded for such property is\n    to be paid by a Company, or wholly or partly out of public\n    revenues or some fund controlled or managed by a local\n    authority.\n\n    Explanation 1. - In computing any of the periods referred to\n    in the first proviso, the period during which any action or\n    proceeding to be taken in pursuance of the notification\n    issued under section 4, sub-section (1), is stayed by an order\n\n\n \nof a Court shall be excluded.\n\nExplanation 2. - Where the compensation to be awarded for\nsuch property is to be paid out of the funds of a corporation\nowned or controlled by the State, such compensation shall\nbe deemed to be compensation paid out of public revenues.\n\n(2) Every declaration shall be published in the Official\nGazette, and in two daily newspapers circulating in the\nlocality in which the land is situated of which at least one\nshall be in the regional language, and the Collector shall\ncause public notice of the substance of such declaration to\nbe given at convenient places in the said locality (the last of\nthe dates of such publication and the giving of such public\nnotice, being hereinafter referred to as the date of the\npublication of the declaration), and such declaration shall\nstate the district or other territorial division in which the\nland is situate, the purpose for which it is needed, its\napproximate area, and, where a plan shall have been made\nof the land, the place where such plan may be inspected.\n\n(3) The said declaration shall be conclusive evidence that the\nland is needed for a public purpose or for a company, as the\ncase may be; and, after making such declaration, the\nappropriate Government may acquire the land in manner\nhereinafter appearing.\n\n11A. Period within which an award shall be made.- (1) The\nCollector shall make an award under section 11 within a\nperiod of two years from the date of the publication of the\ndeclaration and if no award is made within that period, the\nentire proceeding for the acquisition of the land shall lapse:\n\nProvided that in a case where the said declaration has been\npublished before the commencement of the Land Acquisition\n(Amendment) Act, 1984, the award shall be made within a\nperiod of two years from such commencement.\n\nExplanation - In computing the period of two years referred\nto in this section, the period during which any action or\nproceeding to be taken in pursuance of the said declaration\nis stayed by an order of a Court shall be excluded.\"\n\n\n\n\n \n11) These provisions were considered by this Court in\n\nvarious decisions.       In Krishi Utpadan Mandi Samiti\n\nand Another vs. Makrand Singh and Others, (1995) 2\n\nSCC 497, the question that was posed for consideration\n\nwas whether the High Court was right in its conclusion\n\nthat the declaration under Section 6 was published after\n\nthree years and the last of the publications shall be the\n\nlast date for the purpose of computing three years&apos; period\n\nenvisaged in clause (i) of the proviso to sub-section (1) of\n\nSection 6 of the Act as amended by Land Acquisition\n\n(Amendment) Act, 1984. The discussion and conclusion\n\nin paras 4 and 5 are relevant:\n\n     \"4. The question, therefore, is that which date of the\n     publications in three steps i.e. publication in the Gazette,\n     two newspapers and local publication to be the last date for\n     the purpose of computing three years&apos; limitation prescribed\n     in clause (i) of the proviso to Section 6(1) of the Act. Prima\n     facie, it gives an impression that the last of any of the three\n     steps puts in motion, the running of limitation of three\n     years. But on deeper probe, it does not appear to be so and\n     such a construction would easily defeat the public purpose\n     and deflects the course of justice. So it is necessary to\n     understand the scheme and policy of the Act to get the crux\n     of the question. It is seen that sub-section (1) of Section 4\n     gives power of eminent domain to the State to acquire the\n     land, whenever it appears to it that the land is needed or\n     likely to be needed for any public purpose or for any\n     company, by a notification published in the Official Gazette\n\n\n \nand two daily newspapers circulating in that area and at\nleast one of them should be in the regional language and\nalso the Collector is enjoined to cause public notice of the\nsubstance of notification to be given at convenient places in\nthe said locality in which the land is situated. It is also\nmentioned thereunder that the last date of such publication\nand the giving of such public notice \"being hereinafter\nreferred to\" as the date of publication of the notification. It\nwould be seen that the purpose of notification under Section\n4(1) is an intimation to the owner or person having an\ninterest in the land that Government exercised the power of\neminent domain in relation to his land and for public\npurpose his land is needed or likely to be needed; puts an\nembargo on his freedom to deal with the land as an\nunencumbered land and also pegs the price of the land\nprevailing as on that date. It also is a caveat to the Collector\nto make the award under Section 11 as well as to determine\nthe market value prevailing as on the last of the dates to be\nthe date and the award should be made within a period\nprescribed by Section 11-A, lest the entire acquisition shall\nstand lapsed. The word `hereinafter&apos; is for such purposes as\nwell as for the purpose of determination of the compensation\nunder Chapter III of the Act as well. Therefore, the word\n`hereinafter&apos; referred to as the last date of the publication of\nthe notification is the date from which the prevailing prices\nof the land is to be computed etc.\n\n\n5. Clause (i) of the proviso to Section 6(1) mandates the\npublication of the declaration in the Official Gazette and it\nshould be within three years from the date of the publication\nof the notification under Section 4(1) i.e. the last of the dates\nreferred to in Section 4(1). The word `publish&apos; emphasises the\nact accomplished i.e. declaration under Section 6(1) being\npublished in the Official Gazette. The last date under Section\n6(2) shall be the date for the purposes \"hereinafter referred\nto\" would be not for computing the period of three years\nprescribed in clause (i) of proviso to Section 6(1) of the Act as\nit was already done, but purposes to be followed hereinafter.\nOtherwise language would have been \"hereinbefore done\".\nSub-section (2) as such did not prescribe any limitation\nwithin which the declaration under Section 6(1) or other\nsteps hereinafter to be taken, in other words, the steps to be\ntaken thereafter in making the award under Section 11 or in\ncomputation of the period prescribed in Section 11-A. The\npublication of the declaration in two daily newspapers\nhaving circulation in the locality one of which is in the\nregional language and the publication of the substance of\n\n\n \n    the declaration in the locality are ministerial acts and is a\n    procedural part. It appears that these publications are\n    required to be done to make the declaration published in the\n    manner, to be conclusive evidence of the public purpose\n    under Section 6(1) and also to provide limitation to make the\n    award under Section 11 by the Collector. In other words, the\n    limitation prescribed under Section 11-A is for the purpose\n    of making the award and if the Collector fails to do so, the\n    entire proceeds under Sections 4(1) and 6(1) shall stand\n    lapsed. If this consistent policy of the Act is understood\n    giving teeth to the operational efficacy to the scheme of the\n    Act and public purpose the Act seeks to serve, we are of the\n    considered view that publication in the Official Gazette\n    already made under clause (i) of proviso to sub-section (1) of\n    Section 6 is complete, as soon as the declaration under\n    Section 6(1) was published in the Official Gazette. That will\n    be the date for the purpose of computation of three years&apos;\n    period from the last of the dates of the publication of the\n    notification under Section 4(1). The procedural ministerial\n    acts prescribed under sub-section (2) are only for the\n    purpose of the procedure to be followed `hereinafter&apos;, in other\n    words, the steps to be taken subsequent to the publication of\n    the declaration under Section 6(1) of t Property - Validity of securing procedures - Sections 4, 5A, 6, 6 and 11A Land Acquisition Act, 1894 - Acquisition procedures were started under the Land Acquisition Act for development of a school on the land under the Surat Municipal Corporation - Appellants the proprietors, tested the obtaining on grounds procurement not done according to arrangements set down under the Act and honor was not made inside two years from the date of last production of Notification under Section 6 subsequently, the obtaining is vitiated - High Court rejected the request of favored by the Appellants - Hence exhibit Appeal — Whether High court was supported in expelling the appeal to favored by the Appellants - Held, notice under Section 4 in the Official Gazette was distributed, open notice was shown at the workplace of Mamlatdar of the concerned Ward and knowing about protests under Section 5A was additionally settled and the Appellants were given a few open doors for hearing their complaints now and again — Notification under Section 6 was keep going distributed on nineteenth April, 1990 and in this manner the time of two years stipulated in Section 11A would start to keep running from nineteenth April, 1990 and, along these lines, the distribution of the Award under Section 11 of the Act on eighteenth April, 1992 was inside the stipulated time point of confinement of two years - Land being referred to kept under booking for school in the endorsed improvement anticipate the State Government under Section 17 of the Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Act, it is the obligation of the Corporation to gain the land for actualizing the arrangements of the same - No Interference with the Order of High court - Appeal expelled \r\n\r\nProperty - \"Need\" and \"need\" - Appellant fought that in perspective of presence of many schools in and around the region, there is no compelling reason to build up a school in the place that is known for the Appellants - Held, In regard of \"need\" and \"need\", it is for the Government and their specialists to take a choice considering different angles - If such a choice is taken in view of materials it is not for the Court to question their case - Appeal expelled ','Arjun Singh Vs State Of H.P Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.\n\n\n\n\n1.

He\nwas sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 7 years, 3 years, 4\n\nyears, 5 years and 7 years for the aforesaid offences alongwith fine with\n\ndefault stipulation.\n\n\n\n3.    Prosecution version as unfolded during trial is as follows:\n\n\n\n      On 18.7.1999, the victim (PW10) boarded the bus to Shimla from\n\nSolan. When the bus bearing registration No. HP-12-4113 reached near\n\npetrol pump (HIMFED) situated near Nav Bahar towards Chotta Shimla, all\n\nthe passengers got down, except the prosecutrix and accused-appellant\n\nArjun Singh. Accused Arjun Singh committed forcible sexual intercourse\n\nwith the prosecutrix against her will and without her consent. The victim\n\nwas kidnapped by the accused who was minor at the time of kidnapping in\n\nbus No.HP-12-4113 from Solan. The accused had induced the prosecutrix\n\nthat he would marry her after reaching Nalagarh. The FIR was registered.\n\nThereafter the investigation was carried out and the challan was put in the\n\nCourt. The appellant was charged for offences punishable under Sections\n\n376, 511, 366 and 109 of the Indian Penal Code. The prosecution examined\n\n15 witnesses to prove its case. The appellant had examined Shri Arvind\n\nSharma (DW 1) as defence witness. The learned Additional Sessions Judge,\n\n\n\n \nSolan, convicted and sentenced the accused as stated above. The sentences\n\nwere directed to run concurrently. It is to be noted that two persons faced\n\ntrial for the aforesaid offences i.e. appellant who was the conductor of the\n\nvehicle, and one Daler Singh who was the driver of the vehicle. Since\n\naccused persons abjured guilt, trial was held. The trial court placed reliance\n\non the evidence of the prosecutrix (PW1) and her mother (PW 3). As a plea\n\nrelating to the age of the prosecutrix to show that she was a consenting party\n\nwas taken, the person who had issued the date of birth certificate was\n\nexamined as PW 4. According to the said certificate the date of birth was\n\n19th October, 1984. She was admitted to the school on 1st April, 1997 and\n\nhad left it on 24th October, 1998. The trial Court held that the age of the\n\nvictim was less than 16 years and placed reliance on the documents\n\nproduced. It was also submitted by the accused persons that no rape has\n\nbeen committed. This plea also was rejected by the trial court.\n\n\n\n      Accordingly the trial court while holding the appellant guilty,\n\nacquitted co-accused. As noted above, appeal before the High Court was\n\ndismissed.\n\n\n\n\n \n4.    In support of the appeal the stand taken before the trial court and the\n\nHigh Court were reiterated.\n\n\n\n5.    Learned counsel for the respondent-State supported the judgment of\n\nthe High Court.\n\n\n\n6.    So far as the age aspect is concerned in Vishnu v. State of\n\nMaharashtra [2006(1) SCC 283] it was inter alia held as follows:\n\n\n                \"20. It is urged before us by Mr Lalit that the\n             determination of the age of the prosecutrix by\n             conducting ossification test is scientifically proved and,\n             therefore, the opinion of the doctor that the girl was of\n             18-19 years of age should be accepted. We are unable to\n             accept this contention for the reasons that the expert\n             medical evidence is not binding on the ocular evidence.\n             The opinion of the Medical Officer is to assist the court\n             as he is not a witness of fact and the evidence given by\n             the Medical Officer is really of an advisory character and\n             not binding on the witness of fact.\"\n\n\n\n\n7.    In State of Chhattisgarh v. Lekhram [2006(5) SCC 736] it was held\n\nthat the register maintained in a school is admissible evidence to prove the\n\ndate of birth of the person concerned in terms of Section 35 of the Indian\n\nEvidence Act, 1872 (in short `Evidence Act&apos;). It may be true that in the\n\nentry of the school register is not conclusive but it has evidentiary value.\n\n \n8.    Learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that the evidence of\n\nthe Doctor clearly rules out the commission of rape. The Medical officer\n\n(PW 9) has stated that rape had not been committed and sexual intercourse\n\nhad not taken place.\n\n\n\n9.    The offence of rape occurs in Chapter XVI of IPC. It is an offence\n\naffecting the human body. In that Chapter, there is a separate heading for\n\n`Sexual offence&apos;, which encompasses Sections 375, 376, 376-A, 376-B,\n\n376-C, and 376-D. `Rape&apos; is defined in Section 375. Sections 375 and 376\n\nhave been substantially changed by Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1983,\n\nand several new sections were introduced by the new Act, i.e. 376-A, 376-\n\nB, 376-C and 376-D. The fact that sweeping changes were introduced\n\nreflects the legislative intent to curb with iron hand, the offence of rape\n\nwhich affects the dignity of a woman. The offence of rape in its simplest\n\nterm is `the ravishment of a woman, without her consent, by force, fear or\n\nfraud&apos;, or as `the carnal knowledge of a woman by force against her will&apos;.\n\n`Rape&apos; or `Raptus&apos; is when a man hath carnal knowledge of a w (1) Indian Penal Code, 1860 - Sections 376, 511, 365, 366 and 109- - Rape, and so forth.- - Conviction and sentence - Whether subject to obstruction?- - Held, \"halfway\"- - Rape does not seem to have been conferred - But rather endeavor to submit assault - Clearly settled - Hence, offense under Section 376 not made out- - But rather that under Section 511 obviously made out- - In foundation of certainties of case, Section 109 has no application - Appellant properly indicted and sentenced for offenses under Sections 365, 366 and 511- - But his conviction under Sections 109 and 376 unsustainable- - But put aside. \r\n\r\n(2) Evidence Act, 1872- - Sections 3 and 9- - Appreciation of proof - Evidence of therapeutic officer on age- - Really of counseling character- - And not official on observer of actuality. ','Karnataka Industrial Areas Vs Nandi Cold Storage Pvt. Ltd J U D G M E N T I.A. NO.1 IN CIVIL APPEAL NO. 5542 OF 2004 Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.\r\n\r\n1. Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission at New Delhi (in short the &#39;National Commission&#39;). Respondent had filed a complaint against the appellant before the National Commission.\r\n\r\n2. Background facts in a nutshell are as follows:\r\n\r\n3. In the complaint respondent inter alia stated as follows:\r\n\r\nThe complainant company, desirous of opening a cold storage unit in the State of Karnataka, applied for allotment of land to the appellant in August 1991. After meeting all the formalities required from time to time by the appellant, a plot bearing No.2 of Chickballapur Industrial Area, measuring 2.5 acre of land, was allotted for setting up a cold storage. Possession certificate was issued on 26/30.8.93. The complainant also in the meantime obtained a loan of Rs.67 lakh from the Karnataka State Financial Corporation (in short &#39;KFC&#39;). For the first time in August 1994, a letter was written by appellant to the complainant that &quot;the company could not go ahead with construction activity on the plot allotted as the erstwhile land owner of plot No.2 covered in Sy.No.29 and 30 of Jadalathimmanahally Village has obtained stay order from the High Court of Karnataka in W.P.No.70/88 challenging the acquisition proceedings. The Board initiated action for vacating the stay order granted by the High Court of Karnataka. However, the company could not go ahead with implementation in view of the stay order granted by the High Court. The complainant sought for permission to go ahead with implementation after the litigation in respect of the above land is disposed of by the High Court. The Board should also grant extension of time to the company for implementation of the project after disposal of the litigation.\r\n\r\n4. Original land holder took back possession forcibly in view of the order of the Karnataka High Court. The writ petition filed by the original land holder was allowed by the High Court leaving the complainant high and dry without land, more so when in September 1994, the KFC cancelled the term loan in view of the fact that no progress was made in the implementation of the project. Since the complainant was keen to go ahead with the project, on collecting some information, it approached the appellant to allot plot No.1-A and 1-B which was lying vacant, which were allotted to the complainant in 1995. But it seems that bad luck had not stopped chasing the complainant. As soon as the allotment in respect of plot no.1- A and 1-B were made on a resumed plot, the original allottees moved the High Court making the complainant a party before it. However, after protracted litigation, the writ petition was dismissed but in the meanwhile the loans had been cancelled and the complain Consumer Protection Act, 1986 - Sections 2 (1) (g) and 21- - Deficiency in administration - Allotment of plot for setting up mechanical units- - About insufficiency in administration, adjust approach received by National Commission - However, remuneration conceded is on higher side- - Hence, decreased to Rs. one lakh from Rs. three lakhs.\r\n NA'), 'idx_court_decisions_0', '', 5 AS around, 300 AS

MOHAPATRA,J This appeal, filed by accused no.1 Babu Kuttan Ramkrishna Pillai and accused no.2 Umesh @ Babu Purshottam Bhatt of TADA ACT Spl.Case No.33 of 1994, is directed against the judgment and order dated 21.8.1998 of the Designated Court at Brihan `Mumbai under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 (for short TADA Act). In the said case seven accused persons faced trial under Section 120-B read with 307 r/w 34, 307 r/w 114, 307 r/w 149, 387 r/w 34, 143, 144, 147, 148 and 506 (ii), 353 r/w 114 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 3(2)(ii), 3(3), 3(5), 5 and 6 of the TADA Act and section r/w 25(IB)\r\n\r\n(a), Section 5 r/w 27 of the Arms Act. The gist of the prosecution case relevant for the purpose of this proceeding may be stated thus: With the growth of industry, commerce and trade in and around the city of Mumbai which generates substantial quantity of wealth, there has been increase of organised activities by gangs of anti-socials to extract money from affluent sections of society like developers, hoteliers and other businessmen by putting them in fear of death and then to demand substantial sums of money commonly known as &quot;Khadani&quot; i.e. protection money. One such gang was operating in the city under Amar Naik @ Bhai, who died a couple of years before the decision in the case at an encounter with the police. The prosecution alleged that in pursuance of a criminal conspiracy between 15.1.1994 to 16.5.1994 the accused persons and others of the gang embarked upon preparatory acts like procuring the information about the names of the builders of M/s Kalpataru Construction Company which was engaged in developing a property at Pali Hill, named Nakshatra Building. PW-7 Sudhir Tambe was the Senior Vice-President of the company with its head office at Nariman Point. He used to sit in the head- office. PW 6 Pachapur, Civil Engineer, was an employee of the company who used to remain at the site to supervise the construction. As the prosecution story runs, on 15.4.1994 between 11.30 a.m. and 12.00 noon while PW 6 was on duty at the construction site, accused no.3, Nitin Vasant Venugurlekar armed with revolver and accused No.4 Rajindera @ Rajan Mahadeo Margaj armed with a chopper and accused no.5 Jayendra @ Jai Anandrao Jadhav also armed with a chopper visited the site of Nakshatra Building; they threatened the workers at the site, forcibly brought PW 6 Pachapur in a room on the ground floor and man-handled him. Accused no.3, pointing a revolver at him demanded the name, address and telephone number of the builders. PW 6 disclosed the name of PW 7 Tambe and gave his telephone number to them. The accused then asked him to go to the office of the builders at Nariman Point and make the arrangement for a telephonic talk with Tambe. PW 6 rushed to the office and told Tambe of what had happened at the construction site. This was followed by telephonic calls from the accused who wanted to speak to Tambe. Attempts were made by PW 6 and PW 7 to avoid any discussion with the gangsters. Two or three days thereafter when the accused got Tambe on the telephone he (Tambe) gave them some other telephone numbers and asked them to contact those persons including one D.N.Ghosh, the Security Contractor. Eight/ten days thereafter again a telephone call was made to the office of Tambe which was received by PW 6 who was informed by the person making the call that they could not get D. N. Ghosh on the telephone numbers furnished by Tambe. Thereafter PW 6 handed over the receiver to Tambe. This incident was followed by several threats given by the gangsters to workers and also repeated telephone calls made to the Head Office of the company to contact Tambe. The staff of the site office absented from work resulting in virtual closure of construction activity. On 11.5.1994 the deceased Sanjay Patil telephoned to Tambe and warned him that he is wasting time and should meet him without further delay. After some days there was one more similar call from Sanjay Patil and he asked Tambe that he should talk to Bhai and saying so he handed over the receiver to another person who gave his identity as Amar Naik (since deceased), who told Tambe that he should pay Rs.10 lacs. The later pleaded his inability to pay such a heavy sum and after some discussion agreed to pay Rs.5 lacs. He was asked to come to Nakshatra Building site on 16.5.1994 along with money. In the meantime Tambe informed all the happenings to the Addl. Commissioner of Police Mr.Sanjeev Dayal and the then Dy. Commissioner of Police of Zone VII Mr. Rajanish Sheth within whose jurisdiction Khar Police Station fell.\r\n\r\nOn 16.5.1994 at about 12.00 noon the deceased Sanjay Patil telephoned Tambe and inquired from him as to what he was going to do about the payment and then Tambe replied that he will be leaving office at about 2.00 p.m. for Pali Hill. Sanjay Patil cautioned him that he should not make any haste and he should wait for his call so that he will take necessary instructions from his boss i.e. Amar Naik. At about 2.00 p.m. on that day there was a telephone call from Sanjay Patil telling that Tambe should not meet him at the Nakshatra Building site but instead he should meet him near the Ceaser Palace Hotel. This telephonic conversation was tape-recorded. Tambe was instructed on telephone that his man shall carry a white plastic bag containing the amount of Rs.5 lacs and shall wait near the entrance gate of Ceaser\r\n Indian Penal Code Section 120-B r/w 307, 34 likewise 307, r/w 114, 149 and 387 r/w 34, 143, 144, 147, 148 and 506(ii), 353 r/w 114 - Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 `TADA Act&#39; 25(IB)(a) - the Arms Act Section 5, 27 - Indian Penal Code, Section 120-B and 395 considered as saw - charged sentenced detainment for a long time - We do not find that the appreciation of evidence made by the learned trial Judge suffers from any illegality nor can findings recorded by him be said to be perverse- Appeal rejected.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n Appeal Dismissed','Jullundur Improvement Trust Vs Mohan Singh (Dead) By L.Rs. And Ors ORDER\r\n\r\n1. The respondents are the legal representatives of the deceased respondent..\r\n\r\n2. The Jullundur Improvement Trust was established and constituted under the Punjab Town Improvement Trust, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Improvement Trust&quot;). One of the duties and functions assigned to the trust is to frame development schemes for benefit of public. The improvement trust framed scheme known as &quot;development scheme&quot; for providing land to public within the municipal limits of Jullundur city. On 4.1.1970, the Trust resolved that the employees and trustees of the Jullundur Improvement Trust shall be granted residential accommodation on &quot;no profit no loss&quot; basis under the aforesaid scheme. It is not disputed that the plaintiff-respondent herein was one of the trustees of the improvement trust. On 22.1.1971, the plaintiff-respondent submitted an application for allotment of residential plot. While the said application was pending, the government 6y order dated 27.1.1971, directed that no trustee shall be allotted any plot of land in the development scheme formulated by the Improvement Trust at a reserved price. Despite that order of the state government, the trust by resolution dated 24.2.1971, resolved to allot a residential plot to the plaintiff-respondent subject to the approval of the state government. On 31.8.1971, a provisional letter of allotment of land was issued to the plaintiff-respondent. In pursuance thereof, it is alleged that the respondent deposited the price of the land. When the aforesaid fact came to the notice of the government, the government by letter dated 5.9.1972 called upon the improvement trust to show cause under what circumstances, the provisional allotment has been made in favour of the plaintiff-respondent. It is not disputed that the said scheme was subsequently not approved by the state government and it fell through. Under these circumstances, the plaintiff-respondent filed a suit for permanent injunction restraining the appellant herein from committing the breach of the alleged agreement and from cancelling the provisional allotment made i\r\n Trust and Societies - Contract - Specific help - Injunction - Improvement trust confined advancement conspire for giving area to open inside the civil furthest reaches of city - Employees and trustees to get convenience on no benefit no misfortune&quot; premise under the plan - Despite request of the state government that no trustee should be allocated any plot of land at a saved value, a determination gone by trust in which the offended party respondent partook and got a distribution of land - Scheme is no longer a subsisting plan as not endorsed by state Govt. - No closing contract has appeared between the litigant trust and the respondent - Relief of changeless directive looked for in the suit couldn&#39;t have been allowed by the trial court and insisted by the High Court - Sections 38, 39 and 41 of Specific Relief Act, 1963.\r\n Appeal Dismissed With Cost','Dasrath vs State Of M.P on 29 July, 2010 V.S. SIRPURKAR, J.\r\n\r\n1. The present appeal is directed against the judgment of the High Court dismissing the appeal of the appellant Dasrath. He was convicted by the Trial Court of the offence under Section 304B,&nbsp;Indian Penal Code&nbsp;(IPC) and was sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and pay a fine of Rs. 5,000/- and in default directed to suffer further imprisonment for one year. He was also convicted for the offence under&nbsp;Section 201,&nbsp;IPC&nbsp;and was directed to suffer rigorous imprisonment for one&nbsp;year with a fine of Rs.1,000/- and in default to suffer three month&#39;s further imprisonment.\r\n\r\n2. Initially, as many as three accused persons came to be tried by the Sessions Judge, they being accused No.1, Kalyan, accused No.2, Dasrath and accused No.3, Smt. Usha. While accused No.2, Dasrath is the present appellant, accused No.1, Kalyan Singh and accused No.3, Smt. Usha are his father and sister, respectively. The Trial Court had also convicted Kalyan Singh for the same offence. However, it acquitted accused No.3, Smt. Usha from all the charges. Both the accused had filed an appeal challenging their conviction and the sentences before the High Court. However, during the pendency of the appeal, accused No.1 Kalyan Singh expired and his appeal, thus, abated. The appeal of Dasrath, the present appellant came to be dismissed by the High Court and that is how he is before us.\r\n\r\n3. Shortly stated, the prosecution story was that Dasrath was married to Pinki who died under suspicious circumstance of burning. An intimation regarding death came to be given to the Police Station Pandhokhar, Distt. Gwalior. The said intimation was given by the complainant Vadehi Saran s/o Ramanand Kaurav who was none else but the father of the deceased Pinki. It was, inter alia, stated that on that day i.e. 12.8.1992 in the morning his son Jitendra Singh had gone to village Saujna for Rakhi&nbsp;festival to his daughter Pinki&#39;s house. But he returned at about 7 p.m. and told him that Pinki had caught fire and was sent to Daboh for treatment. Vadehi Saran further stated that on hearing the news, he along with some co-villagers went to Daboh. However, one Santosh belonging to his village met him near Dugdha Dairy and told him that Pinki had died. Then Vadehi Saran along with others went to village Saujna. But by the time they reached there, Pinki&#39;s cremation was over. It was because of this that they came to the Police Station and further action was requested on the basis of the death report.\r\n\r\n4. On this basis, a First Information Report was got registered on 16.8.92 wherein it was recorded that the death intimation was given on 12.8.92 at 23.15 hours orally about the death of Pinki. It was recorded on a preliminary inquiry made by Head Constable Jaswir Singh by visiting village Saujna and the Station House Officer R.S. Purohit had also made inquiries relating to the death. The place of occurrence was examined by SDOP R.K. Hirodia and inquiry was made from the deceased&#39;s father Vadehi Saran, uncle Uttam Singh, brothers Janved Singh and Jitendra Singh, mother Vidya Devi and sister Pratibha. During this inquiry, it was found that the deceased was married 2 years prior to the date of incident and because of the non-payment of dowry, her husband Dasrath, father-in- law Kalyan Singh and Sister-in-law Usha were harassing her. The earlier&nbsp;statement given by Vadehi Saran was repeated. It was then mentioned that on 12.8.1992 the sister-in-law Usha, husband Dasrath caught hold of Pinki and father-in-law Kalyan Singh poured kerosene oil on her and set her on fire because of which she got burnt. The accused thereafter cremated her and cleaned the place where occurrence had taken place.\r\n\r\n5. On the basis of this, further investigation ensued and after its completion, a charge-sheet came to be filed in the Court for offences under&nbsp;Sections 302,&nbsp;304&nbsp;B and 201&nbsp;IPC. The accused were charged accordingly. The prosecution, during the trial, examined as many as 11 witnesses. The accused persons abjured the guilt and as stated earlier only two of them came to be convicted, namely, Kalyan Singh and Dasrath. However, due to the death of Kalyan Singh during the pendency of the appeal, the appeal filed by Dasrath alone is to be considered.\r\n\r\n6. Learned Senior Counsel, Dr. J.N. Singh appearing on behalf of the accused attacked the judgment of both the Courts below, firstly, contending that conviction under&nbsp;Section 304B,&nbsp;IPC&nbsp;and Section, 201,&nbsp;IPC&nbsp;was wholly incorrect as it was not proved that Pinki had died a suspicious or un-natural death within the seven years of her marriage nor was her body found. He also contended that there was no question of demanding any dowry as no complaint was ever made for dowry nor was there any evidence regarding the demands of dowry. Lastly, he suggested that there&nbsp;was no question of any offence having been committed. He pointed out that the Trial Court had acquitted all the accused of the offence under&nbsp;Section 302,&nbsp;IPC&nbsp;though a charge was also framed under that Section and there was no appeal by the State Government against the acquittal under&nbsp;Section 302,&nbsp;IPC. Under such circumstances, it was clear that the accused persons could not be held responsible for the death of Pinki.\r\n\r\n7. As against this, Ms. Aishwarya Bhati, Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent pointed out that it could not be said that the death did not take place within seven years of marriage as the accused himself had admitted that the marriage had taken place six years prior to the trial. She further pointed out that there was a clear assertion made by the witnesses in their evidence. More particularly, Vadehi Saran (PW 4), Janved Singh (PW-5), Pratibha (PW-6) and Jitendra Singh (PW-8) had clearly asserted that the dowry was asked for by the accused persons. Learned Counsel further contended that if Pinki had died of burning, a report ought to have been made for un-natural death which the accused did not bother to make, instead they had cremated the body of Pinki without even intimating the relatives of the deceased and also without waiting for the police. This was the most suspicious circumstance which pointed towards the guilt of the accused.\r\n\r\n8. It is on the basis of these rival versions that it is to be seen as to whether the appellant Dasrath was rightly convicted for the offence.\r\n\r\n9. The first contention raised by the Learned Counsel for the defence regarding the corpus delicti not being found was countered by Ms. Bhati by saying that there can be no dispute about the death of Pinki. It is not the defence of the accused that Pinki was still living. On the other hand, the accused persons admittedly had cremated her body on the fateful day. Therefore, this is not a case, according to her, of corpus delicti not being found and, therefore, there being a serious suspicion about the death having taken place at all. The question is, in the absence of corpus delicti, could it be presumed that the accused persons alone were responsible for the death of Pinki. We must hasten to add here that the accused persons have already been acquitted of the murder charge. What remains to be seen is as to whether Pinki died an un-natural death within seven years of her marriage and whether her death was attributable to the demand of dowry and further whether she was dealt with cruelly soon before her death. If these ingredients are proved by the prosecution then the conviction of the accused under&nbsp;Section 304B,&nbsp;IPC&nbsp;will be complete.\r\n\r\n10. There can be no dispute that Pinki had died an un-natural death. In fact there is enough evidence to suggest that Pinki suffered the burn injuries. It is not the defence of the accused that she died a natural death.&nbsp;Both the Courts have very specifically held that Pinki suffered burn injuries and died because of the same. In fact Jitendra Singh (PW-8) was specific in his evidence that Pinki was burning on account of the kerosene having been poured on her body. In fact it is apparent from his cross-examination that when Pinki shouted, neighbours rushed to her house. There can be no dispute that this witness has been dis-believed and rightly so, insofar as his evidence about the accused deliberately burning Pinki is concerned. However, there can be no dispute that Pinki was burnt and it was clear that she had died an un-natural death. Again, it is clear from the report of the chemical analyzer that the kerosene residues were found from Packet-A which contained the clothes of Pinki which were seized during the investigation. Therefore, it is clear that Pinki&#39;s death was caused because of the burns and not in the normal circumstances. The finding of the Trial Court and the appellate Court in that behalf is correct. For this reason we are not impressed by the argument of the Learned Counsel that in the absence of corpus delicti, the conviction could not stand. Similarly, there can be no dispute that Pinki died within seven years of her marriage. Gandharv Singh (PW-1) had specifically asserted that the marriage was performed 3-4 years prior to the incident. Though this witness was declared hostile, at least the fact that marriage had taken place 3-4 years prior to the incident can be safely accepted. According to PW-2, Bhagwati Saran also the marriage had taken place within 5-6 years prior to trial.&nbsp;Again even this witness was declared hostile. However, that claim remained un-controverted. Third witness PW-3, Hari Saran asserted that the marriage was performed 6-7 years earlier to the date of his evidence. His evidence was in May, 1997 and even taking that the marriage took place somewhere in the year 1990, it would still be within seven years. Vadehi Saran, the father also said that the marriage had taken place 6-7 years prior to the date of his evidence which was again 30.09.1997. Therefore, according to his evidence even if the marriage could date back to the year 1987, it would still put the death of Pinki within seven years of her marriage.\r\n\r\n11. Therefore, it is certain that Pinki died an un-natural death by burning within seven years of her marriage. As regards dowry, Learned Counsel for the defence pointed out that there was no specific evidence nor was any allegation made in the First Information Report. We are not much impressed as we have seen from the evidence that there were demands of Buffalo made to Vadehi Saran, father of Pinki who did not accept that demand. Vadehi Saran has also specifically stated in his evidence that after 1 = years of the marriage when he went to the house of Pinki in the month of Shravan, door was closed and the appellants were beating Pinki and that the floor was smeared with blood and blood was also oozing out from the mouth of Pinki. He also asserted about the demand of a large&nbsp;size television as the television which was given in marriage was a small colour television. This evidence of torture is well supported by the evidence of Pratibha (PW-6), Anant Ram Singh (PW-7) and Uttam Singh (PW-9). In view of this, the Trial court and the appellate Court have recorded that, firstly, Pinki died an un-natural death because of burning within seven years of her marriage and, secondly concluded that she was subjected to cruelty and harassment by her husband and/or relatives in connection with the demand for dowry and that she was subjected to cruelty soon before her death.\r\n\r\n12. Similar is the case as regards the offence under&nbsp;Section 201,&nbsp;IPC. In fact it was incumbent upon the accused persons to firstly, inform the police about the un-natural death of Pinki. They did not do so. On the other hand, even after her death, they did not inform either the police or even the relatives like her father etc., though they could have done so. In stead they hurriedly conducted the funeral thereby causing destruction of evidence.\r\n\r\n13.&nbsp;In State of Rajasthan v. Jaggu Ram&nbsp;[2008 (12) SCC 51], this Court has considered the circumstance about the non-information to the parents and the hurried cremation. This was also a case where accused persons were tried for offence under&nbsp;Section 304B,&nbsp;IPC, where the accused, after the death of the unfortunate lady did not bother to inform her parents. In&nbsp;paragraph 26, this Court took a serious note of the manner in which the body was disposed of. The Court observed &quot;the disposal of the dead body in a hush-hush manner clearly establishes that the accused had done so with the sole object of concealing the real cause of death of Shanti @ Gokul.&quot;\r\n\r\n14. In that case, the funeral was conducted in the wee hours. In this case, funeral was conducted in the evening.\r\n\r\n15. From all this, it is clear that the prosecution has not only proved the offence under&nbsp;Section 304B,&nbsp;IPC&nbsp;with the aid of&nbsp;Section 113B,&nbsp;Indian Evidence Act&nbsp;but also the offence under&nbsp;Section 201,&nbsp;IPC. We are satisfied that all the three ingredients of&nbsp;Section 304B,&nbsp;IPC, they being:\r\n\r\na) that the death of a woman has been caused by burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under normal circumstances;\r\n\r\nb)&nbsp;that such death has been caused or has occurred within seven years of her marriage; and\r\n\r\nc)&nbsp;that soon before her death the woman was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband in connection with any demand for dowry.&quot;\r\n\r\nas also the presumption under&nbsp;Section 113B&nbsp;of India Evidence Act are fully established the case of prosecution.\r\n\r\n16. We have gone through the judgments of the Trial Court as well as the appellate Court carefully and we find that both the Courts have fully considered all the aspects of this matter. We, therefore, find nothing wrong with the judgments and confirm the same. The appeal is, therefore, dismissed.\r\n\r\n.......................................J.\r\n\r\n(V.S.

However, in 1972 the State had its own&nbsp;Forest Act. The primary object of the legislation was protection and management of forests in the State. The words &#39;forest officer&#39; have been defined under the Act to mean persons whom the State Government, or any officer empowered by it in this behalf, may appoint to carry out all or any of the purposes of the Act. A forest officer would include the Principal Chief Conservator of Forest as well as subordinates like Conservator of Forests, Forest Range Officers, Deputy Rangers and Foresters. In the year 1979 the State of Orissa adopted the Antyodaya Programme of the Central Government. Under the said programme Social Forestry Projects were undertaken which envisaged contact with the poorest of poor farmers to educate and train them in matters connected with farming. For purpose of the Social Forestry Projects, ex cadre posts of Forestry Extension Officers (for short &#39;FEOs&#39;) were created by the State Government. These were project related posts and their expenses were met from special funds raised for the project. The project was for specific purpose and for a specific period and was funded by the Central Government. The duration of the project was, however, extended from time to time in order to fulfil its objective.\r\n\r\nThe recruitment for the posts of FEOs was to be made from the open market. The officers were to be given training in raising of seedlings, nursery work etc. so that when they go to the field they could properly motivate and educate the farmers. The minimum qualification prescribed for FEOs was Intermediate with Botany as a subject. After recruitment these officers were to be posted in blocks wherein forestry extension work was undertaken. Certain blocks within the State were selected for such extension work as a part of the Forestry Extension Programme. The FEOs were envisaged as somebody remaining in touch with small farmers at the lowest level in each village block and assessing their requirements of forest species and other species. The respondents were recruited as Forestry Extension Officers under the Project from 1979 onwards. The respondents claim that they should be treated as part of the forest service under the Forest Department of the State Government and the posts held by them should have equal pay and equal status with the equal level posts in the Forest Department. They further claim that the posts held by them should be included in the channel of promotion to higher posts in the forest Department. The grievance of the respondents is that they have been stagnating in the posts of FEOs to which they were recruited nearly twenty years ago. According to them though the project has senior level posts of Social Forestry Supervisors but these posts are being filled by getting officers from forest service of the State Government on deputation, thereby the posts are being denied to them. In the matter of pay scales the grievance of the FEOs is that they are being equated with foresters who are neither as qualified as they are nor the foresters discharge such important functions as they are discharging. The minimum educational qualification prescribed for the post of forester in the quota meant for direct recruits at the relevant time was Matriculation only. The FEOs are trained to motivate people under Social Forestry Projects which requires contact with individual farmers and working at the grass root level. On the other hand, officers of the Forest Department of the State are mainly concerned with protecting forests, including forest property, preventing illegal felling of trees, keeping a check on forest contractors in order to ensure that forest produce is not illegally exploited and removed, prevention of poaching of forest animals etc..\r\n\r\nIn the year 1990, some of the Forest Extension Officers (FEOs) approached the Orrisa Administrative Tribunal for purposes of relief with regard to the above demands. In fact, before approaching the Tribunal they had made representation to the Government which did not yield any result. This Original Application was disposed of by the Orissa Administrative Tribunal vide order dated 7.9.1995. The Tribunal noted that the government was alive to the grievance being aired by the FEOs. It directed the State Government to decide the question of fixation of pay scales of FEOs within six months. The Association of the FEOs was allowed an opportunity to be heard by the officers of the State Government who would be taking such a decision on behalf of the government. The Tribunal further observed that when the question of pay scales would be considered, the question of promotional avenues should also be taken into consideration. It appears that nothing happened in pursuance of the said direction of the Tribunal. The Association of FEOs again approached the Tribunal by way of an application in the year 1996. The main grievance of the Association was that inspite of the FEOs being well qualified, they were being made to stagnate as there were no chances of promotion to higher posts available for them. The other grievance was about not getting appropriate scale of pay. The respondents claim that they should be treated as equivalent to Forest Rangers and the scale of pay and service benefits given to Forest Rangers should be available to them also.\r\n\r\nThe Tribunal noted that the nature of duties performed by FEOs and the Foresters could not be compared because the two were entirely different. Similarly, the method of recruitment and the basic qualifications required for eligibility to the two posts were different. However, the grievance of the FEOs could not be overlooked. Undoubtedly, the FEOs were not getting any chances of promotion nor they were getting the pay scales commensurate to the duties and functions being performed by them. Having regard to these aspects the Tribunal directed that those FEOs who have put in more than ten years of service as FEOs should be treated at par with the post of Deputy Ranger in the state forest service and placed in the same scale of pay which is now applicable to Deputy Rangers. They should also be made eligible for promotion to the posts of Forest Rangers. Those FEOs who have put in less than ten years of service may be treated at par with Foresters and be made eligible for promotion as Deputy Rangers. The Tribunal noted that it was stated in the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the Government in the proceedings before the Tribunal that steps were being taken for movement of the FEOs to other divisions so as to induct them into the mainstream. The Tribunal expected that this movement should start which would result in FEOs with more than ten years of service being posted as Deputy Rangers when they are moved from Social Forestry Section and others should be posted as Foresters. In view of the averments in the counter affidavit the Tribunal recommended to the State Government that the exercise in terms of the above directions should start without further delay so as to equip the FEOs for their induction into the mainstream whenever the Social Forestry Welfare Scheme is abolished. The order of the Tribunal also contained a direction that in future vacancies for Forest Rangers and Deputy Rangers quotas should be earmarked for FEOs with more than ten years of service and FEOs with less than ten years of service respectively. The Tribunal directed the State Government to complete the exercise within four weeks.\r\n\r\nThe State Government issued an order on 19th May, 1998 carrying out the directions contained in the aforesaid judgment of the Orissa Administrative Tribunal. Those Forest Extension Officers who had put in more than ten years of service were to be treated at par with Deputy Rangers and placed in the same pay scale i.e. 1200-30-1560-EB-40-2040. Since out of 105 Forestry Extension Officers, 100 had already completed more than ten years of service as FEOs they were to be declared Senior Grade Forestry Extension Officers and were to be made eligible for promotion to the post of Forest Ranger. Those FEOs who had rendered less than ten years of service were to be treated at par with Foresters. The order contained further details about how the various quotas were to be worked out and postings were to be made.\r\n\r\nOne of the Foresters, under an apprehension that FEOs belonging to the Social Forestry Projects were being merged with the mainstream forest service of the State, approached the State Administrative Tribunal in the year 1998 seeking a declaration that Forestry Extension Officer do not belong to the cadre of the state forest service and that they should not be promoted to the posts of Deputy Rangers. The case of the applicant before the Tribunal was that the Social Forestry Project was a project scheme and the FEOs appointed under that scheme held ex-cadre posts. They were appointed to execute the Project and, therefore, they had nothing to do with regular forest service under the State Government. Since they were holding ex-cadre posts they could not claim promotion to the posts under the cadre. The Tribunal in its order dated 27th January, 1999 found that the apprehension of the petitioner before it was totally misplaced. The Forestry Extension Officers were being given only the pay scales of the equivalent posts in the State Government. Giving equivalent pay scales did not mean that they were being merged with the forest service of the State Government. Similarly regarding their promotions to the posts of Senior Social Forestry Extension Officer, their identity was being kept separate. The equivalence was provided only qua the scales of pay. The Tribunal noted:\r\n\r\n&quot;6. There is nothing in the letter of 19th May, 1998 to show that at any point of time the posts of Social Forestry Extension Officers or Senior Grade Social Forestry Extension Officers on one side and the Deputy Rangers and Foresters on the other have been made interchangeable posts. In order to give incentive to the Extension Officers only a separate channel of promotion has been creatd for them. Neither an Extension Officer can claim a post of Deputy Ranger nor a Forester can claim the post of Senior Grade Forestry Extension Officer.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe Tribunal further observed:\r\n\r\n&quot;7. However, in sub-para (i) of paragraph 1 of the said letter there is an observation that the forestry Extension Officer with more than 10 years of service should be posted as Deputy Ranger when it is proposed to move them out of the Social Forestry Directorate and others having less than ten years of service may be posted as Foresters. We are of the vie that since the government do not intend to make the posts interchangeable, this observation cannot be accepted as reasonable. Until the Extension Officers and Senior Extension Officers are regularly absorbed in the cadre of Foresters and Deputy Rangers and Rangers, they cannot be allowed to hold the posts of Ranger/Deputy Ranger or Forester. We, therefore, advise the State Government to frame a scheme or rules for their absorption in the Forest Department in the event of the abolition of the Directorate of Social Forestry. Until then, the Extension Officers shall not be brought over to the cadre of Foresters and Deputy Rangers. In case the Government desire that the Senior Grade Forest Extension Officer should also have further promotional facility, it is open to the State Government to consider and create appropriate promotional posts for them.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe above order was passed on 27th January, 1999. The State Government filed a Special Leave Petition in this Court challenging the earlier order of the Tribunal dated 5th March, 1997 in the first week of November, 2000 without even making a reference to the subsequent order dated 27th January, 1999. Thus the order dated 27th January, 1999 has not been challenged by any party. Leave to appeal was granted in the Special Leave Petition and the matter was registered as Civil Appeal No.1079 of 2001 which is being disposed of by this order.\r\n\r\nDuring the pendency of this Civil Appeal the Government of Orrisa passed a resolution dated 8th August, 2003 re-organising the field establishments of the Forest and Environment Department under the &#39;Forestry and Wildlife&#39; wing by abolishing the Afforestation and Social Forestry Division and Circles and creating a number of Territorial and Wildlife Divisions and Circles. Further the resolution abolishes certain establishments including the Social Forestry Department. The staff of the Departments which were being abolished was deployed within the remaining establishments. The said resolution provides that the Government had decided to abolish eighteen establishments under the control of Director, Social Forestry Project with which we are concerned in the present case. With the abolition of eighteen establishments of Social Forestry Project, the staff of the establishments is to be deployed in the Divisions/Circles/State Forest Headquarters as per the plan given in the resolution. The resolution came into effect on the date it was issued i.e. 8th August, 2003 and provides that the reorganization exercise was to be completed by 30th September, 2003. The exercise had started and in pursuance thereof a Memo dated 24.10.2003 was issued. None of the parties appearing before us have disputed the said resolution. In fact, an affidavit was filed in the present proceedings on behalf of the respondent Association bringing the said resolution on record. The respondents further stated that in view of the resolution dated 8th August, 2003 the points sought to be raised by the Government in the present appeal were no longer available to it. By the said resolution the members of the respondent-association i.e. Forest Extension Officers (FEOs) who were working under the Social Forestry Projects had been taken into the mainstream i.e. into the Forest Department of the Government of Orissa called the Territorial and Wildlife Division. The Social Forestry Directorate stands abolished. It is a resolution of the State Government. Naturally the learned counsel for the appellant, i.e. the State of Orissa accepts the resolution. In view of these developments the FEOs have ceased to be officers working against a particular project. They have become part of the forest service of the State Government. Their grievances do not survive any more. We have also heard the learned counsel appearing for some of the forest service officers who had intervened in these proceedings. He has tried to canvas that the position of his clients should not be adversely affected due to the merger. As at present he could not spell out any cause for worry for his clients. In any case, in the event of any prejudice being caused to the interveners, they will have independent cause of action for which they are free to pursue their remedies. So far as the State Government is concerned, it is bound by its resolution and, in fact, has taken steps to implement the same. Nothing survives in this appeal. The same is accordingly dismissed as having become infructuous.

The Commissioner of Gift Tax, Kerala, has appealed to this Court. Held: Court is unable to agree with the views so expressed. The donor is exempt under s. 5 (1) (xiv) from liability to pay tax only if the gift is in the course of carrying on a business, pro fession or vocation and is made bona fide for the purpose of such business, profession or vocation. The clause does not enact that a gift made by a person carrying on any business is exempt from tax, nor does it provide that a gift is exempt from tax merely because the property is used for the purpose for which it was used by the donor. Without deciding whether the test of commercial expediency&quot; is strictly appropriate to the claim 3 76 for exemption under S. 5 ( 1 ) (xiv), we are of the view that there is no evidence on the record to prove that the gift to Thomas was &quot;in the course of carrying on the business&quot; of the donor, and &quot;for the purpose of the business&quot;. The appeal is allowed and the order passed by the High Court is set aside. The Commissioner of Gift Tax will get his costs in this Court and the High Court.

The accused persons are the father and brother respectively of the deceased. The incident purportedly took place on 3.1.1990. Though the prosecution relied on the evidence of many persons who supposedly witnessed the occurrence, while deposing in Court, most of them resiled from the statements made during investigation. The version projected by the prosecution was that the deceased was throttled and also poison was administered to him. But the report of the Forensic Science Laboratory stated that the viscera did not contain any poison. The prosecution, therefore, gave up its stand that the deceased was administered poison by the accused persons. There were purportedly some extra-judicial confessions on which the Trial Court relied. Accordingly, the accused persons were convicted for offences punishable under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short &#39;IPC&#39;). In appeal the High Court has, by the impugned judgment, directed acquittal.\r\n\r\nLearned counsel for the appellant-State su\r\n Criminal - Extra legal admission - Section 302 perused with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 - Trial Court sentenced the respondents on the premise of additional legal admissions - In offer High Court cleared the respondents - Hence, introduce request - Held, High Court alluded to the additional legal admissions and found not solid - Witnesses gave shifting rendition about the way in the purported additional legal admissions - Persons who asserted to have seen the occurrence resiled from the announcements made amid examination - No proof to embroil the denounced people - Manipulation done to show report gotten by Magistrate on 3.1.1990 while date of seal found on Exh.

Subhashini for the Respondents.\n     The Judgment of the Court was delivered by\n     RANGANATHAN, J.  The seeds	 of the	 present controversy\nwere sown  as early  as in 1946. It is unfortunate that this\nmatter should  be  coming  up  before  this  Court  for	 its\nconsideration nearly  five decades  later, though it must be\npointed out  that the  issue in	 its  present  form  is	 the\noutcome of an amendment made by the Finance (No.2) Act, 1980\n(hereinafter referred  to as  &apos;the 1980	 Act&apos;) to the Income\nTax Act,  1961* (hereinafter referred to as &apos;the 1961 Act&apos;).\nIt is also a curious co-incidence that the 1980 Act effected\ntwo amendments in the 1961 Act with retrospective effect and\nthe validity  of both  these provisions have been challenged\nbefore the courts. The first was the controversy with regard\nto the	retrospective amendment	 of s.80-J which was settled\nby this	 Court by its decision in Lohia Machines Limited  v.\nUnion of India, (1985) 152 I.T.R. 308 (SC). It is the second\namendment to  the provisions  contained in  section 35(2) of\nthe 1961  Act that has given rise to the present controversy\nbetween the parties.\n     The question  is really  one of  interpretation of	 two\nimportant provisions relating to the computation of business\nincome for  purposes of	 income tax.  We may  start with the\nprovisions of  the Indian  lncome Tax Act, 1922 (hereinafter\nreferred to  as the &apos;1922 Act&apos;). The computation of business\nincome for  purposes of	 income tax  was done  in accordance\nwith the  provisions of	 section 10  of the said Act. In the\nprocess of making such computation, the Act provided for two\nimportant deductions  (among  others),	in  respect  of	 the\ncapital assets	employed in  the business. The first was the\ndeduction under clause (vi) of Section 10(2) of an allowance\nin respect of the depreciation of building, machinery, plant\nor furniture being the property of the assessee and used for\nthe purposes  of the business, at a prescribed percentage of\nthe written  down value	 of such  assets. This	allowance is\ncalculated, in	respect of  the year  of acquisition  of the\nproperty, at a percentage of its actual cost to the assessee\nand in subsequent years at a graduated scale on the basis of\nthe actual  cost less the depreciation allowances granted in\nthe preceding years. In strict principle, this is an\nallowance of  capital nature but it is now well settled that\nthe allowance  of depreciation	has to be taken into account\nin order  to ascertain	the true  profits of a business and,\ntherefore, an  assessee	 is  permitted	to  deduct,  in	 the\ncomputation of	the business  income year  after  year,	 the\nprescribed percentage  of the  value of	 the assets used for\nthe purposes of business. The second allowance was not there\nin the 1922 Act originally and was introduced by the Income-\ntax (Amendment)	 Act, 1946.  The introduction was of certain\nallowances  in	 respect  of   expenditure  on.	 \"scientific\nresearch related  to the  business\", an expression which was\ndefined in  a fairly  comprehensive manner  by the  statute.\nThree types  of allowances were permitted in respect of this\ncategory of  expenditure of which we are here concerned with\nonly one.  This provision  was contained  in clause (xiv) of\nS.10(2) which permitted a deduction.\n     \"in respect of any expenditure of a\n     capital   nature	 on   scientific\n     research related  to the  business,\n     an allowance  for each  of the Five\n     consecutive     previous	   year.\n     beginning	 with the  year in which\n     the expenditure  was  incurred,  or\n     where the	expenditure was incurred\n     prior to  the commencement	 of  the\n     business,	for  each  of  the  five\n     consecutive     previous	   years\n     beginning with  the year  in  which\n     the business  was commenced,  equal\n     2to one-fifth of such expenditure:\n     Provided that no allowance shall be\n     made for  any expenditure	incurred\n     more than	three years  before  the\n     commencement of the business:\n     A Provided further that-\n      XXX   XXX	    XXX\n     (d) where	a deduction  is	 allowed\n     for any  previous year  under  this\n     clause in	respect	 of  expenditure\n     represented wholly or partly by any\n     asset,  no	  deduction   shall   be\n     allowed under clause (vi) or clause\n     (vii) for the same previous year in\n     respect of that asset;\n     (e) where	an asset  is used in the\n     business after it ceases to be used\n     for scientific  research related to\n     that business,  and a  claim for an\n     allowance	under	clause	(vi)  or\n     clause (vii)  is made in respect of\n     that asset,  the actual cost to the\n     assessee  of  the	asset  shall  be\n     treated as reduced by the amount of\n     any deductions  allowed under  this\n     clause;\"\n     A cursory	and conjoint  reading of  section 10(2) (vi)\nand section  10(2) (xiv)  suggests that	 where	an  assessee\nincurs	expenditure   of  a  capital  nature  on  scientific\nresearch related to the business and the expenditure results\nin the	acquisition of	an asset,  the assessee	 can  claim,\nunder clause  (vi), a  deduction of the specified percentage\nof the	written down  value of	the asset   and under clause\n(xiv) he can ask for a deduction, in five consecutive years,\nof the expenditure he has incurred on the acquisition of the\nasset. For  this purpose, we are assuming that an asset used\nfor scientific research related to the business is also ipso\nfacto an  asset used  for the purpose of business. There has\nbeen some  debate before  us as to whether this is always so\nbut we need not enter into that controversy for the purposes\nof the present case.\n     It will  at once  be seen that, if these two provisions\nare applied   simultaneously, it would result in granting an\nassessee  a   double  allowance	  in  respect  of  the	same\nexpenditure -  one of  the entire amount over a period	of 5\nyears and  the other  a percentage of the expenditure over a\nnumber .  consecutive years  at a  graded scale	 as  already\nmentioned. The	question at  once leaps	 to the	 mind as  to\nwhether it  could have been the intention of the legislature\nto  permit   both  these  deductions  simultaneously  to  an\nassessee. The  provisions of  clauses (d)  and	(e)  of	 the\nproviso to  S.10(2) (xiv)  contain a  clue  to	answer	this\nquestion. More about it later.\n     We next  turn to  the provisions of 1961 Act. The topic\nof depreciation	 is dealt  with by section 32. Section 32(1)\n(ii) provides for depreciation. As under the 1922 Act, it is\nallowed at a percentage of the written down value of certain\ncapital assets	employed in  the  bussiness.  The  topic  of\nscientific research expenditure is dealt with by section 35.\nSection 35(1)  provides for  the deduction  of four types of\nexpenditure on	scientific	research  and  what  we	 are\nconcerned with is the deduction provided under section 35(1)\n(iv), which is to the following effect:\n     (iv) in  respect of any expenditure\n     of a  capital nature  on scientific\n     research related  to  the	business\n     carried on	 by the	 assessee,  such\n     deduction	as   may  be  admissible\n     under  the	    provisions	of  sub-\n     section (2).\"\n     Sub-section (2)  provides that,  for  the	purposes  of\nclause (iv)of  sub-section (1),	 one-fifth  of	the  capital\nexpenditure incurred  in any previous year shall be deducted\nfor that  previous year;  and the balance of the expenditure\nshall be  deducted in  equal instalments in each of the four\nimmediately  succeeding	  previous  years.   There   is	  an\nexplanation which  is not relevant for our present purposes.\nReading S.35(2) further, it provides in clauses (iv) and (v)\nas follows:\n     \"(iv) where  a deduction is allowed\n     for any  previous year  under  this\n     section in	 respect of  expenditure\n     represented wholly	 or partly by an\n     asset,  no	  deduction   shall   be\n     allowed under clauses (i), (ii) and\n     (iii) of sub-section (1) of section\n     32 for  the same  previous year  in\n     respect of that asset;\n     (v) where	the asset  mentioned  in\n     clause (ii) is used in the business\n     after it  ceases  to  be  used  for\n     scientific research related to that\n     business,	depreciation   shall  be\n     admissible under  clauses (i), (ii)\n     and  (iii)	  of  sub-section(1)  of\n     section 32.\"\nReference must	also be made to Explanation 1 to s. 43(1) in\nthis context. It read as follows at the relevant time:\n     \"Explanation:  Where  an  asset  is\n     used in business after it ceases to\n     be	 used  for  scientific	research\n     related  to  that	business  and  a\n     deduction	has  to	 be  made  under\n     clause (i),  clause (ii)  or clause\n     (iii) of  sub-section (I)	or  sub-\n     section  (1A)   of	 section  32  in\n     respect of	 that asset,  the actual\n     cost of  the asset to the assessee,\n     as reduced	 by the	 amount	 of  any\n     deduction allowed under clause (iv)\n     of sub-section (1) of section 35 or\n     under any	corresponding  provision\n     of the  Indian Income-tax Act, 1922\n     (11 of 1922).\"\n     From the  above it	 will be seen that the provisions of\nSection 32(1)  (ii) and	 Section 35(2) (i) (iv) and (v) read\nwith  Explanation   1  to   s.43(1)  virtually	 repeat	 the\nprovisions contained in Section 10(2) (vi) and 10(2)(xiv) of\nthe 1922  Act, so  that the  question  earlier	posed  still\nloomed in the  background of 1961 Act.\n     In 1968  there was	 an amendment  in the  provisions of\nSection 35(2).	The  sub-section  was  amended	to  read  as\nfollows:\n     \"(2) For  the  purposes  of  clause\n     (iv) of sub-section (1),-\n     (i) in  a case  where such	 capital\n     expenditure is  incurred before the\n     1st day  of April,	 1967, one-fifth\n     of the capital expenditure incurred\n     in	 any   previous	 year  shall  be\n     deducted for  that	 previous  year;\n     and the  balance of the expenditure\n     shall   be	   deducted   in   equal\n     instalments for  each of  the  four\n     immediately   succeeding	previous\n     years;\n     (i-a) in  a case where such capital\n     expenditure is  incurred after  the\n     31st day  of March, 1967, the whole\n     of	  such	  capital    expenditure\n     incurred in any previous year shall\n     be	 deducted   for	 that	previous\n     year.\"\n     The effect	 of this amendment was only to provided that\nthe  entire   amount  of  capital  expenditure	incurred  in\nrelation to  scientific research  was allowed as a deduction\nin one	year instead  of being	spread over a period of five\nyears as  was the  position earlier. This amendment does not\ntouch the   controversy	 in issue  before us  and it  has no\nsolution to offer to our present difficulty.\n     The provisions  of Section	 10(2) (vi) and (xiv) of the\nold Act	 had been administered between 1946 and 1962 and the\nprovisions of  Section 32  and 35  of the 1961 Act have been\nadministered since  1962. The  question	 whether an assessee\ncan  simultaneously  claim  an	allowance  or  deduction  in\nrespect of  the same  expenditure once	under Section 32 and\nagain in   Section 35 must have cropped up in some cases and\ndoes appear that such a double claim was put forward in some\ncases. The  contention on  behalf of  the assessees was that\nthe allowances	in respect  of depreciation  on the one hand\nand in respect of capital expenditure on scientific research\non the other are two totally different and independent heads\nof allowances.	 one  is a notional allowance to provide for\nthe wear  and tear  of	a  capital  asset  employed  in	 the\nbusiness as the years roll by; the other is an allowance for\nactual expenditure  of a  capital nature granted, on the eve\nof our	country&apos;s independence,	 in order  to give fillip to\nnew industrial innovations and the development of indigenous\nknow-how and  techniques by  proper planning on research and\ndevelopment by	various business  houses. It  is   therefore\nsuggested that	there is  nothing absurd  in construing	 the\nstatutes act  as providing  cumulatively for  both types  of\ndeductions in  respect of  the same  capital asset. The only\nlimitations on	this right are the two placed by the statute\nitself. The first limitation, contained in clause (d) of the\nproviso to  Section 10(2)  (xiv) and  s.35(2) (iv)  is	that\nboth the deductions cannot be claimed \"for the same previous\nyear\" in  respect of  the same	capital	 asset.	 The  second\nlimitation is found in clause (e) of the proviso  to Section\n10(2) (xiv)  and s.35(2)  (v) which  say that  if a  capital\nasset used  for scientific research ceases to be so used but\nis thereafter  brought into a  business for use therein, the\nactual cost for purposes of granting depreciation in respect\nof the asset thereafter should be taken as the amount of its\noriginal cost  reduced by  the amount  of deductions allowed\nunder Section  10(2) (xiv)  or s.35(2).	 In other words, the\ncontention of the assessee was and is that both the types of\nallowances are	permissible under  the statute except to the\nextent limited	by clauses  (d) and  (e) of  the proviso  to\nSection 10(2)  (xiv) of	 the  1922  Act	 and  reproduced  in\nclauses (iv) and (v) of	 Section 35(2) of the 1961 Act.\n     Before us	it is claimed on behalf of the assessee that\nthis interpretation  of the  statutory	provisions  is	very\nclear, patent  and unambiguous.	 It is	alleged that despite\nthis, some Income-tax Officers started disallowing the claim\nof depreciation	 in respect  of such  capital assets even in\nprevious years	during which  no deduction  was	 claimed  or\nallowed under Section 10(2) (xiv) or Section 35(2), contrary\nto the	clear language	of clause  (d) of  s.10(2) (xiv) and\ns.35(2) (iv). These Of orders were reversed on appeal either\nby the	Appellate Commissioner	or by  the Tribunal.  It was\nsuggested that	these decisions	 were almost  unanimously in\nfavour of  the assessee	 but the   department  persisted  in\npursuing the  matter upto  the stage of the High Court. Only\none reference  on this	topic came up before the High Courts\nand is	reflected in  the decision  of	the  Karnataka	High\nCourt, reported	 as CIT v. Indian Telephone Industries Ltd.,\n(1980) 126 I.T.R. 528. This was a reference of the year 1977\nmade at	 the instance  of the Commissioner of Income Tax and\nthe Commissioner of Income Tax lost this reference. The High\n(Sourt	re-affirmed   the  position  contended	for  by	 the\nassessee as  the one and only possible interpretation of the\nstatutory provisions. It is, therefore, contended that there\nwas, and  could have  been, no	doubt that  an assessee	 was\nentitled to  claim depreciation allowance in respect of such\nassets in  respect of  previous years  other than  those  in\nwhich an  allowance   had been allowed under the other head.\nWe shall revert later to this aspect of the matter.\n     At this stage, the Finance (No.2) Act, 1980 intervened.\nIt amended section 35(2) (iv) to read as follows:\n     \"(iv) where  a deduction is allowed\n     for any  previous year  under  this\n     section in	 respect of  expenditure\n     represented wholly	 or partly by an\n     asset,  no	  deduction   shall   be\n     allowed   under clauses  (i),  (ii)\n     and (iii)	of  sub-section	 (1)  of\n     section 32	 for  the  same	 or  any\n     other previous  year in  respect of\n     that asset.\"\n		      (Emphasis added)\n     The  Finance  Act	made  this  amendment  retrospective\nw.e.f. 1.4.62,	that is, the date of the commencement of the\n1961 Act.  This amendment is undoubtedly far-reaching in its\neffect.	 It   will  result  in	completion  of	the  pending\nassessments of	several years  on the  footing	of  the	 new\nprovision. It  will also involve re-opening or rectification\nof completed  assessments of  earlier years,  to the  extent\npermissible under the provisions of sections 148 and 154, in\ncases where  assessees had  been granted  \"double allowance\"\naccepting their	 contention at	the  time  of  the  original\nassessments. The  effect will be not for one assessment year\nbut for a number of assessment years in succession. Painting\na very	grim picture  of the  consequences  of	giving	full\nretrospective effect  to the  amendment, the  assessees	 say\nthat it will impose unexpected and impossible burden on them\nover the  years. jeopardise their solvency and lay them open\nto action  by creditor	and financial  institutions. Such an\nonerous burden, it is said. is unreasonable\nand  oppressive	 and  the  provision  imposing	such  burden\nviolates the  fundamental  rights  of  the  assessees  under\nArticles 14  and 19(1)	(g) of the Constitution of India. It\nis on  this plea  that, even  though assessments and appeals\nare pending in several of these cases, the petitioners chose\nto approach  this Court	 by  way  of  writ  petitions  under\nArticle 32  of	the  Constitution.  These  are	mostly	writ\npetitions of the year 1981 and are now coming up for hearing\nafter a period of 10 years.\n     Learned counsel  for the  assessees do  not contest the\ncompetence  of	 the  legislature   to	enact  the  impugned\nprovision, nor	do they dispute the right of the legislature\nto give	 retrospective effect  to statutory  provisions. The\ncontention only	 is that  retrospective	 provisions  may  be\npermissible   even in  taxing statutes	in  certain  special\ncircumstances such  as in  the case of provisions clarifying\nthe  impact   of  a  statute,  provisions  curing  defective\nlegislations in	 the light of the judicial decisions and the\nlike. They,  however, say that if the legislature chooses to\nimpose a  totally new  burden,	which  was  not	 at  all  in\ncontemplation	earlier	   and	 proceeds   to	 give	full\nretrospective effect  thereto, such  an	 attempt  should  be\nstruck	down   as    unreasonable  and	discriminatory.	 The\nprincipal questions, therefore, for our consideration are:\n     1)	 Were	the  earlier   statutory\n     provisions capable	 of  only    one\n     interpretation, namely, that placed\n     by the  assessees or  was there any\n     ambiguity in relation thereto ?\n     (2) If  there  was	 some  doubt  or\n     ambiguity	 about	  the	 earlier\n     legislation,  and	 the  1980   Act\n     clarified	 the   position	  by   a\n     retrospective amendment,  would  it\n     offend  the   provisions	of   the\n     Constitution ?\n     (3) If,  on  the  other  hand,  the\n     earlier provision	was  very  clear\n     and    capable    of    only    one\n     interpretation, as	 placed	 by  the\n     assessee,	 was   the   legislature\n     within its	 rights in  amending the\n     provision	retrospectively	  w.e.f.\n     1.4.62   and   thus   imposing   an\n     unreasonable  tax	 burden	 on  the\n     assessees?\n     Taking up	the first  of the three questions, it has to\nbe considered  from two	 angles, one  factual and the other,\nlegal. An  attempt was	made on behalf of the petitioners to\nproject an  image as  if the  interpretation  sought  to  be\nplaced by  the department on pre-1980 provisions to disallow\ndepreciation on such assets was so far-fetched that it never\nreceived the  approval of  the higher appellate authorities.\nIt was	suggested that	the appeals by assessees against the\ndisallowance invariably	 succeeded and it was the Department\nthat had  to move  the High Court on reference, the first of\nwhich references came up before the Karnataka High Court in\nC.l.T. v.  Indian Telephone  Industries	 (1980)	 126  I.T.R.\n548 and was answered against the Department. On the basis of\nsuch allegations  the petitioners attempted to make out that\nthe Department&apos;s  interpretation was  patently untenable and\nthat the  1980 amendment is not in the nature of a statutory\nclarification of  an ambiguity	but a  totally new and fresh\nimposition sought  to be  unjustifiably given  retrospective\neffect.\n     But, as Shri B.B. Ahuja has pointed out on the basis of\nthe averments  of the  petitioner in one of the cases, viz.,\nW.P.1153/81, the  impression sought  to be  created  by	 the\npetitioners does  not accord  with the	correct	 facts.	 The\nposition in  the case  is available  only as it stood at the\ntime when  the writ  petition and the counter affidavit were\nfiled	and   subsequent   developments	  are	not   known.\nNevertheless, the  picture that	 emerges is  this.  In	that\ncase, the  Income-tax  Officer	(I.T.O.)  is  said  to	have\nallowed depreciation on assets used for scientific research,\nfor the	 assessment year  1969-70, though  this is denied by\nthe department.	 The claim  was perhaps	 disallowed  by	 the\nI.T.O. for the assessment year 1970-71, but it was allowed\nby the	Allahabad Bench of the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal\n(I.T.A.T.) by  its order  dated 30.8.76.  For the assessment\nyear 1971-72,  the I.T.O.  disallowed the  depreciation. The\nAppellate Assistant  Commissioner (A.A.C.)  allowed it.	 The\ndepartment appealed to the Delhi Bench of the I.T.A.T. which\naccepted the department&apos;s plea by its order dated 13.8.79\n placing  reliance on the decision of a Special Bench of the\nI.T.A.T. It  has been  stated that  the	 assessee  filed  an\napplication for	 reference  to	the  High  Court  which	 was\npending when the writ petition was filed. For the assessment\nyears 1972-73  to 1974-75,  the assessments are pending as a\nstay order  had been  obtained for  reasons  which  are	 not\nknown. For  the assessment  years 1975-76  and 1976-77,	 the\nassessee claimed  depreciation	on  a  number  of  items  of\nscientific research  assets. The I.T.O. \"allowed\" the claims\nsubject to  the rider  that \"there  is no  provision to give\ndeduction of  more than	 100% of  the expenditure  by way of\ndepreciation\". The  assessee  appealed	to  Commissioner  of\nIncome-tax (Appeals)  who disallowed the claim. For 1977-78,\nthe l.T.O. disallowed the claim and the C.l.T. dismissed the\nassessee&apos;s appeals. For assessment years 1978-79 to 1980-81,\nthe assessments	 are stated  to be  pending. The above facts\nare sufficient to show that, atleast after 1.4.1968, - there\nis no  information before  us as  to  the  position  between\n1.4.1946 and  31.3.1968 -  the Department  has been  putting\nforward its  objections on  the issue  and that the same was\nthe subject  matter  of	 controversy  at  various  appellate\nstages, some  decided in  favour of,  and some	against, the\nassessee. A Special Bench of the l.T.A.T. had indeed decided\nthe issue  against the	assessee. In  this background, it is\nnot correct  to say  that the position was crystal clear and\nthat, save  for a  few ITOs  who took  a biassed  view,	 the\nauthorities were  all agreed that the Department&apos;s stand was\nuntenable. Some	 of the	 reported decisions  also show	that\nthere was  a live  controversy and that references have been\nmade to	 the  High  Court  both	 at  the  instances  or	 the\nassessees [see	Alkali &amp;  Chemical Corporation of India Ltd.\nv. C.l.T. (1986) 161 I.T.R. 820 (Cal.), and C.I.T. v. Indian\nExplosives Ltd.,  (1992) 192  I.T.R. 144 (Cal.)], as well as\nat the instance of the Revenue [see, C.I.T. v. International\nInstruments P. Ltd., (1983) 144 I.T.R. 936 (Kar.); C.I.T. v.\nMahindra Sintered Products Ltd. (1986) 161 I.T.R. 692 (Bom.)\nand Warner  Hindustan Ltd.  v. CIT,  (1988) 171	 I.T.R.	 224\n(A.P.)]. The petitioner&apos;s contention that, under the\n pre-amended  provisions, depreciation	on such	 assets	 was\nrecognised  allround   as  clearly  allowable  is  therefore\nrejected. We  have dealt  with this  aspect only  to meet an\naspect that  was urged. What is really important is the true\nand correct  interpretation of	those provisions,  not	what\nsomeone thought	 of it	then and to this aspect we shall now\nturn.\n \n     The second	 aspect of  the First of the three questions\nposed  earlier	 for  our  consideration  is  the  legal  or\ninterpretational aspect	 of the	 provisions  as	 they  stood\nprior to  the 1980  Amendment. Under  the provisions  of the\nstatute as  they stood	earlier, could	the  assessees	have\nclaimed continued  grant of depreciation after the expiry of\nfive previous  years before the 1968 amendment and after the\nexpiry or  the first  year after  the 1968  amendment,	even\nthough the  entire cost of the capital asset in question had\nbeen allowed  to  be  written  off  completely	against	 the\nbusiness  profits  of  those  five  previous  years  or	 one\nprevious year  as the  case may	 be? We	 think the answer to\nthis question  must emphatically  be in the negative. In our\nview, it is impossible to conceive of the legislature having\nenvisaged  a   double  deduction  in  respect  of  the	same\nexpenditure, even  though it  is true  that the two heads of\ndeduction do  not  completely  overlap	and  there  is	some\ndifference in  the rationale  of the  two  deductions  under\nconsideration. On behalf of the assessees reliance is placed\non the	following circumstances to support a contention that\nthe statute  did not  intend one  deduction to	preclude the\nother :\n     (i) lt  is pointed	 out that  s.10(2) (xiv) of the 1922\nAct, was  inserted in  1946 consequent on the insertion of a\ncorresponding  provision   in  the   United  Kingdom.	That\nprovision, viz. s.20(4) of the U.K. Finance Act, 1944\n read thus :\n     (4) Where	a deduction  is	 allowed\n     for any  year under  this	 or  the\n     last preceding  section in	 respect\n     of expenditure   represented wholly\n     or	 partly	  by  any   assets,   no\n     deduction	 shall be  allowed under\n     any provisions  of	 the  Income-tax\n     Act other	than this  part of  this\n     Act in  respect of	 wear and  tear,\n     obsolescence,    depreciation    or\n     exceptional depreciation  of  these\n     assets for	 any year  of assessment\n     during any	 part of  which they are\n     used by  the person carrying on the\n     trade   for   scientific	research\n     related to the trade. \"\n	  (emphasis supplied)\n     The Indian provision, it is said, has made a deliberate\ndeparture from	the said  provision and	 limited the  bar of\ndepreciation only  to those  previous years  during which  a\ndeduction is allowed under S.10(2) (xiv);\n     (ii) When	the Income-tax	Bill,  1961  was  under	 the\nconsideration of  the  Law  Commission,	 the  provisions  of\nS.10(2) (vi)  and (xiv) were carefully reviewed. But changes\nwere made  and the  provisions of the new Act in this regard\nwere drafted in pari materia with those of the old Act ;\n     (iii) The language used in clause (d) of the proviso to\nS.10(2)	 (xiv)	and  S.35(2)  (iv)  again  is  significantly\ndifferent from the language used in various other provisions\nof the	Act which,  in	like  contexts	of  possible  double\nallowances, emphatically  rule out  deductions in respect of\nthe same expense or exemptions in respect of the same income\nunder two  different provisions	 for the  same or  even	 any\nother assessment  year :  See, for  example, Sections  20(2)\n35B(2), 35C(2), 35CC(4), 35CCA(3), 35CCB(3), 35D(b), 35E(8),\n80GGA(4), 80HH(9A), 80HHA(7) and 80HHB(S); and\n     (iv) When the relevant provisions say that depreciation\nshall not be allowed in certain previous years, it permits a\ndisallowance only  in those  previous years  and  means,    The seeds of the present controversy were sown as early as in 1946. It is unfortunate that this matter should be coming up before this Court for its consideration nearly five decades later, though it must be pointed out that the issue in its present form is the outcome of an amendment made by the Finance (No.2) Act, 1980 (hereinafter referred to as \'the 1980 Act\') to the Income Tax Act, 1961* (hereinafter referred to as \'the 1961 Act\'). It is also a curious co-incidence that the 1980 Act effected two amendments in the 1961 Act with retrospective effect and the validity of both these provisions have been challenged before the courts. The first was the controversy with regard to the retrospective amendment of s.80-J which was settled by this Court by its decision in Lohia Machines Limited v. Union of India, (1985) 152 I.T.R. 308 (SC). It is the second amendment to the provisions contained in section 35(2) of the 1961 Act that has given rise to the present controversy between the parties.\r\n\r\nheld: So far as the arguments of taking away of vested rights is concerned, it is evident from the facts stated in the writ petition 1153/81 - which was treated as representative of the facts and contentions in all the writ petitions and with reference to which facts were arguments addressed itself that none of the assessments relating to any of the assessment years concerned herein has become final. They are pending at one or the other stage and in one or the other forum. I need not dilate upon this aspect inasmuch as the impugned amendment merely makes explicit what was implicit in the unamended clause, as explained hereinabove. In such a situation, the argument of any right vesting in the assessees is misplaced.\r\n\r\nThe writ petitions accordingly fail and are dismissed. No costs.\r\n\r\nPetitions  was dismissed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ','Sachalmal Parasram Vs Ratnabai And Ors. JUDGMENT S.M. Sikri, C.J.\r\n\r\n1. This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh dismissing the appeal filed by the appellant before us. The relevant facts for the determination of the points raised before us are as follows :\r\n\r\n2. Respondents Nos. 1, 2 and 3, who were the owners of the premises in dispute, mortgaged the premises in favour of respondent No. 4, with possession. Vide two mortgage deeds dated December 5, 1947 and October 26, 1948, for the amounts of 12,000/-and Rs. 4,000/- respectively. The date of payment was October 8, 1952, but by a subsequent agreement dated November 18, 1952, this was extended. The agreement further provided as follows :\r\n\r\nThe portion of the house in your side shall remain with you at a rental of Rs. 50/- per month. It was with you previously at Rs. 43/- per month. We shall not be responsible for any decrease or increase in the rental thereof. You shall have the right to let out the half portion of the shop on your side to any person at full rent\r\n\r\nOn May 1, 1958 respondent No. 4, the mortgagee in possession, filed a suit for foreclosure. During the pendency of this suit he let out the premises to the appellant at Rs. 55/- per month. It was provided in the rent agreement between the mortgagee and the appellant that &quot;incase the owner of the house gets the house released from mortgage under us, then I shall get the house vacated for you and hand it over to you.&quot; On September 28, 1960, a compromised decree for redemption was passed. The mortgagors, in execution of the said compromise decree, sought to take possession of the premises in dispute, which had been rented to the appellant. The appellant&#39;s objections under Order 21 Rule 97, CPC, were ultimately disallowed by the High Court, in revision, on April 18, 1964. The appellant then filed the present suit under Order 21, Rule 103, CPC for a declaration that &quot;the plaintiff (appellant) being the tenant of defendants Nos. 1, 2 and 3 (respondents) cannot be evicted unless eviction proceedings are taken against him under M.P. Premises Control Act.&quot; In the alternative, the appellant prayed for a declaration that &quot;if the plaintiff is considered to be the tenant of deft No. 4 even after the redemption decree the plaintiff cannot be evicted. He also prayed for a consequential permanent injunction. The Trial Court dismissed the suit. An appeal before the Additional District Judge also failed. As already mentioned, the second appeal before the High Court also failed.\r\n\r\n3. The learned Counsel for the appellant submitted that respondent No. 4, being the mortgagee in possession, had the right to let the premises in dispute both under Section 76 of the Transfer of Property Act, and under the agreement dated November 18, 1952. According to him, this act was an act prudent management and was binding on the respondents Nos. 1, 2 and 3. He further contended that he was protected by the provisions of the Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Control Act, 1961, and could not be evicted except in accordance with the provisions of that Act.\r\n\r\n4. The points raised by Mr. Naunit Lal are concluded by the decision of this Court in All India Film Corporation Ltd. v. Sri Rajagyan Nath : , which decision was unfortunately not brought to our notice during the course of the hearing. In this case the facts were similar. A mortgagee in possession had let out the premises, which was a cinema house, and the lessee had further sublet the same, to sub-les Sections On redemption the purchaser\r\n Property - Mortgage - Section 76(a) of Transfer of Property Act, 1882 - High Court expelled Appeal documented by Appellant for assertion that Plaintiff being an occupant can not be removed unless ousting procedures are taken against him and furthermore petitioned God for significant lasting directive - Hence, this Appeal - Whether, demonstration of rent was not demonstration of judicious administration - Held, long rent on such little lease was not demonstration of reasonability - However, Section 76(a) of Act expressed that demonstrations done genuine and wisely in common course of administration bound even after end of title of mortgagee under lock and key - Moreover, lease deed itself stipulated that renter would empty house and hand over same to Respondent on the off chance that proprietor of House got house discharged from home loan - There was no landowner and no inhabitant - Therefore arrangements of Rent Restriction Act couldn&#39;t matter - Appeal rejected.\r\n Disposed off','Hira Lal Rattan Lal Etc.

They  raise\ncommon questions of law for decision, and they are  directed\nagainst a common judgment of the Allahabad High Court.\nThe  facts  of the case lie within a  narrow  compass.	 The\nappellants  are dealers in foodgrains including cereals	 and\npulses	especially  split or processed foodgrains  and	dal.\nThe dispute in this case centers round the question  whether\nthe  Government	 is  competent	to  levy  sales-tax  on	 the\npurchases   made  by  the  appellants  of  split   processed\nfoodgrains  and	 dal  under the	 provisions  of	 the  United\nProvinces  Sales  Tax  Act, 1948 as  amended  by  the  Uttar\nPradesh	 Sales Tax Act (Amendment and Validation) Act,	1970\n(which will hereinafter be referred to as the Act).\nUnder  the Sales Tax Act as it originally stood	 which	will\n-hereinafter  be  referred  to as the  principal  Act),	 the\npurchases  of  split  or processed  foodgrains	and  dal  by\ndealers	 were sought, to be brought to tax under s.  3-D  of\nthe  principal Act read with the notification  issued.	 The\nvalidity  of the levy was challenged by Tilock Chand  Prasan\nKumar,	the appellant in Civil Appeal NO&apos;. 1625 of  1971  in\nrespect	 of  the assessment made on him for  the  assessment\nyear  1966-67  by assessment order dated June  30,  1968  by\nmeans of a writ petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution.\nThe  High  Court of Allahabad struck down the  levy  holding\nthat the dal purchased by the petitioner before it could not\nbe  said  to be a commodity essentially different  from	 the\narhar  dal  purchased by the dal mills and  accordingly	 the\npurchases effected by the petitioner could not be  regarded\nas  the first purchases.  This decision is reported  in	 25,\nS.T.C.	p. 118.	 Thereafter the Governor of U.P.  issued  an\nordinance  known as Uttar Pradesh Sales Tax  (Amendment	 and\nValidation) Ordinance, 1970 (U.P. Ordinance\n \nNo. 2 of 1970) adding inter alia Explanation 11 to s. 3-D as\nwell as s. 7 to the principal Act.  This ordinance was later\non  enacted  as	 an  Act  to  which  we	 have  already	made\nreference.  The provisions of the Amending Act are identical\nwith the provisions in the Ordinance.  Though at the time of\nthe  institution  of  the writ petitions  from	which  these\nappeals arise, the Ordinance had not yet been made into	 the\nAct, the Amending Act came into force during the pendency of\nthe writ petitions.  Hence we shall refer to the  provisions\nof the Amending Act.\n	      Under the principal Act a dealer is defined in\n	      s.  2(c)	as \" \"dealer\" means  any  person  or\n	      association   of	persons	 carrying   on	 the\n	      business	of buying or selling goods in  Uttar\n	      Pradesh, whether for commission,	remuneration\n	      or  otherwise, and includes any firm or  Hindu\n	      Joint   Family  and  any	society,   club	  or\n	      association  which sells goods to its  members\n	      and also includes any department of the  State\n	      Government  or  the Central  Government  which\n	      carries  on such business and any	 undertaking\n	      engaged  in the generation or distribution  of\n	      electrical energy or any other form of power.\"\n	      (Explanation  to the section is  not  relevant\n	      for our present purpose).\n	      Section 3 of the Act provides for the levy  of\n	      multi-point tax.	The portion of that  section\n	      which  is	 material for  our  present  purpose\n	      reads :\n	      \"Subject to the provisions of this Act,  every\n	      dealer shall, for each assessment year, pay a\n	      lax at the rate of two naye paise per rupee on\n	      his  turnover  of such year,  which  shall  be\n	      determined   in	such  manner   as   may	  be\n	      prescribed\"\n	      Section  3-A  provides  for  a  single   point\n	      taxation in respect of sale of certain  goods.\n	      At  present we are only concerned with  s.  3-\n	      D(1).  It provides :\n	      \"Except as provided in sub-section (2),  there\n	      shall be levied and paid, for each  assessment\n	      year  or part thereof, a tax on the  turnover,\n	      to  be  determined in such manner	 as  may  be\n	      prescribed,  of  first  purchases	 made  by  a\n	      dealer  or  through  a  dealer,  acting  as  a\n	      purchasing  agent in respect of such goods  or\n	      class  of	 goods,	 and  at  such	rates,	 not\n	      exceeding	 two paise per rupee in the case  of\n	      foodgrains, including cereals and pulses,	 and\n	      five  paise  per rupee in the  case  of  other\n	      goods and with effect from such date, as	may,\n	      from  time to time, be notified by the,  State\n	      Government in this behalf.\"\n	      (Explanation 1 to this section is not relevant\n	      for our purpose).\n \nThe notification issued under s. 3-D of the principal Act on\nOctober	 1,  1964 (Notification No. S. T.  7122/X)  provided\nthat  with  effect  from October 1, 1964,  the	turnover  of\npurchases  in  respect of goods mentioned therein  shall  be\nliable to tax under s. 3-D at the rate mentioned:\n\"Foodgrains    1.5 paise per rupee on first purchase\nOn  the	 basis	of s. 3-D read	with  the  notification,  as\nmentioned  earlier, the authorities under the Act sought  to\nbring to tax under the principal Act the first purchases  of\nprocessed  or split foodgrains including dal on	 the  ground\nthat  they constituted a separate item of  foodgrains  quite\nindependent  of the unprocessed or unsplit foodgains.	This\nview, as seen above, was negatived by the High Court.  After\nthe  decision  of  the High Court,  the	 principal  Act	 was\namended.   Under  the.	Amending Act  one  more	 Explanation\nviz., Explanation 11 was added to s. 3-D.\n	      \"For  the purposes of this sub-section,  split\n	      or  processed foodgrains, such as in the	form\n	      of  dal shall be deemed to be  different	from\n	      unsplit	or   unprocessed   foodgrains,	 and\n	      accordingly, nothing in this sub-section shall\n	      be  construed to prevent the imposition,	levy\n	      or  collection  of the tax in respect  of	 the\n	      first   purchases	  of  split   or   processed\n	      foodgrains  merely because. tax had  been	 im-\n	      posed  levied or collected earlier in  respect\n	      of the first purchases of those foodgrains  in\n	      their unsplit or unprocessed form.\"\n	      The  Amending  Act  also	added  a  validating\n	      provision to the principal Act viz. s. 7. That\n	      section reads :\n	      \"Notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order\n	      of  any  court or tribunal  to  the  contrary,\n	      every  notification  issued or  purporting  to\n	      have been issued under Section 3-A or  Section\n	      3-D  of  the  principal Act  before  the	com-\n	      mencement of this Act shall be deemed to	have\n	      been  issued under that section as amended  by\n	      this  Act and shall be so interpreted  and  be\n	      deemed to be and always to have been as  valid\n	      as if the provisions of this Act were in force\n	      at   all	material  times;   and	 accordingly\n	      anything	done or any action taken  (including\n	      any order made, proceeding taken, jurisdiction\n	      exercised,  assessment  made, or	tax  levied,\n	      collected or paid purporting to have been done\n	      or   taken   in	pursuance   of	 any	such\n	      notification)  shall  be	deemed	to  be,	 and\n	      always to have been, validly and lawfully done\n	      or taken.\"\n	      It will be necessary later on to consider what\n	      was the vice that the legislature intended  to\n	      cure by the Amending Act.	 The\n	      --L498Sup Cl/73\n \n	      sequence	 of  events  itself  discloses	 the\n	      purpose  of  the	Ordinance  as  well  as	 the\n	      Amending	Act.  That apart, the  statement  of\n	      objects  and  reasons which  can	be  usefully\n	      looked  into  for the purpose of	finding	 the\n	      vice  that  the  legislature  was	 trying	  to\n	      provide against reads thus\n	      \"Sections	 3-A and 3-D of the U.P.  Sales	 Tax\n	      Act,  1948 provide for single point  taxation.\n	      Under the fondler section the tax is levied on\n	      the turnover of sales, while under the  latter\n	      the  tax	is levied on the turnover  of  first\n	      purchases.  Plain and ornamented glass bangles\n	      are subject to tax separately under section 3-\n	      A.   Similarly, unsplit and split	 pulses	 are\n	      separately  subject to tax under section	3-D.\n	      It has been held by the High Court in one case\n	      that tax cannot be levied separately on  plain\n	      and ornamented glass bangles under section 3-A\n	      and  in  another	that tax  cannot  be  levied\n	      separately  on unsplit and split pulses  under\n	      section  3-D  because in their  opinion  plain\n	      glass  bangles are not a	commodity  different\n	      from  ornamented glass bangles  and  similarly\n	      unsplit  pulses and split pulses are also	 not\n	      two  different commodities.   These  judgments\n	      have   created  legal  difficulties   in	 the\n	      assessment  and  collection  of  tax  on	 the\n	      aforesaid	 commodities.  Besides, the  dealers\n	      have  started applying for the refund  of	 tax\n	      already collected on these commodities.	Ibis\n	      will have serious repercussions on the State&apos;s\n	      revenue.	Accordingly, it is proposed to amend\n	      sections	3-A and 3-D to provide for the	levy\n	      of   tax	on  the	 aforesaid  commodities	  as\n	      separate	items.	 It  is	 also  proposed	  to\n	      validate	 the  past  levy,   assessment	 and\n	      collection of tax on the above commodities.\"\n	      (The  remaining  part  of	 the  statement	  of\n	      objects  and reasons is not relevant  for	 our\n	      present purpose).\n	      The  appellants  challenged  the	validity  of\n	      Explanation  11  of  S. 3-D as well  as  s.  7\n	      introduced by the Amending Act before the High\n	      Court of Allahabad in petitions under Art. 226\n	      of  the Constitution.  They further  took	 the\n	      plea that the amendments incorporated were not\n	      effective	 enough	 to bring to tax  the  first\n	      purchases of split or processed foodgrains and\n	      pulses.	 The  High  Court   rejected   these\n	      contentions and dismissed the writ  petitions.\n	      Thereafter  these	 appeals have  been  brought\n	      after  obtaining	certificates from  the	High\n	      Court.\n	      The  validity  of	 the levy  in  question	 was\n	      challenged on the following grounds&apos;:\n	      (1)   That  no fresh levy can be imposed by  a\n	      retrospective legislation;\n \n	      (2)   That  the legislature cannot in case  of\n	      legislation  of the nature with which  we	 are\n	      concerned,    separate	into	 independent\n	      commodities   split  and	unsplit	 pulses	  or\n	      processed	 or unprocessed pulses and  on	that\n	      footing  seek to impose tax twice over on	 the\n	      same commodity in respect of the goods  liable\n	      to be taxed at a single point;\n	      (3)   That  the newly added Explanation to  s.\n	      3-D read with s. 7 of the Amending Act amounts\n	      to an unlawful usurpation of judicial power by\n	      the legislature;\n	      (4)   The newly added Explanation II to s. 3-D\n	      is violative of Art. 14 of the  Constitution\n	      There  is	 no rational  basis  for  separating\n	      split  or	 processed pulses  from	 unsplit  or\n	      unprocessed pulses;\n	      (5)   On a true construction of Explanation It\n	      to s. 3-D no fresh charge can be held to	have\n	      been imposed,\n	      (6)   No	levy  of purchase tax  can  be	made\n	      without a fresh Notification under s. 3-D read\n	      with Explanation 11 showing therein separately\n	      foodgrains  unsplit or unprocessed as well  as\n	      foodgrains split or processed; and\n	      (7)   That   the	 power	conferred   on	 the\n	      Government   under  s.  3-D  amounts   to	  an\n	      excessive delegation of legislative power. and\n	      consequently void.\nThe  source  of	 the  legislative power	 to  levy  sales  or\npurchase  tax  on goods is Entry 54 of the List	 II  of	 the\nConstitution.	 It   is  well	settled	 that	subject	  to\nconstitutional restrictions a power to legislate includes  a\npower to legislate prospectively as well as retrospectively.\nIn this regard legislative power to impose tax also includes\nwithin	itself	the power to  tax  retrospectively--see	 The\nUnion of India v. Madan Gopal Kabra;(1) M. P.  Sundararamier\n&amp;  Co. v. The State of Andhra Pradesh and Anr. (2) ;  J.  K.\nJute Mills Co. Ltd. v. The State of Uttar Pradesh and  Anr.;\n(3) Chhotabhai Jethabhai Patel and Co. v. The Union of India\nand Anr. (4 Sri Ramkrishna &amp; Ors. v. The State of Bihar. (5)\nIn the last mentioned case it was specifically decided	that\nwhere  the legislature can make a valid law, it can  provide\nnot  only  for	the prospective operation  of  the  material\nprovisions  of the said law but it can also provide for	 the\nretrospective operation of the said provisions.\nWe see no force in the second contention advanced on  behalf\nof  the	 appellants.  As seen earlier the  general  rule  as\nenunciated in s. 3 is multi point tax sales tax or  purchase\ntax; but power\n(1) [1954] S. C. R. 541.\n(2)  [1958] S. C. R. 1422.\n(3)  12.

Legislature  was	 not  incompetent  to  separate	 the\nprocessed  or split pulses from the unsplit  or	 unprocessed\npulses and treat the two as separate and independent goods.\nIn  Jagannath and Ors. v. Union of India,(1) question  arose\nfor  decision  whether	it was open to	the  legislature  to\nimpose	separate excise duty on tobacco leaf as well  as  on\nbroken leaf of tobacco.	 This Court overruled the contention\nthat  such a levy was invalid. It head that it was open	 for\nthe legislature to separate the two items.  We see no  basis\nfor  the  contention  that the legislature  cannot  for	 the\npurpose of tax under the Act separate the split or processed\nPulses	from the unsplit or unprocessed.  The power  of	 the\nlegislature  to specify the nature of the goods the sale  or\npurchase of which, it will bring to tax is very wide.\nNow coming to point No. 3, there is no justification for the\ncontention  that  the legislature has usurped  any  judicial\npower.	The legislature has not purported either directly or\nby  necessary implication to overrule the decisions  of	 the\nAllahabad  High.  Court in Tilok Chand Prasan  Kumar&apos;s	case\n(supra).   On the other hand it. has accepted tha Under the U.P.

The contest  before  us  is\nconfined  to the quantum of compensation and, although	Shri\nVasudeva Pillai, counsel for the appellants&apos; has pressed his\npoints	with persistence, we are unable to disturb the	High\nCourt&apos;s award.\nThe land, vast in extent, had a building with a plinth	area\nof  3,300 sq. yds.  The area in which the acquired  plot  is\nsituate	 is  perhaps an important one in  the  City.   After\ngetting	 expert	 valuation  made of  the  buildings  by	 the\nCentral	 Public	 Works Department engineers,  the  Collector\nawarded a sum of Rs. 41,674/- for the buildings, Rs. 1,440/-\nfor the standing trees and a sum of Rs. 30,630/for a belt of\nland  50  ft.  deep  at Rs. 15/- per  square  yard  and	 Rs.\n99,435/-  for  the remaining area of 13,258 sq.	 yds.	The,\ntotal figure together with statutory solarium granted by the\nCollector was Rs. 1,99,155.85. This figure fell far short of\nthe ambitious claim of the appellant and, when the case came\nbefore	the  City Civil Court on a reference, there  was  an\nenhancement   of   compensation.    Although   the   learned\nAdditional Chief Judge held that the area was a little	less\nthan had been determined by the Collector, the market  value\nof the building was increased nearly four fold on the  basis\nof  a multiple of 25 times the rent fetched.  On  the  other\nitems also some changes were made and, consequentially,	 the\ntotal  amount was raised to Rs. 3,31,092/-.   The  appellant\narrived	 in  the High Court asking for more (and  the  State\nalso appears to have appealed, but its appeal was  dismissed\nand we are not therefore concerned with it).\nSome  measure of good fortune attended the appeal since	 the\nHigh Court altered the multiple from 25 to 27 in fixing	 the\ncompensation for the building.	Otherwise, it  substantially\naffirmed the findings of the trial Court, except that to the\nadvantage  of the appellant it restored the  area  acquired.\nThe net result was the appellant obtained a total sum of Rs.\n3,52,326.65 as compensation.\nIt is thus clear that from the Collector to the Civil  Court\nand  on, to the High Court. there has been an escalation  in\nthe  amount  of compensation and, hopefully, the  owner	 has\nreached	 this  Court with his appeal,  under  a	 certificate\nwhich  he  secured under Art. 133(1)(a)	 before	 the  recent\namendment.  We mention this because we are unable to discern\nany  substantial  question of law of general  importance  in\ncounsel&apos;s   submissions	 or  the  points  outlined  in	 the\nmemorandum of appeal which merits the consideration of	this\nCourt.\n \nMerely	because the claim is large the judgment need not  be\nlong  :and,  although  the appellant tried  to	spread	the,\ncanvas	 wide,	 we   regard   the   points   deserving	  of\nconsideration-as  falling  within  a  narrow  compass.	 The\nburden	of  the song has been that Hyderabad has,  for	his-\ntorical	 reasons,  become  a great city and  that  the	land\nacquired has precious potential value which has not  entered\nthe  judicial computation at the lesser levels. (By  way  of\naside  one, may say that society economic development  of  a\nCity-  may  enhance  the  value of  space  without  any	 the\nlittlest contribution by its owner and it is, in one  sense,\nunfair	that  society should pay to an individual  a  higher\nprice  not  because he has-earned it but  because  of  other\ndevelopmental factors.	Of course, we are concerned with the\nLand  Acquisition  Act as it is and this  thought  therefore\nneed not be pursued).  Counsel has also urged that the	land\nand the building taken together had a personality of its own\nand  therefore a special value, missed by the courts  below,\nshould	be ascribed and the methodology of breaking  up	 the\ntotality  into	buildings  and	lands  separately  This appeal, by certificate, arises out of land acquisition proceedings under the Hyderabad Land Acquisition Act (Hyderabad Act IX of 1309 Fasli) (hereinafter called the Act, for short) which substantially resembles the provisions of the Central Land Acquisition Act. The Government of Andhra Pradesh acquired a large open area with some buildings thereon by Notification, dated January 3, 1957 with a view to construct Income-tax add Central Excise Offices at Hyderabad. The contest before us is confined to the quantum of compensation and, although Shri Vasudeva Pillai, counsel for the appellants\' has pressed his points with persistence, we are unable to disturb the High Court\'s award. The land, vast in extent, had a building with a plinth area of 3,300 sq. yds. The area in which the acquired plot is situate is perhaps an important one in the City. After getting expert valuation made of the buildings by the Central Public Works Department engineers, the Collector awarded a sum of Rs. 41,674/- for the buildings, Rs. 1,440/- for the standing trees and a sum of Rs. 30,630/for a belt of land 50 ft. deep at Rs. 15/- per square yard and Rs. 99,435/- for the remaining area of 13,258 sq. yds. The, total figure together with statutory solarium granted by the Collector was Rs. 1,99,155.85. This figure fell far short of the ambitious claim of the appellant and, when the case came before the City Civil Court on a reference, there was an enhancement of compensation. Although the learned Additional Chief Judge held that the area was a little less than had been determined by the Collector, the market value of the building was increased nearly four fold on the basis of a multiple of 25 times the rent fetched. On the other items also some changes were made and, consequentially, the total amount was raised to Rs. 3,31,092/-. The appellant arrived in the High Court asking for more (and the State also appears to have appealed, but its appeal was dismissed and we are not therefore concerned with it). Some measure of good fortune attended the appeal since the High Court altered the multiple from 25 to 27 in fixing the compensation for the building. Otherwise, it substantially affirmed the findings of the trial Court, except that to the advantage of the appellant it restored the area acquired. The net result was the appellant obtained a total sum of Rs. 3,52,326.65 as compensation. It is thus clear that from the Collector to the Civil Court and on, to the High Court. there has been an escalation in the amount of compensation and, hopefully, the owner has reached this Court with his appeal, under a certificate which he secured under Art. 133(1)(a) before the recent amendment. Court mention this because court is unable to discern any substantial question of law of general importance in counsel\'s submissions or the points outlined in the memorandum of appeal which merits the consideration of this Court.\r\n\r\nHeld: Court is satisfied with the valuation of the rented portion of the house adopted by the High Court is correct. Shri Pillai argued in vain for an augmentation of the value on the potential user of the plot for a Cinema House. This story has been factually disbelieved by the Courts below and we cannot reopen the matter. Court must also remember that the Court below has been indulgent enough to adopt a multiple of 27 despite the fact that the buildings acquired are over 30 years old. Nor does it come with grace from the appellant to contend against the belting method since he himself had asked for its application before the Collector and the trial Court.\r\n\r\nCourt is thus satisfied that there is no law, no fact, which comes to the rescue of the appellant and his appeal, virtually against concurrent findings of fact, therefore deserves to be, and is hereby, dismissed with costs. ','Daya Singh Lahoria Vs Union Of India And Ors With\nSpecial Leave Petition (Crl.) Nos. 2697-2698  of 2000.\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nPATTANAIK,J.\nLITTTTTTTJ\n\n    The Writ Petition and the Special Leave Petitions raised\nthe common question, and as such were heard together and are\ndisposed  of by this common judgment.  The grievance of	 the\npetitioner Daya Singh Lahoria, in the Writ Petition is, that\nthe  Criminal Courts in the country have no jurisdiction  to\ntry  in respect of offences which do not form a part of	 the\nextradition  judgment by virtue of which the petitioner	 has\nbeen  brought  to this country and he can be tried only	 for\nthe  offences  mentioned  in the  Extradition  Decree.	 The\npetitioner  has	 also  prayed for quashing of  the  FIR	 and\ncharge	sheet  against	him which are not  included  in	 the\nextradition judgment of the USA Court.	It appears, that the\nUnited	States District of Texas Fort Worth Division  issued\nthe  judgment  of certification of extraditability  and	 the\nsaid  decree  certifies to sustain under Extradition  Treaty\nbetween	 the  United  States  and  the	United	Kingdom	 and\nNorthern  Ireland  with the Government of Republic of  India\nand  specifies the offences for which the accused, mentioned\nin  the	 extradition  order  could  be	tried.	 It  is	 the\ncontention of the petitioner that he cannot be tried for the\noffences   other   than	 the   offences	 mentioned  in	 the\nextradition  order  as	that  would be	a  contravention  of\nSection	  21  of  the  Extradition   Act  as  well  as	 the\ncontravention of the provisions of the International Law and\nthe very Charter of Extradition Treaty.\n\n    The	 Special Leave Applications are directed against the\norder of Rajasthan High Court wherein the High Court refused\nto  entertain  a  Habeas  Corpus  Petition  and	 decide	 the\nquestion  as  to  the jurisdiction of the  Designated  Court\nunder  the  provisions	of   the  Terrorist  and  Disruptive\nActivities  (Prevention)  Act, 1987, on the ground  that  an\nobjection  to  the  said jurisdiction could  be	 made  under\nSection	 18 of the Act before the very Designated Court	 and\nan application for issuance of a Writ of Habeas Corpus would\nnot lie.  The question for consideration in the said Special\nLeave  Petitions,  therefore, is whether an accused, who  is\nbeing  tried  in respect of offences under  the	 Extradition\nTreaty	can  be tried for any other offence which  does	 not\nform  a part of the decree in view of the specific provision\ncontained in Section 21 of the Extradition Act, 1962.\n\n    To	consolidate  and  amend	 the  law  relating  to	 the\nextradition of fugitive criminals and to provide for matters\nconnected  therewith, or incidental thereto, the Extradition\nAct of 1962 has been enacted.  Prior to the enactment of the\naforesaid  law of extradition applicable to India was  found\nscattered in the United Kingdom Extradition Act of 1870, the\nFugitive Offenders Act, 1881 and the Indian Extradition Act,\n1903.	The expression extradition means, surrender by one\nState  to  another of a person desired to be dealt with	 for\ncrimes	 of  which  he	has   been  accused  and  which	 are\njusticiable  in the Courts of the other States.	 The  rights\nof  a  citizen	not to be sent out to  foreign	jurisdiction\nwithout	 strict compliance with law relating to	 extradition\nis  a valuable right.  This Extradition Act is a special law\ndealing	 with criminals and accused of certain crimes and it\nprescribes the procedure for trial as well as the embargo in\ncertain contingencies.	The expression extradition offence\nhas  been  defined in Section 2 (c) of the Act to  mean,  in\nrelation  to  a	 foreign  State, being a  treaty  State,  an\noffence	 punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall\nnot  be	 less than one year under the laws of India or of  a\nforeign	 State	and  includes  a  composite  offence.	 The\nexpression  extradition Treaty has been defined in Section\n2(d)  to  mean, a treaty (agreement or arrangement) made  by\nIndia  with  a foreign State relating to the extradition  of\nfugitive  criminals and includes any treaty relating to	 the\nextradition  of fugitive criminals made before the 15th	 day\nof August, 1947, which extends to, and is binding on, India.\nThe  expression	 foreign State is defined in Section  2(e)\nincludes   any	State  outside	 India	and  includes  every\nconstituent  part,  colony  or	dependency  of	such  State.\nSection	 21  of	 the  Extradition Act is  relevant  for	 our\npurpose.\n\n    Section  21, as it stood in the Extradition Act of	1962\nis extracted hereinbelow in extenso:\n\n    Section 21:	 Accused or convicted person surrendered or\nreturned  by foreign State or Commonwealth country not to be\ntried  for previous offence:- Whenever any person accused or\nconvicted  of an offence, which if committed in India, would\nbe  an extradition offence, is surrendered or returned by  a\nforeign	 State	or Commonwealth country, that  person  shall\nnot, until he has been restored or has had an opportunity of\nreturning to that State or country, be tried in India for an\noffence	 committed  prior to the surrender or return,  other\nthan  the  extradition offence proved by the facts on  which\nthe surrender or return is based.\n\n    This  section  is  based  on Section 19  of	 the  United\nKingdom Extradition Act, 1870.	The original Act of 1962 was\namended	 by  Act  66  of  1993.	   Under  the  1962  Act,  a\ndistinction   had  been	  maintained  between	Commonwealth\ncountries  and	foreign States and the foreign	States	were\nconsidered   as	 treaty	 States.    The	  extradition	with\nCommonwealth  countries	 were  separately  governed  by	 the\nSecond	Schedule  of the Act and the Central Government	 was\ngiven	power	under  Chapter	 III  to  conclude   special\nextradition   arrangements  with   respect  to	Commonwealth\ncountries  only.   The amended Act of 1993 enables India  to\nconclude  extradition  treaty with foreign State,  including\nthe   Commonwealth   countries,	   without   treating	them\nstructurally  different.  It provides for  extra-territorial\njurisdiction  over  foreigners for crimes committed by	them\noutside	 India and it incorporates composite offences in the\ndefinition  of	extradition offence.  It excludes  political\noffences  as  a	 defence in cases of offences of  a  serious\nnature	and  it covers extradition requests on the basis  of\ninternational  convention.   It	 also  enables	the  Central\nGovernment  to	make  and receive requests  for	 provisional\narrest	of fugitives in urgent cases pending the receipt  of\nthe  formal extradition request.  Section 21 of 1962 Act was\nsubstituted by Act 66 of 1993, as follows:\n\n\n    Section 21	Accused or convicted person surrendered or\nreturned  by  foreign  State  not to be	 tried	for  certain\noffences.   - Whenever any person accused or convicted of an\noffence,   which,  if  committed  in   India  would  be	  an\nextradition offence, is surrendered or returned by a foreign\nState,	such person shall not, until he has been restored or\nhas  had an opportunity of returning to that State, be tried\nin India for an offence other than.\n\n    (a)	 the extradition offence in relation to which he was\nsurrendered or returned;  or\n\n    (b) any lesser offence disclosed by the facts proved for\nthe  purposes of securing his surrender or return other than\nan  offence in relation to which an order for his  surrender\nor return could not be lawfully made;  or\n\n    (c)	 the  offence in respect of which the foreign  State\nhas given its consent.\n\n    The	  provision   of  the	aforesaid   Section   places\nrestrictions  on  the trial of the person extradited and  it\noperates  as a bar to the trial of the fugitive criminal for\nany  other  offence  until the condition of  restoration  or\nopportunity  to return is satisfied.  Under the amended	 Act\nof 1993, therefore, a fugitive could be tried for any lesser\noffence,  disclosed  by	 the facts proved or  even  for	 the\noffence	 in respect of which the foreign State has given its\nconsent.   It thus, enables to try the fugitive for a lesser\noffence, without restoring him to the State or for any other\noffence, if the State concerned gives its consent.  In other\nwords,	it may be open for our authorities to obtain consent\nof  the	 foreign  State to try the fugitive  for  any  other\noffence	 for  which  the extradition decree might  not	have\nmentioned,  but	 without obtaining such consent, it  is	 not\npossible  to  try  for	any other offence,  other  than	 the\noffence	 for which the extradition decree has been obtained.\nThe  Extradition  Treaty contains several articles of  which\nArticle	 7 is rather significant for our purpose, which	 may\nbe quoted hereinbelow in extenso:-\n\n    Article 7.	A person surrendered can in no case be kept\nin  custody or be brought to trial in the territories of the\nHigh  Contracting Party to whom the surrender has been	made\nfor  any other crime or offence, or on account of any  other\nmatters,  than	those for which the extradition	 shall	have\ntaken  place,  until  he has been restored, or	has  had  an\nopportunity  of	 returning, to the territories of  the	High\nContracting Party by whom he has been surrendered.\n\n    This  stipulation  does n Removal Act, 1962 - Section 21 - an outlaw brought into this nation under an Extradition Decree can be attempted just for the offenses specified in the Extradition Decree and for no other offense and the Criminal Courts of this nation will have no purview to attempt such outlaw for whatever other offense. ','State Of T.N Vs Ananthi Ammal The Judgmenttt of the Court was delivered by S.P. BHARUCHA, J.-\r\n\r\nCivil Appeal No. 3312 of 1981\r\n\r\n1.This appeal by special leave is filed by the State of Tamil Nadu against the judgment and order of the High Court of Madras dated 9-9-1981, where by the Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for Harijan Welfare Schemes Act, 1978, was struck down as being ultra vires the Constitution of India. The High Court came to the conclusion that the said Act did not enjoy the protection of Articles 31-C or 31-A and that it was violative of Articles 14, 19 and 300-A of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n2.Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the said Act was not violative of Article 14 or Article 19 or Article 300-A and that, in any event, it was protected by reason of Article 31 A. Learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the said Act was violative of Article 14 inasmuch as it was enacted to acquire lands for a purpose which could as well be served by the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, and that a comparison of the provisions of the said Act with those of the Land Acquisition Act showed that the provisions of the said Act were far harsher insofar as the landowner was concerned. Learned counsel for the respondents also submitted that the said Act did not enjoy the protection conferred by Article 31-C notwithstanding the declaration in that behalf contained in Section 2 thereof.\r\n\r\n3.The said Act contains in Section 2 the declaration aforementioned, namely, that it is enacted to give effect to the policy of the State towards securing the principles laid down in Part IV and, in particular, Article 46 of the Constitution. It is enacted to provide for acquisition of land for Harijan Welfare Schemes.\r\n\r\n4.Section 3 of the said Act is the definition section. It defines &#39;Court&#39; to mean, in the city of Madras, the Madras City Civil Court and elsewhere, the Subordinate Judge&#39;s Court having jurisdiction, and if there is no such Subordinate Judge&#39;s Court, the District Court having jurisdiction. A &quot;Harijan Welfare Scheme&quot; is defined to mean any scheme for provision of house sites for Harijans, for constructing, extending or improving any dwelling house for Harijans, for providing any burial or burning ground for Harijans, for providing any pathway leading to such dwelling house, burial or burning ground or for providing any other amenity for the benefit of Harijans. Sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the said Act read thus:\r\n\r\n&quot;4. Power to acquire land.- (1) Where the District Collector is satisfied that for the purpose of any Harijan Welfare Scheme, it is necessary to acquire any land, he may acquire the land by publishing in the District Gazette a notice to the effect that he has decided to acquire the land in pursuance of this section. (2)Before publishing a notice under sub- section (1), the District Collector or any officer authorised by the District Collector in this behalf, shall call upon the owner or any other person, who, in the opinion of the District Collector or the officer so authorised may be interested in such land, to show cause why it should not be acquired. (3)(a) The District Collector may, where he has himself called upon the owner or other person to show cause under sub-section (2), pass such orders as he may deem fit on the cause so shown;\r\n\r\n(b)Where any officer authorised by the District Collector has called upon the owner or other person to show cause under sub- section (2), the officer so authorised shall make a report to the District Collector containing his recommendations on the cause so shown for the decision of the District Collector. After considering such report the District Collector may pass such orders as he may deem fit.\r\n\r\n5.Land acquired to vest in Government free from all encumbrances.- When a notice under sub-section (1) of Section 4 is published in the District Gazette, the land to which the said notice relates shall, on and from the date on which the notice is so published vest absolutely in the Government free from all encumbrances.\r\n\r\n6.Right to receive amount.- Every person having any interest in any land acquired under this Act shall be entitled to receive and be paid an amount as hereinafter provided.\r\n\r\n7.Determination of amount.- (1) The amount payable in respect of any land acquired under this Act shall be the market value of such land on the date of publication of the notice under sub-section (1) of Section 4.&quot; Section 8 sets out the matters that are to be ignored in determining the amount under Section 7. Section 9 entitles any person who does not agree with the amount determined by the prescribed authority under Section 7(2) to prefer an appeal to the &#39;Court&#39; within such period as may be prescribed. Sub-section (1) of Section 10 requires the prescribed authority to determine who, in his opinion, are entitled to receive the amount where several persons claim to be interested therein and what is payable to each of them. Sub- section (2) states that where a dispute arises in this behalf the prescribed authority may refer it for the decision of the court and the court must, in deciding such dispute, follow the provisions of Part III of the Land Acquisition Act. Section 11 reads thus: &quot;11. Payment of amount.- (1) After the amount has been determined, the prescribed authority shall tender payment of the amount to the persons entitled thereto and shall pay it to them-\r\n\r\n(i)in a lump sum in a case where it does not exceed two thousand rupees,and\r\n\r\n(ii)in all other cases, in such number of equal annual instalments not exceeding five as may be determined by the prescribed authority and the amount of each such annual instalment shall not be less than two thousand rupees: Provided that where the balance of the amount due in any instalment is less than two thousand rupees, only the actual amount so due shall be paid.\r\n\r\n(2)If the persons entitled to the amount do not consent to receive it or if there be no person competent to alienate the land, or if there be any dispute as to the title to receive the amount, or as to the apportionment of it, the prescribed authority shall deposit the amount in the Court, and the Court shall deal with the amount so deposited in the manner laid down in Sections 32 and 33 of the Land Acquisition &#39;Act, 1894 (Central Act I of 1894).&quot;\r\n\r\nSection 12 provides for payment of interest. It says that when the compensation amount is not paid or deposited on or before taking possession of the land, the prescribed authority shall pay it with interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the time of taking possession until payment. Section 13 reads thus:\r\n\r\n&quot;13. Appeal to High Court.- Subject to the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Central Act V of 1908) applicable to appeals from original decrees, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any enactment for the time being in force, a second appeal shall lie to the High Court from any decision of the Court under this Act, if the amount as determined by the prescribed authority exceeds such sum as may be prescribed.&quot;\r\n\r\nSection 20 states that the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, save as provided in the said Act, shall cease to apply to any land which is required for the purpose specified in Section 4(1) and such land shall be acquired only in accordance with the provisions of the said Act. Section 22 reads thus:\r\n\r\n&quot;22. Application of the Act to certain pending cases of acquisition.- (1) The provisions of this Act shall apply also to any case or cases in which proceedings have been started before the commencement of this Act for the acquisition of any land for the Harijan Welfare Scheme under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (Central Act I of 1894) (hereinafter in this section referred to as the said Act) but no award has been made by the Collector under Section 11 of the said Act before such commencement, as if-\r\n\r\n(i) the notification published under sub- section (1) of Section 4 of the said Act, or\r\n\r\n(ii)the declaration made under Section 6 of the said Act, or\r\n\r\n(iii)the notice given under sub-section (1) of Section 9 of the said Act, were a notice to show cause against the acquisition of the land served under sub- section (2) of Section 4 of this Act. (2)Nothing contained in sub-section (1) shall apply in relation to any land unless and until after&#39; the District Collector has published a notice in the District Gazette to the effect that the said land is required for the purpose specified in sub-section (1) of Section 4 of this Act.&quot;\r\n\r\n5. It was submitted by learned counsel for the respondents that no enquiry as required by Section 5 of the Land Acquisition Act was contemplated by the said Act. Whereas it was the Government which was required to consider objections and the need for acquisition and make a declaration thereafter that the land was required for a public purpose under the Land Acquisition Act, it was, under the said Act, left to the District Collector to be satisfied that the land was required for the purpose of a Harijan Welfare Scheme. No enquiry into the value of the land was contemplated under the said Act inasmuch as a provision equivalent to Section 11 of the Land Acquisition Act was not to be found in the said Act.\r\n\r\nWhereas the Land Acquisition Act set out the matters that were required to be considered for the purposes of award of compensation there was no such provision in the said Act. The said Act did not provide for a reference to the court in regard to a claim for enhancement of compensation in the manner of Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act; it provided only for an appeal to the court and, having regard to the terms of Section 9, that appeal was restricted to the amount of solatium payable under Section 7(2) of the said Act. Section 11 of the said Act provided for the payment of the compensation amount in instalments in the event that the amount thereof exceeded Rs 2000. Section 13 of the said Act provided for a second appeal to the High Court only if the amount as determined by the prescribed authority exceeded such sum as might be prescribed. This sum, it may be mentioned, was at the relevant time Rs.50,000, which was the amount prescribed for the purposes of all second appeals to the High Court under the rules for the purpose.\r\n\r\n6. In State of M.P v. G.C. Mandawar1 a Constitution Bench held that Article 14 does not authorise the striking down of the law of one State on the ground that, in contrast with the law of another State on the same subject, its provisions are discriminatory, nor does it contemplate the law of the Centre or of a State dealing with similar subjects being held to be unconstitutional by a process of comparative study of the provisions of the two. The sources of authority for the two being different, Article 14 can have no application. In Sant Lal Bharti v. State of Punjab2 this was reiterated.\r\n\r\n7. When a statute is impugned under Article 14 what the court has to decide is whether the statute is so arbitrary or unreasonable that it must be struck down. At best, a statute upon a similar subject which derives its authority from another source can be referred to, if its provisions have been held to be reasonable or have stood the test of time, only for the purpose of indicating what may be said to be reasonable in the context. We proceed to examine the provisions of the said Act upon this basis.\r\n\r\n8. Sub-section (1) of Section 4 empowers the District Collector, if he is satisfied that it is necessary to acquire some land for the purpose of a Harijan Welfare Scheme, to acquire that land by publishing in the District Gazette a notice to the effect that he has decided to acquire it in pursuance of Section 4. Sub-section (2) of Section 4 obliges the District Collector or any officer authorised by him in this behalf to call upon the owner or any other person who, in the opinion of the District Collector or the officer so authorised, is interested in such land to show cause why it should not be acquired. Where the District Collector has called upon the owner or other person to show cause under sub-section (2), clause (a) of sub-section (3) requires him to pass orders on the cause so shown. Where an officer authorised by the District Collector has called upon the owner or other person to show cause under sub-section (2), clause (b) of Section 3 requires that officer to report to the District Collector his recommendations on the cause so shown and the 1 (1955) 1 SCR 599 AIR 1954 SC 493 2 (1988) 1 SCC 366 (1988) 2 SCR 107 District Collector is required to pass such orders as he may deem fit after considering the report. Sub-section (2) of Section 4, therefore, obliges the acquiring authority to serve notice upon the landowner and other persons interested in the land to show cause why it should not be acquired. By reason of sub-section (3) of Section 4, such cause has to be taken into account and orders passed in respect thereof. It is only thereafter that the acquiring authority can arrive at the satisfaction that it is necessary to acquire the land. The provisions of Section 4, therefore, substantially encapsulate the provisions of Sections 4 to 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, the only major difference being that, under the said Act, it is the District Collector and not the State Government who must be satisfied that the land is required to be acquired. It does not appear to us that this is a provision whi ch is unreasonable or arbitrary.\r\n\r\n9.By reason of Section 5, the land in respect of which notice under Section 4(1) is published vests absolutely in the State\r\n This appeal by special leave is filed by the State of Tamil Nadu against the judgment and order of the High Court of Madras dated 9-9-1981, where by the Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for Harijan Welfare Schemes Act, 1978, was struck down as being ultra vires the Constitution of India. The High Court came to the conclusion that the said Act did not enjoy the protection of Articles 31-C or 31-A and that it was violative of Articles 14, 19 and 300-A of the Constitution. These civil appeals each party shall bear and pay its own costs.\r\n ','D.B. Madan Vs Commissioner Of Income-Tax JUDGMENT\r\n\r\n1. Heard learned counsel on both sides.

The High Court declined to call upon the Appellate Tribunal to state a case and refer a question of law said to arise out of the Tribunal&#39;s appellate order for its opinion. The circumstance that, in doing so, the High Court relied on a decision which in turn followed an earlier one in CIT v. T.S. Hajee Moosa and Co. (Mad) implied that a question of law did arise, but the question, in view of the earlier decision, was held as not a referable question of law. It is always open to the High Court to follow its earlier decision and answer the question of law one way or the other according as whether the view taken in the earlier case commends itself to it or whether, in its opinion, that earlier view needs reconsideration. But it cannot always be said that, in all cases where a similar question of law had been answered in an earlier case in a\r\n High Court declined to call upon the Appellate Tribunal to state a case and refer a question of law said to arise out of the Tribunal&#39;s appellate order for its opinion.

Hindustan Co-operative Insurance Society Ltd., 58 I.A. 259, Ramswarup v. Munshi &amp; Ors. [1963] 3 SCR 858; Bolani Ores Ltd. v. State of Orissa, [1975] 2 SCR 138; referred to.\r\n\r\n(c) Section 55 is an instance of legislation by incorporation and not legislation by reference. In enacting s. 55 the legislature did not want to confer an unlimited right of appeal but wanted to restrict it. It found that the grounds set out in the then existing s. 100 CPC were appropriate for restricting the right of appeal and hence incorporated them in s.55. The legislature could never have intended to limit the right of appeal to any ground or grounds which might from time to time find place in s. 100 without knowing what those grounds were. [1063 B-D]\r\n\r\n(d) Secondly, the Act is a self-contained code and it is not possible to believe that the legislature could have made the right of appeal under such a code dependent on the viscititudes of a section in another statute. [1063 F]\r\n\r\n(e) That apart, an indissoluble link between s. 55 and s. 100, CPC would lead to a startling result. If, for example, s. 100 were repealed, s. 55 would be reduced to futility and the right of appeal under the Act would be wholly gone. It would be absurd to place on the language of s. 55 an interpretation which might in a given situation result in denial of the right of appeal altogether and thus defeat the plain object and purpose of the section. [1063 H]\r\n\r\n(f) Even assuming that the right of appeal under s.55 is restricted to the ground specified in the new s. 100 CPC the present appeal would still be maintainable because it involves a substantial question of law relating to the interpretation of s. 13(2) of the Act. [1064 D]\r\n\r\n(g) The test for determining whether a question of law raised in an appeal is a substantial question of law is to see whether it is of general public importance or whether it directly or substantially affects the rights of parties and if so whether it is an open question in the sense that it is not finally settled by this Court or by the Privy Council or by the Federal Court or is not free from difficulty or call for discussion of alternative views. [1064 E] Sir Chunilal V. Mehta &amp; Sons Ltd. v. The Century Spinning and Manufacturing Co. Ltd., [1962] Supp. 3 SCR 549; referred to.\r\n\r\nIn the present case the appeal clearly involves a substantial question of law within the meaning of the Act, because the interpretation of s. 13(2) directly and substantially affects the rights of the parties and is not finally settled by this Court.\r\n\r\n2(a) The words &quot;in the manner in which it was made-&#39; occurring in s. 13(2) have no bearing on the content or the scope and ambit of the power but merely indicate the procedure to be followed by the Commission in amending or revoking an order made by it. [1064 H]\r\n\r\n(b) The power conferred under s. 13(2) is of the widest amplitude and in this respect it is unlike s. 22 of the English Act. This power is intended to ensure that the order passed is and continues to be in conformity with the requirements of the Act, and the trade practice condemned by the order is really and truly a restrictive trade practices and it must therefore, be construed in a wide sense so as to effectuate the object and purpose of the grant of the power. [1065 B]\r\n\r\n(c) The powers under s. 13(2) and s. 55 are distinct and independent powers and one cannot be read as subject to the other. The scope and applicability of s. 13(2) is not cut down by the provision for appeal under s. 55. It is perhaps because the right of appeal given under s. 55 is limited to a question of law that a wide and unfettered power is conferred on the Commission to amend or revoke an order in appropriate cases. [1066 A]\r\n\r\n(d) The conferment of such wide and unusual power under s. 13(2) was necessary to ensure that an erroneous order is capable of being corrected. An order made under s. 37 or under any other provision of the Act may affect not only the parties before the Commission but also others such as the whole net-work of distributors or dealers who were not before the Commission. It may also affect the entire trade in the product. There may be some Facts or circumstances having a crucial bearing on the determination of the enquiry which, if taken into account, may result in a different order being made or some fact or circumstance may arise which may expose the invalidity of the order or render it bad. There may be a material change in the relevant circumstances subsequent to the making of the order. Therefore, by its very nature. the order of the Commission is transient or pro-tempore and must be liable to be altered or revoked according as there is material change in the relevant economic facts and circumstance. [1366 B-E]\r\n\r\n(e) But howsoever large may be the power under s. 13(2), it cannot be construed to be so wide as to permit a rehearing on the same material without anything more with a view to showing that the order was wrong on facts. [1067]\r\n\r\n(f) When Regulation 85 says that the provisions of s. 114 and O. XLVII, r. 1 CPC shall as far as may, be applied to the proceedings under s. 13(2) it cannot be read to mean that an application under s. 13(2) can be maintained only on the grounds set out in s. 114 and O. XLVII r. 1. This regulation does not in any manner limit the width and amplitude of the power under s. 13(2). A good part of it is procedural in nature and has nothing to do with the grounds on which an application under s. 13(2) may be maintained. The words &quot;as far as may&quot; occurring in its last part do not indicate that an application under s. 13(2) can be maintained only on the grounds set out in s. 114 and O. XLVII, r. 1, CPC. All that they indicate is that the provisions of s. 114 and O. XLVII, r. 1 are to be invoked only to the extent applicable, and if in a given case they are not applicable they may be ignored; but that does not mean that the power conferred under s. 13 (2) would not be exercisable in such a case. The reference to the provisions of s. 114 and O. XLVII, r. 1 does not limit the grounds on which an application may be made under s. 13(2). Clearly, therefore, even if a case does not fall within s. 114 and O. XLVII, r. 1, the Commission would have power in an appropriate case to amend or revoke an order made by it in the exercise of its power under s. 13(2). [1067 E-H] 3(a) The power of the Commission under s. 13(2) was exercisable in the present case and the order dated 14th May 1976 was liable to be revoked. [1077 B]\r\n\r\n(b) The submission of the distributorship agreement for registration under s. 33 cannot be construed as admission on the appellant&#39;s part that the clauses in the agreement constituted restrictive trade practices. The appellant had possibly submitted the agreement for registration on the erroneous view (which was also the view of the Commission in the Telco case) that the moment an agreement contains a trade practice falling within any of the clauses of s. 33(1) the trade practice must, irrespective of whether it falls within the definition of s. 2(o) or not, be regarded as a restrictive trade practice and the agreement must be registered. The question whether a particular trade practice is restrictive or not is essentially a question of law based on the application of the definition in s. 2(o) to the facts of a given case and no admission on a question of law can ever be used, in evidence against the make of the admission. Therefore, even assuming that there was an admission in submitting the agreement for registration it could not be used as evidence against the appellant in the enquiry under s. 37. [1075 C-G]\r\n\r\n(c) There was nothing in the conduct of the appellant which would amount to acquiescence or raise an estoppel against it. The appellant did not at any time, accept the impugned order knowing that it was erroneous. There can be no acquiescence without knowledge of the right to repudiate or challenge. [1068 H]\r\n\r\n(d) Neither did the failure of the appellant to prefer an appeal amount to acquiescence on its part because an application under s. 13(2), which is An alternative and a more effective remedy, was available to it. [1069 G]\r\n\r\n(e) The fact that the appellant did not implement the impugned order by entering into revised distributorship agreements with its distributors also showed that there was no acquiescence on its part so far as the order dated 14th May 1976 was concerned. [1070 C]\r\n\r\n(f) Estoppel can arise only if a party to a proceeding had altered his position on the faith of a representation or promise made by another. In the instant case there is nothing to show that the Registrar had altered his position on the basis of the application for extension of time made by the appellant. [1107 D] 4(a). The order of the Commission was bad because it was based on no material and, could not possibly have been made by the Commission. [1076 A-B]\r\n\r\n(b) The definition of restrictive trade practice in the Act is, to some extent, based on the rule of reason evolved by American courts while interpreting a similar provision in the Sherman Act. The rule of reason normally requires ascertainment of facts or features peculiar to the particular business, its condition before and after the restraint was imposed, the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable, the history of the restraint and the evil believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular restraint and the purpose sought to be attained. It is only on a consideration of these factors that it can be decided whether a particular act, contract or agreement imposing the restraint is unduly restrictive of competition so as to constitute restraint of trade. Certain restraint of trade are unreasonable per se because of their pernicious effect on competition and lack of any redeeming virtue; they are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and, therefore, illegal without elaborate enquiry as to the precise harm they have caused or the business execuse for their use. In such cases illegality does not depend on a showing of the unreasonableness of the practice and it is unnecessary to have a trial to show the nature, extent and degree of its market effect. [1074 A, B; 1075 A-B]\r\n\r\n(c) It is now settled law that every trade practice which is in restraint of trade is not necessarily restrictive trade practice. If a trade practice merely regulates and thereby promotes competition it would not fall within the definition even if it is to some extent in restraint of trade. Therefore, the question whether a trade practice is a restrictive trade practice or not has the decided not on any theoretical or a priori reasoning. but by inquirie whether it has or may have the effect of preventing distorting or restricting competition. The peculiar facts and features of the trade would be very much relevant in determining this question. [1072 H]\r\n\r\n(d) In the Telco case this Court laid down that an application by the Registrar under s. 10(a) (iii) must contain facts which in his opinion constitute restrictive trade practice and show or establish as to how the alleged clauses constitute restrictive trade practice in the context of the facts. But even if the application does not set out any facts or features showing how the trade practices complained of by the Registrar are restrictive practices, the Registrar can still, at the hearing of the enquiry, in the absence of any demand for particulars being made by the opposite party produce material before the Commission disclosing facts or features which go to establish the restrictive nature of the trade practice complained of and if that is done, the defect in the application would not be of much consequence. [1070 G-H] In the instant case the burden of producing the necessary material that the impugned trade practices had the actual or probable effect of diminishing or destroying competition and were therefore restrictive trade practices was on the Registrar who made on application before the Commission. No material beyond reproducing the impugned clauses of the agreement and the words of the relevant sections having been produced, the application of the Registrar was contrary to the law laid down by this Court. Therefore, the Commission had no basis for making its order dated 14th May 1976.\r\n\r\n(e) The argument that the trade practices referred to in the offending clauses were per se restrictive trade practices and in any event, even if any supporting material was necessary, it was to be found in the admission of the appellant contained in its letter submitting the distributorship agreement for registration was without any force.\r\n\r\n5(a). When the issue before the court is whether a practice trade practice set out in an agreement has or may have the effect of preventing, distorting or restricting competition so as to constitute a restrictive trade practice, it is the actual or probable effect of the trade practice which has to be judged and there is no question of contradicting, varying, adding to or substracting from the terms of the agreement by admitting extraneous evidence. The various factors stated earlier are required to be taken into account only for the purpose of determining the actual or probable effect of the trade practice referred to in the particular clause. In such a case it is not right to shut out oral evidence to determine the actual or probable effect of the trade practice. [1078 D-E]\r\n\r\n(b) It is not s. 33(1) which invalidates a clause in an agreement relating to a trade practice but it is the restrictive nature of the trade practice as set out in s. 2(o) which makes it void. [1079 E]\r\n\r\n(c) When a question of restrictive trade practice arises in relation to a clause in an agreement it is the trade practice in the clause that has to be examined for determining its actual or probable effect on competition. A clause in an agreement may proprio vigore impose a restraint. Where such restraint produces or is reasonably likely to produce the prohibited statutory effect it would clearly constitute a restrictive trade practice and the clause would be bad. [1108 D-E] Tata Engineering &amp; Locomotive Co. Ltd., Bombay,, v. The Registrar of the Restrictive Trade Agreement New Delhi, [1977] 2 SCR 685, applied.\r\n\r\nObservations in Hindustan Lever Ltd. v. M.R.T.P. [1977] 3 SCR 455; disapproved.\r\n\r\n(d) In a case where a clause in agreement does not by- itself impose any restraint but empowers the manufacturer or supplier to take some action which may be restrictive of competition, the mere possibility of action being taken, which may be restrictive of competition, would not in all cases affect the legality of the clause. What is required to be considered for determining the legality of the clause is whether there is a real probability that the presence of the clause itself would be likely to restrict competition. This is basically a question of market effect and cannot be determined by adopting a doctrainaire approach. Each case would have to be examined on its own facts from a business and commonsense point of view. It cannot, therefore, be said that in every case where the clause is theoretically capable of being so utilised as to unjustifiably restrict competition it would constitute a restrictive trade practice. [1081 E-H] 6(a). The order dated 14th May 1976 was clearly vitiated by an error of law apparent on the face of the record inasmuch as it contained only the final and operative order without giving any reasons in support of it. [1083 E]\r\n\r\n(b) The two conditions precedent before the Commission can pass a cease and desist order are (i) it must be found that the trade practice complained of is a restrictive trade practice and (ii) where such a finding is reached the Commission must be satisfied that none of the &quot;gateways&quot; pleaded in answer to the complaint exists. [1082 D-E]\r\n\r\n(c) In the instant case the appellant did not appear before the Commission and no &#39;gateways&quot; were pleaded and therefore the question of the Commission arriving at a satisfaction in regard to &quot;gateways&quot; did not arise. Nonetheless the Commission was required to be satisfied that the trade practices complained of were restrictive trade practices. The order dated 14th May 1976 did not contain any discussion showing that the Commission had reached the requisite satisfaction. It gave merely bald directions without any reasons. The ex-parte character of the order did not absolve the Commission from the obligation to give reasons in support of the order because the appellant would have been entitled to prefer an appeal even against on ex-parte order and in the absence of reasons, the appellant would not be in a position to attack the order in appeal. It is well established that every quasi-judicial order must be supported by reasons. [1082 E-H] N.M. Desai v. Textiles Ltd., C.A. 245 of 1970, dec. On 17th Dec., 1975; Simons Engineering Co. v.

Datar and Girish Chandra for Respondent No. 2.\r\n\r\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATI, J.-This appeal under section 55 of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) raises interesting questions of law relating to the interpretation and application of certain provisions of the Act. The facts giving rise to the appeal are for the most part undisputed and they may be briefly stated as follows:\r\n\r\nThe appellant is a public limited company engaged in manufacture and sale of jeep motor vehicles and their Spare parts and accessories. Since 1947 the appellant was marketing and distri-\r\n\r\nbuting jeep motor vehicles and it had set up a large and complex net work of dealers, who were described as distributors, for marketing and after sale service of such vehicles. In or about 1956 the appellant started manufacturing its own jeep motor vehicles and since then it has been manufacturing such vehicles and distributing and marketing the same through its net work of distributors. The appellant has appointed these distributors for marketing and sale of jeep motor vehicles on certain terms and conditions contained in a standard distributorship agreement. The material clauses of this agreement read as follows:\r\n\r\n&quot;Section (3): TERRITORY OF DISTRIBUTOR:-` The Company grants to Distributor the non-exclusive privilege (except as hereinafter provided) of selling at re tail and the right (except hereinafter provided) to appoint in writing by forms of agreements approved by the Company, Dealers to sell at retail the products enumerated in Section 2 of this agreement, within the following territory and also demarcated in the map attached hereto and which forms a part of this agreement.\r\n\r\nDistributor accepts the above retail setting privileges and agrees to develop with diligence the sales of sale products in said territory in accordance with this agreement and undertakes to achieve the quantum of sales in the territory as may be fixed by the Company from time to time.\r\n\r\nSection (4): LIMITATIONS ON TERRITORIAL RIGHTS:-\r\n\r\n(i) Distributor agrees not to solicit outside of the territory described in Section 3-the purchase of any products.\r\n\r\n* * * * Section (6): PRICE AND PAYMENT :-Distributor will pay for products the Company&#39;s established Distributor net prices in effect on date on despatch. Price lists will be furnished to Distributor by the Company, but the Company reserves the right to change prices at any time without notice.\r\n\r\n* * * * Section (11): PRICE CHANGES :-If the Company reduces its published suggested retail list price, for any current model of &#39;Jeep&#39; motor vehicles, the company will make an allowance to Distributor as hereinafter provided. The allowance shall be made in respect of new and unused &#39;Jeep&#39; Motor Vehicles of the then current model in respect of which the price change has been made which `have been purchased by Distributor from the Company within a period of 30 (thirty) days prior to the effective date of such decrease in suggested list price, and which distributor shall have in his unsold stock on such effective date. The allowance shall be equal to the difference between the net amount paid to the Company for such &#39;Jeep&#39; Motor Vehicle (less all allowance thereto granted), and the net amount which would have been paid had such &#39;Jeep&#39; motor vehicles been purchased at the reduced price. No allowance, how ever, shall be made unless there is a reduction in the RETAIL list price and increases in discounts, bonuses and the like shall in no event be considered as a reduction in price.\r\n\r\n* * * * Section (17): CARE OF OWNER AND CUSTOMER RELATIONS :- Distributor agrees-\r\n\r\n* * * *\r\n\r\n(a) To refrain from selling or offering for sale any competing product. The Company shall be the sole judge as to whether a product is competing or not&quot;\r\n\r\nThe appellant by its letter dated 27th January, 1971 submitted to the Registrar of Restrictive Trade Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the Registrar) certified copies of agreements entered into by the appellant with the Distributors for registration, since in the opinion of the appellant, they were registrable under the provisions of Ch. V of the Act. The appellant also submitted to the Registrar along with its letter dated 19th May, 1972 four copies of the standard distributorship agreement for registration in terms of cl. (ii) of Rule 12 of the Monopolies Restrictive Trade Practices Rules, 1970 (hereinafter referred to as the Rules) and the standard distributorship agreement was registered by the Registrar under section 35 of the Act.\r\n\r\nOn 17th December, 1975 the Registrar made an application to 11 the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission (hereinafter referred to as the Commission) under section 10(a) (iii) of the Act pointing out to the Commission that the standard distributorship agreement entered into by the appellant with the distributors was filed by the appellant for registration in the office of the Registrar and the same had been duly registered under section 35 of the Act. The Registrar drew the attention of the Commission to clauses (3), (4), (5), (6), (11), (13), (14), (17) and (20) of the standard distributorship agreement and claimed that the provisions contained in these clauses related &quot;to restrictive trade practices relating to imposing restrictions on persons and classes of persons to whom goods are sold and from whom goods are bought tie-up sales/full-line forcing; exclusive dealing; granting or allowing concessions; discounts, over- riding commission, etc. in connection with or by reason of dealings; resale price maintenance; and allocation of area/market for disposal of products covered under the agreement, respectively attracting clauses (a), (b), (c),\r\n\r\n(e), (f) and (g) of section 33(1) and/or section 2(o) of the Act&quot; and that these restrictive trade practices had and might have the effect of preventing, distorting and restricting competition and tended to bring about monopolisation of prices and conditions of delivery and to affect the flow of supplies in the market relating to goods covered under the standard distributorship agreement in such manner as to impose on the consumers unjustified costs and restrictions and the same were prejudicial to public interest. The Registrar prayed on the basis of these allegations that the Commission be pleased to inquire into the restrictive trade practices indulged in by the appellant, under section 37 of the Act and pass such orders as it might deem fit and proper. The Commission, on receipt of this application, decided, in exercise of the powers conferred upon it under sections 10(a) and 37 of the Act, to hold inquiry into the restrictive trade practices complained of by the Registrar and issued notice dated 2nd January, 1976 under Regulation 53 of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission Regulations, 1974 (hereinafter referred to as the Regulations) to the appellant that if the appellant wished to be heard in the proceedings before the Commission, it should comply with the requirements of Regulations 65 and 67 failing which the Commission would proceed with the inquiry in the absence of respondent. The appellant, by its letter dated 3rd February, 1976, acknowledged receipt of the notice and intimated to the Commission that it did not wish to be heard in the proceedings before the Commission but put forward its submissions in regard to the restrictive trade practices alleged by the Registrar in his application. The appellant pointed out that the clauses of the standard distributionship agreement complained of by the Registrar did not constitute restrictive trade practices for the reasons explained in the letter and requested the Deputy Secretary to place their submissions before the Commission at the enquiry to be held by it. The letter was purported to be submitted in terms of Regulations 36(3), but the reference to this Regulation was obviously under some misapprehension because this Regulation occurred in Chapter V which provided the procedure for reference under Chapter III and IV and it had no application in case of an inquiry under section 37 of the Act. The Joint Secretary (Legal) of the Commission pointed out to the appellant by his letter dated 11th February, 1976 that if the appellant wished to be heard in the proceedings, the appellant should comply with the requirements of Regulations 65 and 67 and it is only if the appellant did so, that it could file a reply in answer to the application of the Registrar and moreover, the reply had to be properly drawn and duly verified and declared as provided in those Regulations. The Joint Secretary. (Legal) made it clear that in view of this legal position obtaining under Regulations 65 and 67, it was not possible to take note of contents of the letter addressed by the appellant setting out the explanation for the various clauses impugned in the application of the Registrar. Though this position, in law was specifically pointed out by the Joint Secretary (Legal) on behalf of the Commission, the appellant did not comply with the procedure set out in Regulations 65 and 67 with the result that the Commission decided to proceed exparte against the appellant. The Registrar filed an affidavit of the Assistant Registrar dated 10th May, 1976 in support of the allegations contained in the application but this affidavit surprisingly did not contain any further or other material than that set out in the application. No other evidence, oral or documentary, was produced by the Registrar and the Commission proceeded to decide the issues arising in the enquiry on the basis of the application supported by the affidavit of the Assistant Registrar. The Commission, after going through the application and the affidavit of the Assistant Registrar and hearing the Registrar, made an order dated 14th May, 1976, the operative part of which was in the following terms:\r\n\r\n&quot;(1) The Respondent is hereby restrained and prohibited by any agreement with any distributor to restrict by any method the persons or classes or persons to whom the goods are sold whether such person be retail purchaser or a dealer.\r\n\r\n(2) The Respondent is hereby restrained and prohibited from restricting in any manner, any purchaser whether a dealer or otherwise in the course of its trade from acquir-\r\n\r\ning or otherwise dealing in any goods other than those of the Respondent or the goods of any other person. (3) The Respondent is hereby restrained and prohibited from selling any goods to any distributor, dealer or other wise on the condition that the prices to be charged on resale by the purchaser shall be the prices stipulated by the respondent unless it is clearly stated that prices lower than those prices may be charged. The Respondent is hereby directed that in all future price lists it must state on the cover or on the front page that the prices if any indicated therein as resale prices are maximum prices and that the prices lower than those price may be charged.\r\n\r\n(4) The Respondent is hereby restrained and prohibited from allocating any area or market to any distributor or dealer for the disposal of the Respondent&#39;s goods. (5) The Respondent is hereby restrained and prohibited from preventing any distributor from appointing any dealer of its own choice on such terms and conditions as may be mutually agreed upon between distributors and dealers in cases where the Respondent does not undertake any obligation, liability or responsibility in respect of the dealers.\r\n\r\n(6) The clauses in the agreements relating to the above restrictive trade practices are hereby declared to be void. The practices arising therefore, shall be discontinued and shall not be repeated. (7) The Respondent shall within 3 months from the date of service of this order on it make and file an affidavit before the Commission setting out the manner in which this order has been given effect to. A copy of the said affidavit shall simultaneously be furnished to the Registrar.\r\n\r\n(8) There will be no order as to costs.&quot;\r\n\r\nSince the appellant was required to file an affidavit of compliance within three months as directed by cl. (7) of the Order, the appellant filed an affidavit dated 10th September, 1976 stating that the appellant had fully implemented in practice the directions contained in Paragraphs (1) and (5) of the Order and refrained from enforcing against the distributors any of the clauses which had been declared void by the Commission. The appellant also pointed out that a draft of a new distributorship agreement was being finalised by the appellant with a view to giving effect to the &quot;restrictions and prohibitions&quot; contained in the Order. The Registrar filed an affidavit of the Deputy Registrar dated 27th September, 1976 seeking particulars from the appellant showing how the appellant had implemented the directions contained in the Order. The appellant by its reply dated 11th November, 1976 pointed out that since the date of receipt of the Order, the appellant had not given effect to the trade practices covered by paragraphs (1) to (5) of the Order nor required any of the distributors to abide by the clauses of the standard distributorship agreement relating to those trade practices and on the contrary, intimated to the distributors that the old distributorship agreement would have to be substituted by a new revised agreement. The appellant submitted that since the clauses of the standard distributorship agreement declared void by the Commission were not enforceable in law by the appellant, it did not make any difference whether or not they were deleted from the existing distributorship agreement and in view of the fact that a new revised agreement was being prepared which would comply with the directions contained in the Order, it was not necessary, to effect any amendments in the existing distributorship agreement. It seems that there was a hearing before the Commission on this issue as regards compliance with the directions contained in the Order and the draft of the revised distributorship agreement prepared by the appellant was considered and pursuant to the suggestion made by the Commission, the appellant agreed to amend two clauses in the draft and the Commission by its Order dated 7th December, 1976 directed that the revised distributorship agreement should be filed by the appellant by 31st March, 1977.\r\n\r\nNow, it appears that subsequent to the Order of the Commission dated 7th December, 1976 an important decision was given by this Court in Tata Engineering &amp; Locomotive Co. Ltd., Bombay v. The Registrar of the Restrictive Trade Agreement, New Delhi(&#39;) relating to the interpretation of some of the relevant provisions of the Act bearing on restrictive trade practices. This decision was given in all appeal preferred by Tata Engineering Locomotive Co. Ltd. (herein- after referred to as the Telco against an order made by the Commission in an enquiry under section 37 and it reversed the view taken by the Commission in several important respects. Though this decision was given on 21st January, 1977, it was not fully reported until March 1977 and on reading it, the appellant felt that the order of the Commission dated 14th May, 1976 required reconsideration, as it was contrary to the law laid down in this decision. The appellant accordingly made an application to the Commission on 31st March. 1977 where, besides asking for extension of time for filing a copy of the revised distributorship agreement on the ground that the dealers were spread out all over India and it would take considerable time for execution of the revised distributorship agreement by them, the appellant pointed out that it had not contested the enquiry proceedings under section 37 in the first instance because the decision given by the Commission in the Telco case was directly applicable, but since that decision of the Commission was reversed by this Court in appeal, the appellant was advised to move a suitable application for amendment and/or modification of the Order dated 14th May, 1976 and that was also an additional reason why the time for filing the revised distributorship agreement should be extended, so that the revised distributorship agreement could be in accordance with the directions, if any. which might be given by the Commission on the proposed application. The Commission acceded to the request contained in this application and extended the time for filing the revised distributorship agreement upto 4th June, 1977.\r\n\r\nThe appellant thereafter made an application dated 30th May, 1977 under section 13(2) of the Act read with Regulation 85 for revocation, amendment or modification of the Order of the Commission dated 14th May, 1976. The appellant set out in this application various facts and features relating to its trade of manufacture and sale of Jeep motor vehicles and their spare parts and accessories and enumerated a number of grounds on which the order of the Commission dated 14th May, 1976 deserved to be revised, revoked, amended or otherwise modified. The application was opposed by the Registrar by filing a reply dated. 17th August, 1977. The parties were thereafter heard by the Commission on 26th August, 1977 and pursuant to the directions given by the Commission. affidavits of documents were filed and evidence was recorded on both sides. It appears that in the course of the evidence the appellant came to know that in November 1977 Hindustan Motors Ltd. had introduced in the 6 market diesel trekker which was clearly a competing vehicle and the appellant thereupon applied to the Commission on 30th January. 1978 for amendment of the application by adding a plea that the fact that since November 1977 Hindustan Motor Ltd. had started manufacturing and selling diesel trekker which was a highly competitive product was another material change in the relevant circumstances which justified the revocation, amendment or modification of the Order dated 14th May, 1976. This application for amendment was opposed by the Registrar on the ground that it was made at a very late stage of the proceeding. The Commission did not pass any order on this application for amendment and kept it pending and proceeded to dispose of the main application by an Order dated 28th February, 1978 by which it rejected the main application with costs and added a short order On the same day stating that in view of the order on the main application, there would be no order on the application for amendment. The appellant thereupon preferred the present appeal in this Court under section 55 challenging the validity of the order made by the Commission rejecting the application of the appellant.\r\n\r\nBefore we set out the rival contentions of the parties in the appeal, it would be convenient at this state to refer to the relevant provisions of the Act and the Regulations. Section 2 is the definition section and clause (u) of this section defines &#39;trade practice&#39; to mean &quot;any practice relating to the carrying on of any trade, and includes-(i) anything done by any person which controls or affects the price charged by, or the method of trading of, any trader or any class of traders (ii) a single or isolated action of any person in relation to any trade&quot;. &#39;Restrictive trade practice&#39; is defiled in section 2, clause (o) to mean &quot;a grade practice which has, or may have, the effect of preventing distorting or restricting, competition in any manner and in particular,-(i) which tends to obstruct the flow of capital or resources into the stream of production, or (ii) which tends to bring about manipulation of prices, or conditions of delivery or to affect the flow of supplies in. the market relating to goods or services in such manner as to impose on the consumers unjustified costs or restrictions.&quot; Section 5, subsection (1) provides for the establishment of the Commission which is to consist of a Chairman and not less than two and not more than eight other members to be appointed by the Central Government and sub- section (2) of section 5 lays down that the Chairman shall be a person who is or has been or is qualified to be a judge of the Supreme Court or of a High Court. It is obvious from these two sub-sections of section 5 that the Legislature clearly contemplated that the Commission must have a Chairman who would provide the judicial element and there must be at least two other members who would provide expertise in subjects like economics, law, commerce. accountancy, industry, public affairs or administration. so that there could be a really high-powered expert commission competent and adequate to deal with the various problems which come before it. It, however, appears that the Central Government paid scant regard to this` legislative requirement and though the office of Chairman fell vacant as far back as 9th August, 1976, it failed to make appointment of Chairman until 24th February, 1978. Of the two other members of the Commission one had already resigned earlier and his vacancy was also not filled with the result that the Commission continued with only one member for a period of about 18 months. This was a most unfortunate state of affairs, for it betrayed total lack of concern for the proper constitution and functioning of the Commission and complete neglect of its statutory obligation by the Central Government. We fail to see any reason why the Central Government could not make the necessary appointments and properly constitute the Commission in accordance with the requirements of the Act. It is difficult to believe that legal and judicial talent in the country had become so impoverished that the Central Government could not find a suitable person to fill the vacancy of Chairman for a year and a half. Moreover it must be remembered that the appointments, after all, have to be made from whatever legal and judicial talent is available and the situation is not going to improve by waiting for a year or two: a new star is not going to appear in the legal firmament within such a short time and the appointments cannot be held up indefinitely. Indeed, it is highly undesirable that important quasi-judicial or administrative posts should remain vacant for long periods of time, because apart from impairing the efficiency of the functioning of the statutory authority of the administration. inexplicable delay may shake the confidence of the public in the integrity of the appointments when made. Turning back to the provisions of the Act, we find that section 10(a) (iii) empowers the Commission to inquire into any restrictive trade practice upon an application made to it by the Registrar. The powers of the Commission while holding an enquiry under the Act are enumerated in section 12 and section 13, sub-section (2) provides that &quot;any order made by the Commission may be amended or revoked at any time in the manner in which it was made&quot;. Then follow sections 14 to 19 which deal inter alia with the procedure to be followed by the Commission. We are not concerned with Sections 20 to 32 which occur in Chapters III and IV because they deal with topics other than restrictive trade practices. Chapter V relates to registration of agreements relating to restrictive trade practices and it consists of sections 33 to 36 of which only sections 33 and 35 are material. Sub- section (1) of section 33 provides that any agreement relating to a restrictive trade practice falling within one or more of the categories specified there shall be subject to registration in accordance with the provisions of Ch. V and proceeds to enumerate the categories of restrictive trade practices covered by that provision and section 35 lays down the time within which an agreement falling within section 33, sub-section (1) shall be registered and the procedure to be followed for effectuating such registration. Sections 37 and 38 are the next important sections and they occur in Ch. V headed A &quot;control of certain restrictive trade practices&quot;. Sub-section (1) of section 37 provides that &quot;the Commission may inquire into any restrictive trade practice, whether the agreement, if any, relating thereto has been registered under section 35 or not, which may come before it for inquiry and, if after such inquiry it is of opinion that the practice is prejudicial to the public interest, the Commission may, by order, direct that-(a) the practice shall be discontinued or shall not be repeated, (b) the agreement relating there to shall be void in respect of such restrictive trade practice or shall stand modified in respect thereof in such manner as may be specified in the order&quot;. Section 38, sub-section (1) enacts that for the purposes of any proceedings before the Commission under section 37, a restrictive trade practice shall be deemed to be prejudicial to the public interest unless the Commission is satisfied of any one or more of the circumstances set out in that subsection and is further satisfied, after balancing the competing considerations, that the restriction is not unreasonable. These circumstances specified in sub-section (1) of section 38 render a trade practice permissible even though it is restrictive and provide what have been picturesquely described in the English law as &quot;gateways&quot; out of the prohibition of restrictive trade practices. Section 55 is the next relevant section and it provides that any person aggrieved by any order made by the Central Government under Ch. III or Ch. IV or as the case may be, of the Commission under section 13 or section 37 may, within 60 days from the date of the order, prefer an appeal to the Supreme Court on &quot;one or more of the grounds specified in section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908&quot;. This is the section under which the present appeal has been preferred by the appellant. The last section to which we must refer is section 66 which confers power on the Commission to make Regulations for the efficient performance of its functions under the Act. The Commission has, in exercise of the power conferred by this section, made the Regulations of which three arc material. namely, Regulations 65, 67 and 85. These Regulations, in so far as material, read as follows &quot;Section 65: APPEARANCE OF PARTIES : Every respondent who wishes to be heard in the proceedings shall within 14 days of the service upon him of the copy of the notice of enquiry, enter an appearance in the office of the Commission by delivering to the Secretary six copies of a memorandum stating that the respondent wishes to be heard in the proceedings and containing the name of his advocate having an office in Delhi or New Delhi and duly authorised to accept service of processes and the Secretary shall send one copy of the memorandum to the Registrar in case where proceedings are initiated under sub- clause (iii) of clause (a) of section 10, and in all other cases to the Director of Investigation.&quot; &quot;Section 67: REPLY TO THE NOTICE: Every respondent who has entered an appearance shall within four weeks of his entering appearance deliver to the Secretary a reply to the notice (5 copies) which shall include:-\r\n\r\n(a) particulars of each of the provisions of section 38 of Act on which he intends to rely; and\r\n\r\n(b) particulars of the facts and matters alleged by him to entitle him to rely on such provisions.&quot; &quot;Section 85: AMENDMENT OR REVOCATION OF ORDER ETC.: An application under sub-section (2) of section 13 of the Act for amendment-or revocation of any order made by the Commission in any proceedings shall be supported by evidence on affidavit of the material change in the relevant circumstances or any other fact or circumstances on which the applicant relies. Unless the Commission otherwise directs notice of the application together with copies of the affidavits in support thereof, shall be served on every party who appeared at the hearing of the previous proceedings and every such party shall be entitled to be heard on the application and the provisions of section 114 and Order XLVII of the Code of Civil Procedure, &#39;908 (5 of 1908), shall as far as may, be applied to these proceedings.&quot; It is against the background of these provisions of the Act and the Regulations that we have to determine the question arising for consideration in the appeal.\r\n\r\nThe contention of the appellant in support of the appeal was that the Order dated 14th May, 1976 suffered from various infirmities and was liable to be revoked or in any event modified under section 13(2) of the Act. It was said that the application of the Registrar on which the Order dated 14th May, 1976 was made did not set out any facts or features showing how the trade practices referred to in the application were restrictive of competition so as to constitute restrictive trade practices and merely contained a bald recital of the impugned clause and mechanical reproduction of the language of the relevant sections without anything more. The application of the Registrar was thus not in accordance with the law laid down in the decision of this Court in the Telco case and no order could be made upon it by the Commission. It was also urged that there was no material placed before the Commission by the Registrar on the basis of which the Commission could possibly come to the conclusion that the trade practices referred to in the application were restrictive trade practices. Even if the Commission was justified in proceeding exparte against the appellant, the highest that could be assumed in favour of the Registrar was that the facts set out in the application and the supporting affidavit of the Assistant Registrar would be deemed to be admitted, but, apart from the impugned clauses, no other facts were set out either in the application or in the affidavit of the Assistant Registrar and there was accordingly no evidence on which the order dated 14th May, 1976 could be made by the Commission. It was also contended that the Order dated 14th May, 1976 did not set out any facts peculiar to the trade of the appellant or the conditions before and after the imposition of the restraint or the actual or probable effect of the restraint nor did it indicate as to how the trade practices referred to in the impugned clauses constituted restrictive trade practices; it was a non-speaking order which did not give any reasons at all for holding that the trade practices complained of were restrictive trade practices and hence it was vitiated by a legal infirmity. The appellant further urged that the Order dated 14th May, 1976 was a continuing order as it required the appellant not merely to cease but also to desist from the restrictive trade practices set out in the order and it was, therefore, required to be continually justifiable and since the facts and features of the trade set out in the application of the appellant clearly established that the trade practices referred to in the impugned clauses did not constitute restrictive trade practices, the Order dated 14th May, 1976 was not justified and in any event could not be continued and it was accordingly liable to be revoked or amended under section 13(2). It was submitted that in any event the Order dated 14th May, l 976 was contrary to the law declared by this Court in the Telco case and since the decision in the Telco case was a fact or circumstance subsequent to the making of the Order, it justified the invocation of the power under section 13(2) for revoking or modifying the Order. Lastly, it was contended that in any view of the matter there was a material change in the relevant circumstances subsequent to the making of the Order dated 14th May, 1976 in that Hindustan Motor Ltd. started manufacturing and marketing competing utility vehicles since June 1976 and this was sufficient to warrant reconsideration of the Order under section 13 (2) . The respondents raised a preliminary objection against the maintainability of the appeal on the ground that under section 55 read with the newly substituted section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, an appeal could lie to this Court only on a substantial question of law and since the contentions raised on behalf of the appellant did not raise any substantial question of law, the appeal was not maintainable. The respondents also urged that on a proper construction of section 13(2) read with Regulation 85, the Commission could revoke or amend the Order dated 14th May, 1976 only if there was a material change in the relevant circumstances since the making of the Order or any of the grounds specified in Order XLVlI rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 was available to the appellant. The second and third grounds specified in Order XLVII, rule 1 obviously did not exist in the present case and the claim of the appellant for exercise of the power under section 13(2) could, if at all, rest only on the first ground, namely error of law apparent on the face of the record. But, said the respondents, there was no error of law apparent on the face of the record so far as the Order dated 14th May, 1976 was concerned, nor was there any material change in the relevant circumstances subsequent to the making of the order and hence section 13(2) was not attracted. The respondents contended that what the appellant was seeking to achieve by the application under section 13(2) was reconsideration of the Order dated 14th May, 1976 which was clearly impermissible, since section 13(2) could not be used as a substitute, for section 55 and that too, without the restrictive condition of that section. It was also urged on behalf of the respondents that, in any event the appellant was precluded from challenging the Order dated 14th May, 1976 by an application under Section 13(2) by reason of its subsequent conduct in acquiescing in the Order and unconditionally accepting the same. The appellant clearly waived the defects or infirmities if any in the Order dated 14th May, 1976 and was precluded from raising any contention against the validity of that Order. The respondents disputed validity of the contentions raised on behalf of the appellant and urged that in any event even if any of these defects or infirmities were present, they did not render the Order void as being without jurisdiction and hence the validity of the Order could not be challenged in the collateral proceedings under section 13(2). The respondents also contended that in any view of the matter the Order dated 14th May, 1976 was justified inasmuch as the trade practices complained of by the Registrar were restrictive trade practices. These were the rival contentions urged on behalf of the parties and we shall now proceed to examine The first question that arises for consideration in the preliminary objection of the respondents is as to what is the true scope and admit of an appeal under section 55. That section provides inter alia that any person aggrieved by an order made by the Commission under section 13 may prefer an appeal to this Court on &quot;one or more of the grounds specified in section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908&quot;. Now at the date when section 55 was enacted, namely, 27th December, 1969, being the date of coming into force of the Act, section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure specified three grounds on which a second appeal could be brought to the High Court and one of these grounds was that the decision appealed against was contrary to law. It was sufficient under section 100 as it stood then that there should be a question of law in order to attract the jurisdiction of the High Court in second appeal and, therefore, if the reference in section 55 were to the grounds set out in the then existing section 100, there can be no doubt that an appeal would lie to this Court under section 55 on a question of law. But subsequent to the enactment of section 55 section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure was substituted by a new section by section 37 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1976 with effect from 1st February, 1977 and the new section 100 provided that a second appeal shall lie to the High Court only if the High Court is satisfied that the case involves a substantial question of law. The three grounds on which a second appeal could lie under the former section 100 were abrogated and in their place only one ground was substituted which was a highly stringent ground, namely, that there should be a substantial question of law. This was the new section 100 which was in force on the date when the present appeal was preferred by the appellant and the argument of the respondents was that the maintainability of the appeal was, therefore, required to be judged by reference to the ground specified in the new section 100 and the appeal could be entertained only if there was a substantial question of law. The respondents leaned heavily on section 8(1) of the General Clauses Act, 1897 which provides:\r\n\r\n&quot;8(1) Where this Act, or any Central Act or Regulation made after the commencement of this Act, repeals and re-enacts, with or without modification, any provision of a former enactment, then references in any other enactment or in any instrument to the provision so repealed shall, un-\r\n\r\nless a different intention appears, be construed as references to the provision so re-enacted.&quot;\r\n\r\nand contended that the substitution of the new section 100 amounted to repeal and re-enactment of the former section 100 and, therefore, on an application of the rule of interpretation enacted in section 8(1), the reference in section 55 to section 100 must be construed as reference to the new section 100 and the appeal could be maintained only on the ground specified in the new section 100, that is, on a substantial question of law. We do not think this contention is well founded. It ignores the distinction between a mere reference to or citation of one statute in another and an incorporation which in effect means bodily lefting a provision of one enactment and making it a part of another. Where there is mere reference to or citation of one enactment in another without incorporation, section 8(1) applies and the repeal and re-enactment of the provision referred to or cited has the effect set out in that section and the reference to the provision repealed is required to be construed as reference to the provision as re-enacted. Such was the case in the Collector of Customs, Madras v. Nathella Sampathu Chetty &amp; Anr. and the New Central Jute Mills Co. Ltd. v. The Assistant Collector of Central Excise, Allahabad &amp; Ors. But where a provision of one statute is incorporated in another, the repeal or amendment of the former does not affect the latter. The effect of incorporation is as if the provision were written out in the incorporating statute and were a part of it. Legislation by incorporation is a common legislative device employed by the legislature, where the legislature for convenience of drafting incorporates provisions from an existing statute by reference to that statute instead of setting out for itself at length the provisions which it desires to adopt. Once the incorporation is made, the provision incorporated becomes an integral part of the statute in which it is transposed and thereafter there is no need to refer to the statute from which the incorporation is made and any subsequent amendment made in it has no effect on the incorporating statute. Lord Esher, M.R., while dealing with legislation in incorporation in In re. Wood&#39;s Estate (1886) 31 Ch.D. 607 pointed out at page 615:\r\n\r\n&quot;If a subsequent Act brings into itself by reference some of the clauses of a former Act, the legal effect of that, as has often been held, is to write those sections into the new Act.\r\n\r\njust as if they had been actually written in it with the pen, or printed in it, and, the moment you have those clauses in the later Act, you have no occasion to refer to the former Act at all.&quot;\r\n\r\nLord Justice Brett, also observed to the same effect in Clark v. Bradlaugh (1881) 8 Q.B.D. 63 at 69 :\r\n\r\n&quot; there is a rule of construction that, where a statute is incorporated by reference into a second statute, the repeal of the first statute by a third statute does no affect the second.&quot;\r\n\r\nThis was the rule applied by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Secretary of State for India in Council v. Hindustan Cooperative Insurance Society Ltd. The Judicial Committee pointed out in this case that the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 having been incorporated in the Calcutta Improvement Trust Act, 1911 and become an integral part of it, the subsequent amendment of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 by the addition of sub-section (2) in section 26 had no effect on the Calcutta Land Improvement Trust Act, 1911 and could not be read into it. Sir George Lowndes delivering the opinion of the Judicial Committee observed at page 267 :\r\n\r\n&quot;In this country it is accepted that where a statute is incorporated by reference into a second statute, the repeal of the first statute does not affect the second: see the cases collected in Craies on Statute Law, 3rd edn. pp. 349, 350.\r\n\r\n\r\n	  x		x	      x		     x\r\n	      x	   x   x    The independent existence of the\r\n\r\n\r\ntwo Acts is, therefore, recognized; despite the death of the parent Act, its offspring survives in the incorporating Act. x x x It seems to be no less logical to hold that where certain provisions from an existing Act have been incorporated into a subsequent Act, no addition to the former Act, which is not expressly made applicable to the subsequent Act, can be deemed to be incorporated in it, at all events if it is possible for the subsequent Act to function effectually without the addition.&quot;\r\n\r\nSo also in Ramswarup v. Munshi &amp; Ors., it was held by this Court that since the definition of &quot;agricultural land&#39; in the Punjab Alienation of Land Act, 1900 was bodily incorporated in the Punjab Pre-emption Act, 1913, the repeal of the former Act had no effect on the continued operation of the latter. Rajagopala Ayyangar, J., speaking for the Court observed at pages 868- 869 of the Report:\r\n\r\n&quot;Where the provisions of an Act are incorporated by reference in a later Act the repeal of the earlier Act has, in general, no effect upon the construction or effect of the Act in which its provisions have been incorporated.\r\n\r\nx x x x In the circumstances, therefore, the repeal of the Punjab Alienation of Land Act of 1900 has no effect on the continued operation of the Pre-emption Act and the expression &#39;agricultural land&#39; in the latter Act has to be read as if the definition in the Alienation of Land Act had been bodily transposed into it.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe decision of this Court in Bolani Ores Ltd. v. State of Orissa also proceeded on the same principle. There the question arose in regard to the\r\n Area 10(a) (iii) of the Monopolies and Restrictive Exchange Practices Act, 1969 empowers the Monopolies and Prohibitive Trade Practices Commission to enquire into any prohibitive exchange hones upon an application made to it by the Registrar of Restrictive Trade Agreements. Segment 13(2) gives that &quot;any request made by the Commission might be revised or repudiated whenever in the way in which it was made.&quot; Section 55 gives that any individual distressed by an arrange made by the Central Government or the Commission under s. 13 or s. 37 may incline toward an interest to the Supreme Court on one or more of the grounds determined in s. 100, Code of Common Procedure, 1908. On the date on which the Act came into drive s. 100 C.P.C. indicated three grounds on which a moment bid could mislead the High Court one of them being that the choice claimed against was opposite to law. By an correction made in 1976 s.100 was substituted by a new segment which gives that a moment bid should deceive the High Court just if the High Court is fulfilled that the case includes a considerable question of law. The appealing party, who was a producer of jeep engine vehicles, their save parts and embellishments, submitted for enrollment to the Registrar of Restrictive Trade Understandings, standard distributorship assentions went into by it with its merchants. After registering the understandings, in his application to the Commission, the Enlistment center charged that certain conditions in the assention identified with prohibitive exchange rehearses and that some of them were biased to open intrigue. The litigant, in answer to the Commission&#39;s notice, expressed that it didn&#39;t wish to be heard in the procedures prior to the Commission, bringing up while there was nothing in the decried provisions of the understanding which could be said to constitute prohibitive exchange hones the reasons whereof had as of now been clarified in its answer. 1039 The Registrar documented before the Commission a testimony in support of his application yet that too did not contain any further or extra material than what was set out in his application. No other confirmation, oral or narrative, was delivered by him before the Commission in support of the affirmation that the agreement constituted a prohibitive exchange rehearse. By its request dated May 14, 1976 the Commission pronounced certain provisions of the litigant&#39;s distributorship assention to be void. While correspondence was going on between the Enlistment center and the litigant on the accommodation of a changed distributorship understanding, this Court in Tata Engineering and Train Co. Ltd. v. Enlistment center of Restrictive Trade Rehearses, [1977] 2 SCR 685 gave its understanding on the pertinent arrangements of the Act. Immediately the appealing party made an application to the Commission calling attention to that it did not challenge the enquiry procedures under s. 37 in the first occasion in light of the fact that the Commission&#39;s choice in the Telco case was specifically pertinent; yet now that that choice had been turned around by the Supreme Court in request, its request dated May 14, 1976 required correction/change. An application under s. 13 (2) read with control 85 was in like manner made for denial, correction or modification of the Commission&#39;s request of May 14, 1976. The Commission rejected this application by a request dated 28th February 1978. In its allure under s. 55 of the Act impugning the Commission&#39;s request dated 28th February 1978 the appealing party battled that (1) the Registrar&#39;s application claiming prohibitive exchange hones did not set out any actualities demonstrating how the litigant&#39;s exchange practices were prohibitive in nature and that the Registrar&#39;s application not having been made as per the law set around this Court in Telco case the denounced arrange of the Commission was subject to be denied or adjusted under s. 13(2); (2) the request did not give any purposes behind its choice as was vitiated; and (3) the order was a proceeding with request in light of the fact that it required the appealing party not merely to stop but also cease from the prohibitive exchange rehearses set out in the arrange and was, in this way required to be persistently reasonable and since it was, in opposition to the law set down in Telco case it was at risk to be repudiated or revised; in any occasion the choice of this Court being ensuing to the making of the Commission&#39;s order, there was sufficient legitimization for repudiating or modifying the request under s. 13(2) of the Act. The respondent, then again, battled that (1) on a use of the control of understanding authorized in s. 8(1) or the General Clauses Act, reference in s. 55 to s. 100 C.P.C. must be understood as a kind of perspective to the new s. 100, C.P.C. thus understood an interest to the Supreme Court would lie just if the case included &quot;a considerable question of law&quot; and not generally and since for this situation no such question was included, the interest was not viable; (2) s. 13(2) couldn&#39;t be utilized by the litigant as a substitute for s. 55; and (3) by reason of its consequent lead in assenting in the Commission&#39;s request and genuinely tolerating it, the litigant was blocked from raising any dispute against its legitimacy in offer to this Court. Permitting the interest, ^ HELD: The appeal is viable under s. 55 of the Act. [1064 C] 1(a) On a legitimate understanding of s. 55 it must be held that the grounds speci- 1040 fied in the then existing s. 100 CPC were joined in s. 55 and the substitution of the new s. 100 did not influence or confine the grounds as joined in s. 55. In any occasion, the present interest brings up generous issues of law, and so is viable. [1064 C] (b) There is a refinement between a unimportant reference to then again reference of one statute in another and a consolidation. Where there is a minor reference to or reference of one establishment in another without consolidation, s. 8(1) of the General Clause Act applies and the annulment and re-order of the arrangement alluded to or refered to has the impact set out in that area and the reference to the arrangement canceled is required to be interpreted as reference to the arrangement as re-established. In any case, where a provision of one statute is consolidated in another, the annulment or revision of the former does not influence the last mentioned. The effect of consolidation is as though the arrangement incorporated were worked out in the incorporting statute and were a piece of it. Once the consolidation is made, the arrangement joined turns into an indispensable part of the statute in which it is transposed and thereafter there is no compelling reason to allude to the statute from which the consolidation is made and any resulting change made in it has no impact on the consolidating statute.

','Shamkant Narayan Despande Vs Maharashtra Industrial CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Special Leave petition (c) No.\n4748 of 1991.\nFrom the Judgment and Order dated 21.1.91 of the Bombay High\nCourt in W.P. No. 3481 of 1990.\nN.B. Shetye,  P.M.  Pradhan  and  A.M.	khanwilkar  for	 the\npetitioner.\nDushyant Dave, Beliram Vakil, Abrar Ali, Ajit Yogi, Gajender\nLal, Mukul Gupta and Ms. Sonia Khan for the Respondents.\nThe Judgment of the court was delivered by\n     SAWANT,  J.   The	petitioner  is	diploma-  holder  in\nEngineering  and holds the post of Executive Engineer in the\nrespondent-Corporation. Till 1974, the promotion post of the\nsuperintending Engineer	 was  available	 both  for  diploma-\nholders and degree-holders according to merit-cum-seniority.\nThis was  so according	to  the	 practice  followed  by	 the\nCorporation without  making any	 rules or regulation in that\nbehalf. In  1974, the corporation made regulation by passing\na resolution  by passing a resolution and continued the same\npractice. Admittedly,  the regulation  were not	 made  under\nsection 64  of the  Maharashtra Industrial  Development Act,\n1961 [hereinafter  referred to as the &apos;Act&apos;] under which the\nrespondent-corporation was  created. Thereafter in 1988, the\ncorporation passed a resolution, for the first time,. making\n75 per	cent of	   the	posts  of  superintending  engineers\navailable to  the executive Engineers holding degrees and 25\nper cent  to  the  Executive  Engineers	 who  were  diploma-\nholders.  This	 resolution  was   also	 admittedly   not  a\nregulation made	 under the   said  section 64.	But for this\nresolution, the	 petitioner who was senior to respondent NO.\n2 would	 have been  promoted to	 the post  of Superintending\nEngineer on  31st October,  1990. However,  since respondent\nNo.2 was a degree holder, he got the said resolution and was\npromoted to the said post on that date. It is this promotion\nwhich was challenged by the petitioner by a writ petition in\nthe High  Court. The  High Court  by the  impugned  judgment\ndismissed the said petition.\n     2.	 Two   contentions  were  raised\n     before us.\n     (i) that no classification could be\n     made among	 the Executive Engineers\n     on the  basis of  their educational\n     qualification for	the  purpose  of\n     promotion	 to    the    post    of\n     superintending Engineer, since they\n     belong  to	  the  same   cadre   of\n     Executive Engineers and do the same\n     work.  There   was	 also  a  common\n     seniority	  of	the    Executive\n     Engineers	maintained.   hence  the\n     classification  was  discriminatory\n     in nature and violative of Articles\n     14 and 16 of the Constitution .\n     (ii)  that	  if  at   all	such   a\n     discrimination was	 permissible, it\n     could be  made only  be a statutory\n     rule  or  regulation  framed  under\n     Section 64	 of the said Act. A mere\n     resolution	   or	 an    executive\n     instruction could	not effect  such\n     discrimination.\n3.   We find  not merit in either of the two contentions. It\nis now	well settled  that for	the purpose  of promotion, a\nvalid classification  can made among the members holding the\nsame post  on the  basis of their qualification. In state of\nJummu &amp;	 Kashmir v.  Triloki Nath Khosa &amp; Ors., [1974] 1 SCR\n771, a Constitution Bench of his court has clearly held that\nsuch a	classification is  permissible and  does not violate\nArticles 14  and  16  of  the  Constitution  the  Court	 has\nobserved there that in state of Mysore &amp; Anr. v. P. Narasing\nRao, [1968]  1 SCR  407 and The Union of India and others v.\nDr.(Mrs.) S.B.	Kholi, AIR  1973 SC 811, it was already held\nthat   classification	 on   the   basis   of	 educational\nqualification was  permissible. The  Court then	 referred to\nRoshan Lal  Tandon v.  Union of India, [1968] 1 SCR  185 and\ndistinguished it  on the facts by pointing out that it was a\ncase of	 the direct  recruits and  promotees integrated into\none cadre.  Once they  were integrated they lost their birth\nbirth-marks, viz.  the different   sources  from which	they\nwere recruited.	 [Emphasis supplied].  The court pointed out\nthat Roshan Lal&apos;s case [supra] was thus no authority for the\nproposition that  if direct  recruits  and    promotees	 are\nintegrated into	 one class  they cannot	 be  classified	 for\npurposed of promotion on a basis other than that in the case\nbefore the them the classified for purpose of promotion on a\nbasis  other  than  that  they	were  drawn  from  different\nsources. The  court also  pointed out  that the	 very  Bench\nwhich decided  Roshan Lal&apos;s    case  [supra]  he Constitution of India, Art.14, Art.16 - Promotion to post of Superintending Engineer - Classification of degree-holder and confirmation holder Executive Engineers - Not violative Arts. 14 and 16. \r\n\r\nMaharashtra Industrial Development Act (3 of 1962), S.64. \r\n\r\nAIR 1983 SC 881, Held per incuriam. \r\n\r\nAIR 1974 SC 1, Foll. \r\n\r\nAdvancement - Classification among same class on premise of capabilities - Permissible. \r\n\r\nMaharashtra Industrial Development Act (3 of 1962), S.63 - Promotion to post of Superintending Engineer - Classification of degree holder and confirmation holder Executive Engineers - Made by Corporation by passing simple determination - Not illicit. \r\n\r\nAuthoritative law - Change in administration condition by passing simple determination - allowable. \r\n\r\nStates of Service - Can be changed by official guidelines.\r\n\r\nheld: The proposition that in the absence of the rules and regulations, the authority can act by executive instruction finds direct support in Mysore state Road Transport Corporation v.

As   far   as   the   remaining   land   of   143 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbighas   is   concerned,   even   the   Division   Bench   of   the   High \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCourt,   in   the   impugned   order,   remitted   the   matter   to   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRevenue Minister.  Inasmuch as the issue of remaining land of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n143   bighas   raised   by   the   respondents   is   pending   before   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nRevenue   Minister,   the   same   is   not   relevant   for   our   present \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(5)    It   is   the   contention   of   the   learned   counsel   for   the   State \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   the   order   dated   23.04.1969   about   the   grant   of   603.16 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbighas of land (including 460.15 bighas - the subject matter of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npresent proceedings) was ex facie without jurisdiction as it was \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nallotted   by   the  PHED  on  flimsy   and  fallacious   grounds  about \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncancellation   of   patta   way   back   in   the   year   1942   and   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompensation sought in the year 1968.   It is relevant to note \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat the same was cancelled way back in 1973.   Inasmuch as \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopportunity of hearing was not given, the learned single Judge \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof the High Court, by order dated 24.11.1976, remanded back \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto the State Government for     deciding the matter afresh after \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngiving due opportunity of hearing to the respondents herein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(6)    On   behalf   of   the   State,   it   was   pointed   out   that   it   has \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlegitimate   grievance   with   the   allotment   dated   23.04.1969   by \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  PHED.     The cancellation was made way back in the year \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1942   for   allotment   made   in   the   year   1941   on   the   ground   of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nviolation   of   lease   conditions.     The   respondents   have   claimed \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhuge   compensation   for   construction   said   to   have   been   made \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nduring   subsistence   of   lease   in   the   year   1949   itself   and   filed \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplication for compensation with regard to the cancellation of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npatta   in   the   year   1968.     According   to   the   State,   the   said \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplication   was   barred   by   limitation   and   it   was   also   filed \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbefore wrong forum, i.e., the PHED, when it should have been \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfiled   before   the   Land   Revenue   Department,   which   is   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappropriate Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(7)    It   is   also   the   grievance   of   the   State   that   the   allotment \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndated 23.04.1969  was cancelled on 01.05.1973,  however, the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHigh   Court   set   aside   the   same   on   24.11.1976   on   the   limited \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nground that there was violation of natural justice and directed \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   State   Government   to   decide   it   afresh   after   giving \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopportunity   of   hearing.     In   those   circumstances,   the   State \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwants to exercise its power under the Land Revenue Act read \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith the orders passed by the learned single Judge of the High \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCourt   dated   24.11.1976   and   the   Revenue   Minister   dated \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15.12.1992.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(8)    It   was   highlighted   that   the   judgment   of   the   trial   Court \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndated 30.06.1982 is also nullity since there was no discussion \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non   merits   with   regard   to   the   validity   of   allotment   dated \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n23.04.1969. Though it was pointed out by the counsel for the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrespondents that it was hit by the principle of  res judicata  as \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclarified by the counsel for the appellants, the principle of  res  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njudicata shall only apply if there is discussion or finding on the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsame   subject   matter.     A   perusal   of   the   decree   of   injunction \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   had   been   passed   on   23.04.1969   shows   that   it   did   not \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadvert to the merits of the case at all.  It is also not in dispute \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   the   subject   Property - Notice for reviewing - Objections against the notice for reviewing the request permitted by High Court - Hence, introduce claim - Held, arrive being referred to has a place with the Revenue Department of the State of Rajasthan and the PHED had no purview at all to reestablish 460.15 bighas of land for the Respondents - It was unnecessary to specify that while passing crisp requests as coordinated, the State Government needed to issue notice to every one of the gatherings concerned and choose the same as per law - Appeals permitted. Appeals Allowed','Dahyabhai Ranchhoddas Dhobi &amp; Anr Vs State Of Gujarat &amp; Ors P. Sathasivam, J.\n\n1) Leave granted.\n\n2) This appeal is directed against the judgment and order\n\ndated 12.01.2009 passed by the High Court of Gujarat at\n\nAhmedabad in Special Civil Application No. 5663 of 1990\n\nwith Civil Application No. 3458 of 2006 whereby the High\n\nCourt dismissed the petition preferred by the appellants\n\nherein.\n\n\n\n\n \n3) Brief facts:\n\na)   According to the appellants, they are owners of the\n\nland in question measuring 848.66 sq.m., Nandh No.\n\n2190/P, Ward No.4 of Surat City.        The State of Gujarat\n\ninitiated   acquisition   proceedings    under   the   Land\n\nAcquisition Act, 1894 (hereinafter referred to as the \"Act\")\n\nfor construction of a school in the land in question under\n\nthe Surat Municipal Corporation. The appellants objected\n\nto the said acquisition on the ground that:\n\n(i) this is the only land for them for carrying on the\n\nbusiness of washermen and they are using this land for\n\nthe purpose of their livelihood.\n\n(ii) There are vacant/open lands adjoining to the land in\n\nquestion.\n\n(iii) Within a radius of 1 km., number of schools are\n\navailable particularly being run by the Surat Municipal\n\nCorporation.\n\n\n\n\n \n(iv) While acquiring the land, the respondents have not\n\nfollowed the provisions of Sections 4, 5, 6 and 11A of the\n\nAct.\n\nb)     On the other hand, it is the stand of the State\n\nGovernment that:\n\n(i) the land is required for establishing a primary school by\n\nthe Surat Municipal Corporation.\n\n(ii) They fully complied with the statutory notices and\n\nother requirements.\n\n(iii) The appellants did not avail the opportunity of\n\nparticipating in the 5A enquiry by filing objections.\n\n(iv) The declaration made under Section 6 of the Act is\n\nwithin time.\n\n(v) Award under Section 11A has been passed within the\n\nstatutory period. Since the establishment of school is for\n\na public purpose and in view of compliance of all the\n\nstatutory formalities, there is no merit in the appeal and\n\nprayed for dismissal of the same.\n\n\n\n\n \n4)   Heard Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel for\n\nthe appellants and Mr. Prashant G. Desai, learned senior\n\ncounsel for the Surat Municipal Corporation and Ms.\n\nHemantika Wahi, learned counsel for the State of Gujarat.\n\n5)   Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel for the\n\nappellants has raised the following contentions:\n\na)   there was no hearing/enquiry in terms of Section 5A\n\nof the Act which is mandatory;\n\nb)   the locality publication was not effected under\n\nSection 6(2);\n\nc)   the Award passed under Section 11A was not made\n\nwithin two years from the date of last publication of\n\nnotification under Section 6, therefore the acquisition is\n\nvitiated;\n\nd)   after change of classification of the land in question,\n\nnamely, residential use, the respondents are not permitted\n\nto establish a primary school which is not permissible;\n\ne)   In view of the fact that the area being designated as\n\nresidential congested by houses on either side, it is not a\n\n \nfit place for establishing a school as observed by this\n\nCourt in Avinash Mehrotra vs. Union of India and\n\nOthers, (2009) 6 SCC 398.\n\n6)   On the other hand, Mr. Prashant G. Desai, learned\n\nsenior counsel for the Surat Municipal Corporation has\n\nsubmitted that in view of Section 12 (2) (b) and Section 20\n\n(1) of the Gujarat Town Planning &amp; Urban Development\n\nAct, 1976, the State Government is well within their\n\npowers in establishing a primary school in Surat.       He\n\nfurther submitted that all the statutory provisions have\n\nbeen strictly complied with and the declaration under\n\nSection 6 and Award under Section 11A were duly made\n\nwithin the prescribed time. Ms. Hemantika Wahi, learned\n\ncounsel appearing for the State, by drawing our attention\n\nto specific averments in the counter affidavit submitted\n\nthat the appellants having not filed objections in the\n\nenquiry under Section 5A, all the three modes of\n\npublication as contemplated under Section 6 were duly\n\npublished and made and Award passed within the\n\n \nprescribed period, there is no infirmity in the acquisition\n\nproceedings and prayed for dismissal of the appeal.\n\n7)   We    have    considered     the   rival   contentions   and\n\nperused the relevant materials.\n\n8)   With regard to the first objection as to enquiry under\n\nSection 5A of the Act though the appellants have stated\n\nthat they were not given an opportunity of being heard, in\n\nthe counter affidavit filed by the Special Land Acquisition\n\nOfficer,   Surat   before   the   High    Court    it   has   been\n\nspecifically asserted that notification under Section 4 in\n\nthe Official Gazette was published on 09.03.1989, public\n\nnotice displayed at the office of Mamlatdar of the\n\nconcerned Ward on 20.04.1989 and hearing of objections\n\nunder Section 5A was fixed on 20.05.1989. In para 4 of\n\nthe counter affidavit, the Land Acquisition Officer has\n\nspecifically stated that appellants were given several\n\nopportunities for hearing their objections from time to\n\ntime. The hearing was fixed on 29.05.1989, 05.06.1989,\n\n12.06.1989, 20.09.1989, 28.09.1989 and 16.10.1989 and\n\n \nthe appellants were heard through their lawyer Mr.\n\nKashyap H. Shukla.           In view of the above specific\n\ninformation the contention contrary to the same is liable\n\nto be rejected.\n\n9)   The second objection is that locality publication was\n\nnot effected under Section 6(2) of the Act.       In the same\n\ncounter   affidavit,   the   Land   Acquisition   Officer   has\n\nasserted that publication of notification under Section 6\n\nwas published in the Gazette dated 21.03.1990.          Public\n\nNotice displayed at the office of Mamlatdar of the\n\nconcerned Ward on 19.04.1990. In the light of the said\n\ninformation, the claim that no publication of notice in the\n\nlocality under Section 6(2) cannot be accepted.\n\n10) The third and the important objection relates to\n\npassing of Award under Section 11A. It is the stand of the\n\nappellants that Award was not made within two years\n\nfrom the date of last publication of Notification under\n\nSection 6 hence the acquisition is vitiated.      Since heavy\n\nreliance was placed on the said objection, it is useful to\n\n \nrefer Section 6 and Section 11A of the Act which reads\n\nthus:\n\n    \"6. Declaration that land is required for a public\n    purpose.- (1) Subject to the provision of Part VII of this Act,\n    when the appropriate Government is satisfied, after\n    considering the report, if any, made under section 5A, sub-\n    section (2), that any particular land is needed for a public\n    purpose, or for a Company, a declaration shall be made to\n    that effect under the signature of a Secretary to such\n    Government or of some officer duly authorized to certify its\n    orders and different declarations may be made from time to\n    time in respect of different parcels of any land covered by the\n    same notification under section 4, sub-section (1)\n    irrespective of whether one report or different reports has or\n    have been made (wherever required) under section 5A, sub-\n    section (2);\n\n    Provided that no declaration in respect of any particular\n    land covered by a notification under section 4, sub-section\n    (1)-\n\n    (i) published after the commencement of the Land\n    Acquisition (Amendment and Validation) Ordinance, 1967 (1\n    of 1967), but before the commencement of the Land\n    Acquisition (Amendment) Act, 1984 shall be made after the\n    expiry of three years from the date of the publication of the\n    notification; or\n\n    (ii) published after the commencement of the Land\n    Acquisition (Amendment) Act, 1984 shall be made after the\n    expiry of one year from the date of the publication of the\n    notification:\n\n    Provided further that no such declaration shall be made\n    unless the compensation to be awarded for such property is\n    to be paid by a Company, or wholly or partly out of public\n    revenues or some fund controlled or managed by a local\n    authority.\n\n    Explanation 1. - In computing any of the periods referred to\n    in the first proviso, the period during which any action or\n    proceeding to be taken in pursuance of the notification\n    issued under section 4, sub-section (1), is stayed by an order\n\n\n \nof a Court shall be excluded.\n\nExplanation 2. - Where the compensation to be awarded for\nsuch property is to be paid out of the funds of a corporation\nowned or controlled by the State, such compensation shall\nbe deemed to be compensation paid out of public revenues.\n\n(2) Every declaration shall be published in the Official\nGazette, and in two daily newspapers circulating in the\nlocality in which the land is situated of which at least one\nshall be in the regional language, and the Collector shall\ncause public notice of the substance of such declaration to\nbe given at convenient places in the said locality (the last of\nthe dates of such publication and the giving of such public\nnotice, being hereinafter referred to as the date of the\npublication of the declaration), and such declaration shall\nstate the district or other territorial division in which the\nland is situate, the purpose for which it is needed, its\napproximate area, and, where a plan shall have been made\nof the land, the place where such plan may be inspected.\n\n(3) The said declaration shall be conclusive evidence that the\nland is needed for a public purpose or for a company, as the\ncase may be; and, after making such declaration, the\nappropriate Government may acquire the land in manner\nhereinafter appearing.\n\n11A. Period within which an award shall be made.- (1) The\nCollector shall make an award under section 11 within a\nperiod of two years from the date of the publication of the\ndeclaration and if no award is made within that period, the\nentire proceeding for the acquisition of the land shall lapse:\n\nProvided that in a case where the said declaration has been\npublished before the commencement of the Land Acquisition\n(Amendment) Act, 1984, the award shall be made within a\nperiod of two years from such commencement.\n\nExplanation - In computing the period of two years referred\nto in this section, the period during which any action or\nproceeding to be taken in pursuance of the said declaration\nis stayed by an order of a Court shall be excluded.\"\n\n\n\n\n \n11) These provisions were considered by this Court in\n\nvarious decisions.       In Krishi Utpadan Mandi Samiti\n\nand Another vs. Makrand Singh and Others, (1995) 2\n\nSCC 497, the question that was posed for consideration\n\nwas whether the High Court was right in its conclusion\n\nthat the declaration under Section 6 was published after\n\nthree years and the last of the publications shall be the\n\nlast date for the purpose of computing three years&apos; period\n\nenvisaged in clause (i) of the proviso to sub-section (1) of\n\nSection 6 of the Act as amended by Land Acquisition\n\n(Amendment) Act, 1984. The discussion and conclusion\n\nin paras 4 and 5 are relevant:\n\n     \"4. The question, therefore, is that which date of the\n     publications in three steps i.e. publication in the Gazette,\n     two newspapers and local publication to be the last date for\n     the purpose of computing three years&apos; limitation prescribed\n     in clause (i) of the proviso to Section 6(1) of the Act. Prima\n     facie, it gives an impression that the last of any of the three\n     steps puts in motion, the running of limitation of three\n     years. But on deeper probe, it does not appear to be so and\n     such a construction would easily defeat the public purpose\n     and deflects the course of justice. So it is necessary to\n     understand the scheme and policy of the Act to get the crux\n     of the question. It is seen that sub-section (1) of Section 4\n     gives power of eminent domain to the State to acquire the\n     land, whenever it appears to it that the land is needed or\n     likely to be needed for any public purpose or for any\n     company, by a notification published in the Official Gazette\n\n\n \nand two daily newspapers circulating in that area and at\nleast one of them should be in the regional language and\nalso the Collector is enjoined to cause public notice of the\nsubstance of notification to be given at convenient places in\nthe said locality in which the land is situated. It is also\nmentioned thereunder that the last date of such publication\nand the giving of such public notice \"being hereinafter\nreferred to\" as the date of publication of the notification. It\nwould be seen that the purpose of notification under Section\n4(1) is an intimation to the owner or person having an\ninterest in the land that Government exercised the power of\neminent domain in relation to his land and for public\npurpose his land is needed or likely to be needed; puts an\nembargo on his freedom to deal with the land as an\nunencumbered land and also pegs the price of the land\nprevailing as on that date. It also is a caveat to the Collector\nto make the award under Section 11 as well as to determine\nthe market value prevailing as on the last of the dates to be\nthe date and the award should be made within a period\nprescribed by Section 11-A, lest the entire acquisition shall\nstand lapsed. The word `hereinafter&apos; is for such purposes as\nwell as for the purpose of determination of the compensation\nunder Chapter III of the Act as well. Therefore, the word\n`hereinafter&apos; referred to as the last date of the publication of\nthe notification is the date from which the prevailing prices\nof the land is to be computed etc.\n\n\n5. Clause (i) of the proviso to Section 6(1) mandates the\npublication of the declaration in the Official Gazette and it\nshould be within three years from the date of the publication\nof the notification under Section 4(1) i.e. the last of the dates\nreferred to in Section 4(1). The word `publish&apos; emphasises the\nact accomplished i.e. declaration under Section 6(1) being\npublished in the Official Gazette. The last date under Section\n6(2) shall be the date for the purposes \"hereinafter referred\nto\" would be not for computing the period of three years\nprescribed in clause (i) of proviso to Section 6(1) of the Act as\nit was already done, but purposes to be followed hereinafter.\nOtherwise language would have been \"hereinbefore done\".\nSub-section (2) as such did not prescribe any limitation\nwithin which the declaration under Section 6(1) or other\nsteps hereinafter to be taken, in other words, the steps to be\ntaken thereafter in making the award under Section 11 or in\ncomputation of the period prescribed in Section 11-A. The\npublication of the declaration in two daily newspapers\nhaving circulation in the locality one of which is in the\nregional language and the publication of the substance of\n\n\n \n    the declaration in the locality are ministerial acts and is a\n    procedural part. It appears that these publications are\n    required to be done to make the declaration published in the\n    manner, to be conclusive evidence of the public purpose\n    under Section 6(1) and also to provide limitation to make the\n    award under Section 11 by the Collector. In other words, the\n    limitation prescribed under Section 11-A is for the purpose\n    of making the award and if the Collector fails to do so, the\n    entire proceeds under Sections 4(1) and 6(1) shall stand\n    lapsed. If this consistent policy of the Act is understood\n    giving teeth to the operational efficacy to the scheme of the\n    Act and public purpose the Act seeks to serve, we are of the\n    considered view that publication in the Official Gazette\n    already made under clause (i) of proviso to sub-section (1) of\n    Section 6 is complete, as soon as the declaration under\n    Section 6(1) was published in the Official Gazette. That will\n    be the date for the purpose of computation of three years&apos;\n    period from the last of the dates of the publication of the\n    notification under Section 4(1). The procedural ministerial\n    acts prescribed under sub-section (2) are only for the\n    purpose of the procedure to be followed `hereinafter&apos;, in other\n    words, the steps to be taken subsequent to the publication of\n    the declaration under Section 6(1) of t Property - Validity of securing procedures - Sections 4, 5A, 6, 6 and 11A Land Acquisition Act, 1894 - Acquisition procedures were started under the Land Acquisition Act for development of a school on the land under the Surat Municipal Corporation - Appellants the proprietors, tested the obtaining on grounds procurement not done according to arrangements set down under the Act and honor was not made inside two years from the date of last production of Notification under Section 6 subsequently, the obtaining is vitiated - High Court rejected the request of favored by the Appellants - Hence exhibit Appeal — Whether High court was supported in expelling the appeal to favored by the Appellants - Held, notice under Section 4 in the Official Gazette was distributed, open notice was shown at the workplace of Mamlatdar of the concerned Ward and knowing about protests under Section 5A was additionally settled and the Appellants were given a few open doors for hearing their complaints now and again — Notification under Section 6 was keep going distributed on nineteenth April, 1990 and in this manner the time of two years stipulated in Section 11A would start to keep running from nineteenth April, 1990 and, along these lines, the distribution of the Award under Section 11 of the Act on eighteenth April, 1992 was inside the stipulated time point of confinement of two years - Land being referred to kept under booking for school in the endorsed improvement anticipate the State Government under Section 17 of the Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Act, it is the obligation of the Corporation to gain the land for actualizing the arrangements of the same - No Interference with the Order of High court - Appeal expelled \r\n\r\nProperty - \"Need\" and \"need\" - Appellant fought that in perspective of presence of many schools in and around the region, there is no compelling reason to build up a school in the place that is known for the Appellants - Held, In regard of \"need\" and \"need\", it is for the Government and their specialists to take a choice considering different angles - If such a choice is taken in view of materials it is not for the Court to question their case - Appeal expelled ','Arjun Singh Vs State Of H.P Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.\n\n\n\n\n1.    Leave granted.\n\n\n\n2.    Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a learned Single Judge\n\nof the Himachal Pradesh High Court upholding the conviction of the\n\nappellant for offences punishable under Sections 376, 511, 363 and 366 as\n\nwell as Section 109 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short the `IPC&apos;). He\nwas sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 7 years, 3 years, 4\n\nyears, 5 years and 7 years for the aforesaid offences alongwith fine with\n\ndefault stipulation.\n\n\n\n3.    Prosecution version as unfolded during trial is as follows:\n\n\n\n      On 18.7.1999, the victim (PW10) boarded the bus to Shimla from\n\nSolan. When the bus bearing registration No. HP-12-4113 reached near\n\npetrol pump (HIMFED) situated near Nav Bahar towards Chotta Shimla, all\n\nthe passengers got down, except the prosecutrix and accused-appellant\n\nArjun Singh. Accused Arjun Singh committed forcible sexual intercourse\n\nwith the prosecutrix against her will and without her consent. The victim\n\nwas kidnapped by the accused who was minor at the time of kidnapping in\n\nbus No.HP-12-4113 from Solan. The accused had induced the prosecutrix\n\nthat he would marry her after reaching Nalagarh. The FIR was registered.\n\nThereafter the investigation was carried out and the challan was put in the\n\nCourt. The appellant was charged for offences punishable under Sections\n\n376, 511, 366 and 109 of the Indian Penal Code. The prosecution examined\n\n15 witnesses to prove its case. The appellant had examined Shri Arvind\n\nSharma (DW 1) as defence witness. The learned Additional Sessions Judge,\n\n\n\n \nSolan, convicted and sentenced the accused as stated above. The sentences\n\nwere directed to run concurrently. It is to be noted that two persons faced\n\ntrial for the aforesaid offences i.e. appellant who was the conductor of the\n\nvehicle, and one Daler Singh who was the driver of the vehicle. Since\n\naccused persons abjured guilt, trial was held. The trial court placed reliance\n\non the evidence of the prosecutrix (PW1) and her mother (PW 3). As a plea\n\nrelating to the age of the prosecutrix to show that she was a consenting party\n\nwas taken, the person who had issued the date of birth certificate was\n\nexamined as PW 4. According to the said certificate the date of birth was\n\n19th October, 1984. She was admitted to the school on 1st April, 1997 and\n\nhad left it on 24th October, 1998. The trial Court held that the age of the\n\nvictim was less than 16 years and placed reliance on the documents\n\nproduced. It was also submitted by the accused persons that no rape has\n\nbeen committed. This plea also was rejected by the trial court.\n\n\n\n      Accordingly the trial court while holding the appellant guilty,\n\nacquitted co-accused. As noted above, appeal before the High Court was\n\ndismissed.\n\n\n\n\n \n4.    In support of the appeal the stand taken before the trial court and the\n\nHigh Court were reiterated.\n\n\n\n5.    Learned counsel for the respondent-State supported the judgment of\n\nthe High Court.\n\n\n\n6.    So far as the age aspect is concerned in Vishnu v. State of\n\nMaharashtra [2006(1) SCC 283] it was inter alia held as follows:\n\n\n                \"20. It is urged before us by Mr Lalit that the\n             determination of the age of the prosecutrix by\n             conducting ossification test is scientifically proved and,\n             therefore, the opinion of the doctor that the girl was of\n             18-19 years of age should be accepted. We are unable to\n             accept this contention for the reasons that the expert\n             medical evidence is not binding on the ocular evidence.\n             The opinion of the Medical Officer is to assist the court\n             as he is not a witness of fact and the evidence given by\n             the Medical Officer is really of an advisory character and\n             not binding on the witness of fact.\"\n\n\n\n\n7.    In State of Chhattisgarh v. Lekhram [2006(5) SCC 736] it was held\n\nthat the register maintained in a school is admissible evidence to prove the\n\ndate of birth of the person concerned in terms of Section 35 of the Indian\n\nEvidence Act, 1872 (in short `Evidence Act&apos;). It may be true that in the\n\nentry of the school register is not conclusive but it has evidentiary value.\n\n \n8.    Learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that the evidence of\n\nthe Doctor clearly rules out the commission of rape. The Medical officer\n\n(PW 9) has stated that rape had not been committed and sexual intercourse\n\nhad not taken place.\n\n\n\n9.    The offence of rape occurs in Chapter XVI of IPC. It is an offence\n\naffecting the human body. In that Chapter, there is a separate heading for\n\n`Sexual offence&apos;, which encompasses Sections 375, 376, 376-A, 376-B,\n\n376-C, and 376-D. `Rape&apos; is defined in Section 375. Sections 375 and 376\n\nhave been substantially changed by Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1983,\n\nand several new sections were introduced by the new Act, i.e. 376-A, 376-\n\nB, 376-C and 376-D. The fact that sweeping changes were introduced\n\nreflects the legislative intent to curb with iron hand, the offence of rape\n\nwhich affects the dignity of a woman. The offence of rape in its simplest\n\nterm is `the ravishment of a woman, without her consent, by force, fear or\n\nfraud&apos;, or as `the carnal knowledge of a woman by force against her will&apos;.\n\n`Rape&apos; or `Raptus&apos; is when a man hath carnal knowledge of a w (1) Indian Penal Code, 1860 - Sections 376, 511, 365, 366 and 109- - Rape, and so forth.- - Conviction and sentence - Whether subject to obstruction?- - Held, \"halfway\"- - Rape does not seem to have been conferred - But rather endeavor to submit assault - Clearly settled - Hence, offense under Section 376 not made out- - But rather that under Section 511 obviously made out- - In foundation of certainties of case, Section 109 has no application - Appellant properly indicted and sentenced for offenses under Sections 365, 366 and 511- - But his conviction under Sections 109 and 376 unsustainable- - But put aside. \r\n\r\n(2) Evidence Act, 1872- - Sections 3 and 9- - Appreciation of proof - Evidence of therapeutic officer on age- - Really of counseling character- - And not official on observer of actuality. ','Karnataka Industrial Areas Vs Nandi Cold Storage Pvt. Ltd J U D G M E N T I.A. NO.1 IN CIVIL APPEAL NO. 5542 OF 2004 Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.\r\n\r\n1. Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission at New Delhi (in short the &#39;National Commission&#39;). Respondent had filed a complaint against the appellant before the National Commission.\r\n\r\n2. Background facts in a nutshell are as follows:\r\n\r\n3. In the complaint respondent inter alia stated as follows:\r\n\r\nThe complainant company, desirous of opening a cold storage unit in the State of Karnataka, applied for allotment of land to the appellant in August 1991. After meeting all the formalities required from time to time by the appellant, a plot bearing No.2 of Chickballapur Industrial Area, measuring 2.5 acre of land, was allotted for setting up a cold storage. Possession certificate was issued on 26/30.8.93. The complainant also in the meantime obtained a loan of Rs.67 lakh from the Karnataka State Financial Corporation (in short &#39;KFC&#39;). For the first time in August 1994, a letter was written by appellant to the complainant that &quot;the company could not go ahead with construction activity on the plot allotted as the erstwhile land owner of plot No.2 covered in Sy.No.29 and 30 of Jadalathimmanahally Village has obtained stay order from the High Court of Karnataka in W.P.No.70/88 challenging the acquisition proceedings. The Board initiated action for vacating the stay order granted by the High Court of Karnataka. However, the company could not go ahead with implementation in view of the stay order granted by the High Court. The complainant sought for permission to go ahead with implementation after the litigation in respect of the above land is disposed of by the High Court. The Board should also grant extension of time to the company for implementation of the project after disposal of the litigation.\r\n\r\n4. Original land holder took back possession forcibly in view of the order of the Karnataka High Court. The writ petition filed by the original land holder was allowed by the High Court leaving the complainant high and dry without land, more so when in September 1994, the KFC cancelled the term loan in view of the fact that no progress was made in the implementation of the project. Since the complainant was keen to go ahead with the project, on collecting some information, it approached the appellant to allot plot No.1-A and 1-B which was lying vacant, which were allotted to the complainant in 1995. But it seems that bad luck had not stopped chasing the complainant. As soon as the allotment in respect of plot no.1- A and 1-B were made on a resumed plot, the original allottees moved the High Court making the complainant a party before it. However, after protracted litigation, the writ petition was dismissed but in the meanwhile the loans had been cancelled and the complain Consumer Protection Act, 1986 - Sections 2 (1) (g) and 21- - Deficiency in administration - Allotment of plot for setting up mechanical units- - About insufficiency in administration, adjust approach received by National Commission - However, remuneration conceded is on higher side- - Hence, decreased to Rs. one lakh from Rs. three lakhs.\r\n NA'), 'idx_court_decisions_0', '', 5 AS around, 300 AS limit)";i:1;i:80;i:2;s:21:"yii\db\Command::query";i:3;d:1579264312.883417;i:4;a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"file";s:68:"C:\xampp\htdocs\legal_mix\common\models\JudgmentMastSphinxSearch.php";s:4:"line";i:231;s:8:"function";s:8:"queryAll";s:5:"class";s:14:"yii\db\Command";s:4:"type";s:2:"->";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"file";s:65:"C:\xampp\htdocs\legal_mix\frontend\controllers\SiteController.php";s:4:"line";i:862;s:8:"function";s:16:"searchJudgements";s:5:"class";s:38:"common\models\JudgmentMastSphinxSearch";s:4:"type";s:2:"->";}}i:5;i:9579560;}i:54;a:6:{i:0;s:256071:"CALL SNIPPETS(('Babu Kuttan R.Pillai & Anr Vs State Of Maharashtraa11 LI.TTTTTTJ J U D G M E N T D.P. MOHAPATRA,J This appeal, filed by accused no.1 Babu Kuttan Ramkrishna Pillai and accused no.2 Umesh @ Babu Purshottam Bhatt of TADA ACT Spl.Case No.33 of 1994, is directed against the judgment and order dated 21.8.1998 of the Designated Court at Brihan `Mumbai under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 (for short TADA Act). In the said case seven accused persons faced trial under Section 120-B read with 307 r/w 34, 307 r/w 114, 307 r/w 149, 387 r/w 34, 143, 144, 147, 148 and 506 (ii), 353 r/w 114 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 3(2)(ii), 3(3), 3(5), 5 and 6 of the TADA Act and section r/w 25(IB)\r\n\r\n(a), Section 5 r/w 27 of the Arms Act. The gist of the prosecution case relevant for the purpose of this proceeding may be stated thus: With the growth of industry, commerce and trade in and around the city of Mumbai which generates substantial quantity of wealth, there has been increase of organised activities by gangs of anti-socials to extract money from affluent sections of society like developers, hoteliers and other businessmen by putting them in fear of death and then to demand substantial sums of money commonly known as &quot;Khadani&quot; i.e. protection money. One such gang was operating in the city under Amar Naik @ Bhai, who died a couple of years before the decision in the case at an encounter with the police. The prosecution alleged that in pursuance of a criminal conspiracy between 15.1.1994 to 16.5.1994 the accused persons and others of the gang embarked upon preparatory acts like procuring the information about the names of the builders of M/s Kalpataru Construction Company which was engaged in developing a property at Pali Hill, named Nakshatra Building. PW-7 Sudhir Tambe was the Senior Vice-President of the company with its head office at Nariman Point. He used to sit in the head- office. PW 6 Pachapur, Civil Engineer, was an employee of the company who used to remain at the site to supervise the construction. As the prosecution story runs, on 15.4.1994 between 11.30 a.m. and 12.00 noon while PW 6 was on duty at the construction site, accused no.3, Nitin Vasant Venugurlekar armed with revolver and accused No.4 Rajindera @ Rajan Mahadeo Margaj armed with a chopper and accused no.5 Jayendra @ Jai Anandrao Jadhav also armed with a chopper visited the site of Nakshatra Building; they threatened the workers at the site, forcibly brought PW 6 Pachapur in a room on the ground floor and man-handled him. Accused no.3, pointing a revolver at him demanded the name, address and telephone number of the builders. PW 6 disclosed the name of PW 7 Tambe and gave his telephone number to them. The accused then asked him to go to the office of the builders at Nariman Point and make the arrangement for a telephonic talk with Tambe. PW 6 rushed to the office and told Tambe of what had happened at the construction site. This was followed by telephonic calls from the accused who wanted to speak to Tambe. Attempts were made by PW 6 and PW 7 to avoid any discussion with the gangsters. Two or three days thereafter when the accused got Tambe on the telephone he (Tambe) gave them some other telephone numbers and asked them to contact those persons including one D.N.Ghosh, the Security Contractor. Eight/ten days thereafter again a telephone call was made to the office of Tambe which was received by PW 6 who was informed by the person making the call that they could not get D. N. Ghosh on the telephone numbers furnished by Tambe. Thereafter PW 6 handed over the receiver to Tambe. This incident was followed by several threats given by the gangsters to workers and also repeated telephone calls made to the Head Office of the company to contact Tambe. The staff of the site office absented from work resulting in virtual closure of construction activity. On 11.5.1994 the deceased Sanjay Patil telephoned to Tambe and warned him that he is wasting time and should meet him without further delay. After some days there was one more similar call from Sanjay Patil and he asked Tambe that he should talk to Bhai and saying so he handed over the receiver to another person who gave his identity as Amar Naik (since deceased), who told Tambe that he should pay Rs.10 lacs. The later pleaded his inability to pay such a heavy sum and after some discussion agreed to pay Rs.5 lacs. He was asked to come to Nakshatra Building site on 16.5.1994 along with money. In the meantime Tambe informed all the happenings to the Addl. Commissioner of Police Mr.Sanjeev Dayal and the then Dy. Commissioner of Police of Zone VII Mr. Rajanish Sheth within whose jurisdiction Khar Police Station fell.\r\n\r\nOn 16.5.1994 at about 12.00 noon the deceased Sanjay Patil telephoned Tambe and inquired from him as to what he was going to do about the payment and then Tambe replied that he will be leaving office at about 2.00 p.m. for Pali Hill. Sanjay Patil cautioned him that he should not make any haste and he should wait for his call so that he will take necessary instructions from his boss i.e. Amar Naik. At about 2.00 p.m. on that day there was a telephone call from Sanjay Patil telling that Tambe should not meet him at the Nakshatra Building site but instead he should meet him near the Ceaser Palace Hotel. This telephonic conversation was tape-recorded. Tambe was instructed on telephone that his man shall carry a white plastic bag containing the amount of Rs.5 lacs and shall wait near the entrance gate of Ceaser\r\n Indian Penal Code Section 120-B r/w 307, 34 likewise 307, r/w 114, 149 and 387 r/w 34, 143, 144, 147, 148 and 506(ii), 353 r/w 114 - Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 `TADA Act&#39; 25(IB)(a) - the Arms Act Section 5, 27 - Indian Penal Code, Section 120-B and 395 considered as saw - charged sentenced detainment for a long time - We do not find that the appreciation of evidence made by the learned trial Judge suffers from any illegality nor can findings recorded by him be said to be perverse- Appeal rejected.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n Appeal Dismissed','Jullundur Improvement Trust Vs Mohan Singh (Dead) By L.Rs. And Ors ORDER\r\n\r\n1. The respondents are the legal representatives of the deceased respondent..\r\n\r\n2. The Jullundur Improvement Trust was established and constituted under the Punjab Town Improvement Trust, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Improvement Trust&quot;). One of the duties and functions assigned to the trust is to frame development schemes for benefit of public. The improvement trust framed scheme known as &quot;development scheme&quot; for providing land to public within the municipal limits of Jullundur city. On 4.1.1970, the Trust resolved that the employees and trustees of the Jullundur Improvement Trust shall be granted residential accommodation on &quot;no profit no loss&quot; basis under the aforesaid scheme. It is not disputed that the plaintiff-respondent herein was one of the trustees of the improvement trust. On 22.1.1971, the plaintiff-respondent submitted an application for allotment of residential plot. While the said application was pending, the government 6y order dated 27.1.1971, directed that no trustee shall be allotted any plot of land in the development scheme formulated by the Improvement Trust at a reserved price. Despite that order of the state government, the trust by resolution dated 24.2.1971, resolved to allot a residential plot to the plaintiff-respondent subject to the approval of the state government. On 31.8.1971, a provisional letter of allotment of land was issued to the plaintiff-respondent. In pursuance thereof, it is alleged that the respondent deposited the price of the land. When the aforesaid fact came to the notice of the government, the government by letter dated 5.9.1972 called upon the improvement trust to show cause under what circumstances, the provisional allotment has been made in favour of the plaintiff-respondent. It is not disputed that the said scheme was subsequently not approved by the state government and it fell through. Under these circumstances, the plaintiff-respondent filed a suit for permanent injunction restraining the appellant herein from committing the breach of the alleged agreement and from cancelling the provisional allotment made i\r\n Trust and Societies - Contract - Specific help - Injunction - Improvement trust confined advancement conspire for giving area to open inside the civil furthest reaches of city - Employees and trustees to get convenience on no benefit no misfortune&quot; premise under the plan - Despite request of the state government that no trustee should be allocated any plot of land at a saved value, a determination gone by trust in which the offended party respondent partook and got a distribution of land - Scheme is no longer a subsisting plan as not endorsed by state Govt. - No closing contract has appeared between the litigant trust and the respondent - Relief of changeless directive looked for in the suit couldn&#39;t have been allowed by the trial court and insisted by the High Court - Sections 38, 39 and 41 of Specific Relief Act, 1963.\r\n Appeal Dismissed With Cost','Dasrath vs State Of M.P on 29 July, 2010 V.S. SIRPURKAR, J.\r\n\r\n1. The present appeal is directed against the judgment of the High Court dismissing the appeal of the appellant Dasrath. He was convicted by the Trial Court of the offence under Section 304B,&nbsp;Indian Penal Code&nbsp;(IPC) and was sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and pay a fine of Rs. 5,000/- and in default directed to suffer further imprisonment for one year. He was also convicted for the offence under&nbsp;Section 201,&nbsp;IPC&nbsp;and was directed to suffer rigorous imprisonment for one&nbsp;year with a fine of Rs.1,000/- and in default to suffer three month&#39;s further imprisonment.\r\n\r\n2. Initially, as many as three accused persons came to be tried by the Sessions Judge, they being accused No.1, Kalyan, accused No.2, Dasrath and accused No.3, Smt. Usha. While accused No.2, Dasrath is the present appellant, accused No.1, Kalyan Singh and accused No.3, Smt. Usha are his father and sister, respectively. The Trial Court had also convicted Kalyan Singh for the same offence. However, it acquitted accused No.3, Smt. Usha from all the charges. Both the accused had filed an appeal challenging their conviction and the sentences before the High Court. However, during the pendency of the appeal, accused No.1 Kalyan Singh expired and his appeal, thus, abated. The appeal of Dasrath, the present appellant came to be dismissed by the High Court and that is how he is before us.\r\n\r\n3. Shortly stated, the prosecution story was that Dasrath was married to Pinki who died under suspicious circumstance of burning. An intimation regarding death came to be given to the Police Station Pandhokhar, Distt. Gwalior. The said intimation was given by the complainant Vadehi Saran s/o Ramanand Kaurav who was none else but the father of the deceased Pinki. It was, inter alia, stated that on that day i.e. 12.8.1992 in the morning his son Jitendra Singh had gone to village Saujna for Rakhi&nbsp;festival to his daughter Pinki&#39;s house. But he returned at about 7 p.m. and told him that Pinki had caught fire and was sent to Daboh for treatment. Vadehi Saran further stated that on hearing the news, he along with some co-villagers went to Daboh. However, one Santosh belonging to his village met him near Dugdha Dairy and told him that Pinki had died. Then Vadehi Saran along with others went to village Saujna. But by the time they reached there, Pinki&#39;s cremation was over. It was because of this that they came to the Police Station and further action was requested on the basis of the death report.\r\n\r\n4. On this basis, a First Information Report was got registered on 16.8.92 wherein it was recorded that the death intimation was given on 12.8.92 at 23.15 hours orally about the death of Pinki. It was recorded on a preliminary inquiry made by Head Constable Jaswir Singh by visiting village Saujna and the Station House Officer R.S. Purohit had also made inquiries relating to the death. The place of occurrence was examined by SDOP R.K. Hirodia and inquiry was made from the deceased&#39;s father Vadehi Saran, uncle Uttam Singh, brothers Janved Singh and Jitendra Singh, mother Vidya Devi and sister Pratibha. During this inquiry, it was found that the deceased was married 2 years prior to the date of incident and because of the non-payment of dowry, her husband Dasrath, father-in- law Kalyan Singh and Sister-in-law Usha were harassing her. The earlier&nbsp;statement given by Vadehi Saran was repeated. It was then mentioned that on 12.8.1992 the sister-in-law Usha, husband Dasrath caught hold of Pinki and father-in-law Kalyan Singh poured kerosene oil on her and set her on fire because of which she got burnt. The accused thereafter cremated her and cleaned the place where occurrence had taken place.\r\n\r\n5. On the basis of this, further investigation ensued and after its completion, a charge-sheet came to be filed in the Court for offences under&nbsp;Sections 302,&nbsp;304&nbsp;B and 201&nbsp;IPC. The accused were charged accordingly. The prosecution, during the trial, examined as many as 11 witnesses. The accused persons abjured the guilt and as stated earlier only two of them came to be convicted, namely, Kalyan Singh and Dasrath. However, due to the death of Kalyan Singh during the pendency of the appeal, the appeal filed by Dasrath alone is to be considered.\r\n\r\n6. Learned Senior Counsel, Dr. J.N. Singh appearing on behalf of the accused attacked the judgment of both the Courts below, firstly, contending that conviction under&nbsp;Section 304B,&nbsp;IPC&nbsp;and Section, 201,&nbsp;IPC&nbsp;was wholly incorrect as it was not proved that Pinki had died a suspicious or un-natural death within the seven years of her marriage nor was her body found. He also contended that there was no question of demanding any dowry as no complaint was ever made for dowry nor was there any evidence regarding the demands of dowry. Lastly, he suggested that there&nbsp;was no question of any offence having been committed. He pointed out that the Trial Court had acquitted all the accused of the offence under&nbsp;Section 302,&nbsp;IPC&nbsp;though a charge was also framed under that Section and there was no appeal by the State Government against the acquittal under&nbsp;Section 302,&nbsp;IPC. Under such circumstances, it was clear that the accused persons could not be held responsible for the death of Pinki.\r\n\r\n7. As against this, Ms. Aishwarya Bhati, Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent pointed out that it could not be said that the death did not take place within seven years of marriage as the accused himself had admitted that the marriage had taken place six years prior to the trial. She further pointed out that there was a clear assertion made by the witnesses in their evidence. More particularly, Vadehi Saran (PW 4), Janved Singh (PW-5), Pratibha (PW-6) and Jitendra Singh (PW-8) had clearly asserted that the dowry was asked for by the accused persons. Learned Counsel further contended that if Pinki had died of burning, a report ought to have been made for un-natural death which the accused did not bother to make, instead they had cremated the body of Pinki without even intimating the relatives of the deceased and also without waiting for the police. This was the most suspicious circumstance which pointed towards the guilt of the accused.\r\n\r\n8. It is on the basis of these rival versions that it is to be seen as to whether the appellant Dasrath was rightly convicted for the offence.\r\n\r\n9. The first contention raised by the Learned Counsel for the defence regarding the corpus delicti not being found was countered by Ms. Bhati by saying that there can be no dispute about the death of Pinki. It is not the defence of the accused that Pinki was still living. On the other hand, the accused persons admittedly had cremated her body on the fateful day. Therefore, this is not a case, according to her, of corpus delicti not being found and, therefore, there being a serious suspicion about the death having taken place at all. The question is, in the absence of corpus delicti, could it be presumed that the accused persons alone were responsible for the death of Pinki. We must hasten to add here that the accused persons have already been acquitted of the murder charge. What remains to be seen is as to whether Pinki died an un-natural death within seven years of her marriage and whether her death was attributable to the demand of dowry and further whether she was dealt with cruelly soon before her death. If these ingredients are proved by the prosecution then the conviction of the accused under&nbsp;Section 304B,&nbsp;IPC&nbsp;will be complete.\r\n\r\n10. There can be no dispute that Pinki had died an un-natural death. In fact there is enough evidence to suggest that Pinki suffered the burn injuries. It is not the defence of the accused that she died a natural death.&nbsp;Both the Courts have very specifically held that Pinki suffered burn injuries and died because of the same. In fact Jitendra Singh (PW-8) was specific in his evidence that Pinki was burning on account of the kerosene having been poured on her body. In fact it is apparent from his cross-examination that when Pinki shouted, neighbours rushed to her house. There can be no dispute that this witness has been dis-believed and rightly so, insofar as his evidence about the accused deliberately burning Pinki is concerned. However, there can be no dispute that Pinki was burnt and it was clear that she had died an un-natural death. Again, it is clear from the report of the chemical analyzer that the kerosene residues were found from Packet-A which contained the clothes of Pinki which were seized during the investigation. Therefore, it is clear that Pinki&#39;s death was caused because of the burns and not in the normal circumstances. The finding of the Trial Court and the appellate Court in that behalf is correct. For this reason we are not impressed by the argument of the Learned Counsel that in the absence of corpus delicti, the conviction could not stand. Similarly, there can be no dispute that Pinki died within seven years of her marriage. Gandharv Singh (PW-1) had specifically asserted that the marriage was performed 3-4 years prior to the incident. Though this witness was declared hostile, at least the fact that marriage had taken place 3-4 years prior to the incident can be safely accepted. According to PW-2, Bhagwati Saran also the marriage had taken place within 5-6 years prior to trial.&nbsp;Again even this witness was declared hostile. However, that claim remained un-controverted. Third witness PW-3, Hari Saran asserted that the marriage was performed 6-7 years earlier to the date of his evidence. His evidence was in May, 1997 and even taking that the marriage took place somewhere in the year 1990, it would still be within seven years. Vadehi Saran, the father also said that the marriage had taken place 6-7 years prior to the date of his evidence which was again 30.09.1997. Therefore, according to his evidence even if the marriage could date back to the year 1987, it would still put the death of Pinki within seven years of her marriage.\r\n\r\n11. Therefore, it is certain that Pinki died an un-natural death by burning within seven years of her marriage. As regards dowry, Learned Counsel for the defence pointed out that there was no specific evidence nor was any allegation made in the First Information Report. We are not much impressed as we have seen from the evidence that there were demands of Buffalo made to Vadehi Saran, father of Pinki who did not accept that demand. Vadehi Saran has also specifically stated in his evidence that after 1 = years of the marriage when he went to the house of Pinki in the month of Shravan, door was closed and the appellants were beating Pinki and that the floor was smeared with blood and blood was also oozing out from the mouth of Pinki. He also asserted about the demand of a large&nbsp;size television as the television which was given in marriage was a small colour television. This evidence of torture is well supported by the evidence of Pratibha (PW-6), Anant Ram Singh (PW-7) and Uttam Singh (PW-9). In view of this, the Trial court and the appellate Court have recorded that, firstly, Pinki died an un-natural death because of burning within seven years of her marriage and, secondly concluded that she was subjected to cruelty and harassment by her husband and/or relatives in connection with the demand for dowry and that she was subjected to cruelty soon before her death.\r\n\r\n12. Similar is the case as regards the offence under&nbsp;Section 201,&nbsp;IPC. In fact it was incumbent upon the accused persons to firstly, inform the police about the un-natural death of Pinki. They did not do so. On the other hand, even after her death, they did not inform either the police or even the relatives like her father etc., though they could have done so. In stead they hurriedly conducted the funeral thereby causing destruction of evidence.\r\n\r\n13.&nbsp;In State of Rajasthan v. Jaggu Ram&nbsp;[2008 (12) SCC 51], this Court has considered the circumstance about the non-information to the parents and the hurried cremation. This was also a case where accused persons were tried for offence under&nbsp;Section 304B,&nbsp;IPC, where the accused, after the death of the unfortunate lady did not bother to inform her parents. In&nbsp;paragraph 26, this Court took a serious note of the manner in which the body was disposed of. The Court observed &quot;the disposal of the dead body in a hush-hush manner clearly establishes that the accused had done so with the sole object of concealing the real cause of death of Shanti @ Gokul.&quot;\r\n\r\n14.

Officers J U D G M E N T ARUN KUMAR, J.\r\n\r\nThe forest service in the State of Orissa was constituted under the&nbsp;Indian Forest Act, 1927 and the Madras Forest Act, 1882. However, in 1972 the State had its own&nbsp;Forest Act. The primary object of the legislation was protection and management of forests in the State. The words &#39;forest officer&#39; have been defined under the Act to mean persons whom the State Government, or any officer empowered by it in this behalf, may appoint to carry out all or any of the purposes of the Act. A forest officer would include the Principal Chief Conservator of Forest as well as subordinates like Conservator of Forests, Forest Range Officers, Deputy Rangers and Foresters. In the year 1979 the State of Orissa adopted the Antyodaya Programme of the Central Government. Under the said programme Social Forestry Projects were undertaken which envisaged contact with the poorest of poor farmers to educate and train them in matters connected with farming. For purpose of the Social Forestry Projects, ex cadre posts of Forestry Extension Officers (for short &#39;FEOs&#39;) were created by the State Government. These were project related posts and their expenses were met from special funds raised for the project. The project was for specific purpose and for a specific period and was funded by the Central Government. The duration of the project was, however, extended from time to time in order to fulfil its objective.\r\n\r\nThe recruitment for the posts of FEOs was to be made from the open market. The officers were to be given training in raising of seedlings, nursery work etc. so that when they go to the field they could properly motivate and educate the farmers. The minimum qualification prescribed for FEOs was Intermediate with Botany as a subject. After recruitment these officers were to be posted in blocks wherein forestry extension work was undertaken. Certain blocks within the State were selected for such extension work as a part of the Forestry Extension Programme. The FEOs were envisaged as somebody remaining in touch with small farmers at the lowest level in each village block and assessing their requirements of forest species and other species. The respondents were recruited as Forestry Extension Officers under the Project from 1979 onwards. The respondents claim that they should be treated as part of the forest service under the Forest Department of the State Government and the posts held by them should have equal pay and equal status with the equal level posts in the Forest Department. They further claim that the posts held by them should be included in the channel of promotion to higher posts in the forest Department. The grievance of the respondents is that they have been stagnating in the posts of FEOs to which they were recruited nearly twenty years ago. According to them though the project has senior level posts of Social Forestry Supervisors but these posts are being filled by getting officers from forest service of the State Government on deputation, thereby the posts are being denied to them. In the matter of pay scales the grievance of the FEOs is that they are being equated with foresters who are neither as qualified as they are nor the foresters discharge such important functions as they are discharging. The minimum educational qualification prescribed for the post of forester in the quota meant for direct recruits at the relevant time was Matriculation only. The FEOs are trained to motivate people under Social Forestry Projects which requires contact with individual farmers and working at the grass root level. On the other hand, officers of the Forest Department of the State are mainly concerned with protecting forests, including forest property, preventing illegal felling of trees, keeping a check on forest contractors in order to ensure that forest produce is not illegally exploited and removed, prevention of poaching of forest animals etc..\r\n\r\nIn the year 1990, some of the Forest Extension Officers (FEOs) approached the Orrisa Administrative Tribunal for purposes of relief with regard to the above demands. In fact, before approaching the Tribunal they had made representation to the Government which did not yield any result. This Original Application was disposed of by the Orissa Administrative Tribunal vide order dated 7.9.1995. The Tribunal noted that the government was alive to the grievance being aired by the FEOs. It directed the State Government to decide the question of fixation of pay scales of FEOs within six months. The Association of the FEOs was allowed an opportunity to be heard by the officers of the State Government who would be taking such a decision on behalf of the government. The Tribunal further observed that when the question of pay scales would be considered, the question of promotional avenues should also be taken into consideration. It appears that nothing happened in pursuance of the said direction of the Tribunal. The Association of FEOs again approached the Tribunal by way of an application in the year 1996. The main grievance of the Association was that inspite of the FEOs being well qualified, they were being made to stagnate as there were no chances of promotion to higher posts available for them. The other grievance was about not getting appropriate scale of pay. The respondents claim that they should be treated as equivalent to Forest Rangers and the scale of pay and service benefits given to Forest Rangers should be available to them also.\r\n\r\nThe Tribunal noted that the nature of duties performed by FEOs and the Foresters could not be compared because the two were entirely different. Similarly, the method of recruitment and the basic qualifications required for eligibility to the two posts were different. However, the grievance of the FEOs could not be overlooked. Undoubtedly, the FEOs were not getting any chances of promotion nor they were getting the pay scales commensurate to the duties and functions being performed by them. Having regard to these aspects the Tribunal directed that those FEOs who have put in more than ten years of service as FEOs should be treated at par with the post of Deputy Ranger in the state forest service and placed in the same scale of pay which is now applicable to Deputy Rangers. They should also be made eligible for promotion to the posts of Forest Rangers. Those FEOs who have put in less than ten years of service may be treated at par with Foresters and be made eligible for promotion as Deputy Rangers. The Tribunal noted that it was stated in the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the Government in the proceedings before the Tribunal that steps were being taken for movement of the FEOs to other divisions so as to induct them into the mainstream. The Tribunal expected that this movement should start which would result in FEOs with more than ten years of service being posted as Deputy Rangers when they are moved from Social Forestry Section and others should be posted as Foresters. In view of the averments in the counter affidavit the Tribunal recommended to the State Government that the exercise in terms of the above directions should start without further delay so as to equip the FEOs for their induction into the mainstream whenever the Social Forestry Welfare Scheme is abolished. The order of the Tribunal also contained a direction that in future vacancies for Forest Rangers and Deputy Rangers quotas should be earmarked for FEOs with more than ten years of service and FEOs with less than ten years of service respectively. The Tribunal directed the State Government to complete the exercise within four weeks.\r\n\r\nThe State Government issued an order on 19th May, 1998 carrying out the directions contained in the aforesaid judgment of the Orissa Administrative Tribunal. Those Forest Extension Officers who had put in more than ten years of service were to be treated at par with Deputy Rangers and placed in the same pay scale i.e. 1200-30-1560-EB-40-2040. Since out of 105 Forestry Extension Officers, 100 had already completed more than ten years of service as FEOs they were to be declared Senior Grade Forestry Extension Officers and were to be made eligible for promotion to the post of Forest Ranger. Those FEOs who had rendered less than ten years of service were to be treated at par with Foresters. The order contained further details about how the various quotas were to be worked out and postings were to be made.\r\n\r\nOne of the Foresters, under an apprehension that FEOs belonging to the Social Forestry Projects were being merged with the mainstream forest service of the State, approached the State Administrative Tribunal in the year 1998 seeking a declaration that Forestry Extension Officer do not belong to the cadre of the state forest service and that they should not be promoted to the posts of Deputy Rangers. The case of the applicant before the Tribunal was that the Social Forestry Project was a project scheme and the FEOs appointed under that scheme held ex-cadre posts. They were appointed to execute the Project and, therefore, they had nothing to do with regular forest service under the State Government. Since they were holding ex-cadre posts they could not claim promotion to the posts under the cadre. The Tribunal in its order dated 27th January, 1999 found that the apprehension of the petitioner before it was totally misplaced. The Forestry Extension Officers were being given only the pay scales of the equivalent posts in the State Government. Giving equivalent pay scales did not mean that they were being merged with the forest service of the State Government. Similarly regarding their promotions to the posts of Senior Social Forestry Extension Officer, their identity was being kept separate. The equivalence was provided only qua the scales of pay. The Tribunal noted:\r\n\r\n&quot;6. There is nothing in the letter of 19th May, 1998 to show that at any point of time the posts of Social Forestry Extension Officers or Senior Grade Social Forestry Extension Officers on one side and the Deputy Rangers and Foresters on the other have been made interchangeable posts. In order to give incentive to the Extension Officers only a separate channel of promotion has been creatd for them. Neither an Extension Officer can claim a post of Deputy Ranger nor a Forester can claim the post of Senior Grade Forestry Extension Officer.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe Tribunal further observed:\r\n\r\n&quot;7. However, in sub-para (i) of paragraph 1 of the said letter there is an observation that the forestry Extension Officer with more than 10 years of service should be posted as Deputy Ranger when it is proposed to move them out of the Social Forestry Directorate and others having less than ten years of service may be posted as Foresters. We are of the vie that since the government do not intend to make the posts interchangeable, this observation cannot be accepted as reasonable. Until the Extension Officers and Senior Extension Officers are regularly absorbed in the cadre of Foresters and Deputy Rangers and Rangers, they cannot be allowed to hold the posts of Ranger/Deputy Ranger or Forester. We, therefore, advise the State Government to frame a scheme or rules for their absorption in the Forest Department in the event of the abolition of the Directorate of Social Forestry. Until then, the Extension Officers shall not be brought over to the cadre of Foresters and Deputy Rangers. In case the Government desire that the Senior Grade Forest Extension Officer should also have further promotional facility, it is open to the State Government to consider and create appropriate promotional posts for them.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe above order was passed on 27th January, 1999. The State Government filed a Special Leave Petition in this Court challenging the earlier order of the Tribunal dated 5th March, 1997 in the first week of November, 2000 without even making a reference to the subsequent order dated 27th January, 1999. Thus the order dated 27th January, 1999 has not been challenged by any party. Leave to appeal was granted in the Special Leave Petition and the matter was registered as Civil Appeal No.1079 of 2001 which is being disposed of by this order.\r\n\r\nDuring the pendency of this Civil Appeal the Government of Orrisa passed a resolution dated 8th August, 2003 re-organising the field establishments of the Forest and Environment Department under the &#39;Forestry and Wildlife&#39; wing by abolishing the Afforestation and Social Forestry Division and Circles and creating a number of Territorial and Wildlife Divisions and Circles. Further the resolution abolishes certain establishments including the Social Forestry Department. The staff of the Departments which were being abolished was deployed within the remaining establishments. The said resolution provides that the Government had decided to abolish eighteen establishments under the control of Director, Social Forestry Project with which we are concerned in the present case. With the abolition of eighteen establishments of Social Forestry Project, the staff of the establishments is to be deployed in the Divisions/Circles/State Forest Headquarters as per the plan given in the resolution. The resolution came into effect on the date it was issued i.e. 8th August, 2003 and provides that the reorganization exercise was to be completed by 30th September, 2003. The exercise had started and in pursuance thereof a Memo dated 24.10.2003 was issued. None of the parties appearing before us have disputed the said resolution. In fact, an affidavit was filed in the present proceedings on behalf of the respondent Association bringing the said resolution on record. The respondents further stated that in view of the resolution dated 8th August, 2003 the points sought to be raised by the Government in the present appeal were no longer available to it. By the said resolution the members of the respondent-association i.e. Forest Extension Officers (FEOs) who were working under the Social Forestry Projects had been taken into the mainstream i.e. into the Forest Department of the Government of Orissa called the Territorial and Wildlife Division. The Social Forestry Directorate stands abolished. It is a resolution of the State Government. Naturally the learned counsel for the appellant, i.e. the State of Orissa accepts the resolution. In view of these developments the FEOs have ceased to be officers working against a particular project. They have become part of the forest service of the State Government. Their grievances do not survive any more. We have also heard the learned counsel appearing for some of the forest service officers who had intervened in these proceedings. He has tried to canvas that the position of his clients should not be adversely affected due to the merger. As at present he could not spell out any cause for worry for his clients. In any case, in the event of any prejudice being caused to the interveners, they will have independent cause of action for which they are free to pursue their remedies. So far as the State Government is concerned, it is bound by its resolution and, in fact, has taken steps to implement the same. Nothing survives in this appeal. The same is accordingly dismissed as having become infructuous.

The Commissioner of Gift Tax, Kerala, has appealed to this Court. Held: Court is unable to agree with the views so expressed. The donor is exempt under s. 5 (1) (xiv) from liability to pay tax only if the gift is in the course of carrying on a business, pro fession or vocation and is made bona fide for the purpose of such business, profession or vocation. The clause does not enact that a gift made by a person carrying on any business is exempt from tax, nor does it provide that a gift is exempt from tax merely because the property is used for the purpose for which it was used by the donor. Without deciding whether the test of commercial expediency&quot; is strictly appropriate to the claim 3 76 for exemption under S. 5 ( 1 ) (xiv), we are of the view that there is no evidence on the record to prove that the gift to Thomas was &quot;in the course of carrying on the business&quot; of the donor, and &quot;for the purpose of the business&quot;. The appeal is allowed and the order passed by the High Court is set aside. The Commissioner of Gift Tax will get his costs in this Court and the High Court.

The accused persons are the father and brother respectively of the deceased. The incident purportedly took place on 3.1.1990. Though the prosecution relied on the evidence of many persons who supposedly witnessed the occurrence, while deposing in Court, most of them resiled from the statements made during investigation. The version projected by the prosecution was that the deceased was throttled and also poison was administered to him. But the report of the Forensic Science Laboratory stated that the viscera did not contain any poison. The prosecution, therefore, gave up its stand that the deceased was administered poison by the accused persons. There were purportedly some extra-judicial confessions on which the Trial Court relied. Accordingly, the accused persons were convicted for offences punishable under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short &#39;IPC&#39;).

Subhashini for the Respondents.\n     The Judgment of the Court was delivered by\n     RANGANATHAN, J.  The seeds	 of the	 present controversy\nwere sown  as early  as in 1946. It is unfortunate that this\nmatter should  be  coming  up  before  this  Court  for	 its\nconsideration nearly  five decades  later, though it must be\npointed out  that the  issue in	 its  present  form  is	 the\noutcome of an amendment made by the Finance (No.2) Act, 1980\n(hereinafter referred  to as  &apos;the 1980	 Act&apos;) to the Income\nTax Act,  1961* (hereinafter referred to as &apos;the 1961 Act&apos;).\nIt is also a curious co-incidence that the 1980 Act effected\ntwo amendments in the 1961 Act with retrospective effect and\nthe validity  of both  these provisions have been challenged\nbefore the courts. The first was the controversy with regard\nto the	retrospective amendment	 of s.80-J which was settled\nby this	 Court by its decision in Lohia Machines Limited  v.\nUnion of India, (1985) 152 I.T.R. 308 (SC). It is the second\namendment to  the provisions  contained in  section 35(2) of\nthe 1961  Act that has given rise to the present controversy\nbetween the parties.\n     The question  is really  one of  interpretation of	 two\nimportant provisions relating to the computation of business\nincome for  purposes of	 income tax.  We may  start with the\nprovisions of  the Indian  lncome Tax Act, 1922 (hereinafter\nreferred to  as the &apos;1922 Act&apos;). The computation of business\nincome for  purposes of	 income tax  was done  in accordance\nwith the  provisions of	 section 10  of the said Act. In the\nprocess of making such computation, the Act provided for two\nimportant deductions  (among  others),	in  respect  of	 the\ncapital assets	employed in  the business. The first was the\ndeduction under clause (vi) of Section 10(2) of an allowance\nin respect of the depreciation of building, machinery, plant\nor furniture being the property of the assessee and used for\nthe purposes  of the business, at a prescribed percentage of\nthe written  down value	 of such  assets. This	allowance is\ncalculated, in	respect of  the year  of acquisition  of the\nproperty, at a percentage of its actual cost to the assessee\nand in subsequent years at a graduated scale on the basis of\nthe actual  cost less the depreciation allowances granted in\nthe preceding years. In strict principle, this is an\nallowance of  capital nature but it is now well settled that\nthe allowance  of depreciation	has to be taken into account\nin order  to ascertain	the true  profits of a business and,\ntherefore, an  assessee	 is  permitted	to  deduct,  in	 the\ncomputation of	the business  income year  after  year,	 the\nprescribed percentage  of the  value of	 the assets used for\nthe purposes of business. The second allowance was not there\nin the 1922 Act originally and was introduced by the Income-\ntax (Amendment)	 Act, 1946.  The introduction was of certain\nallowances  in	 respect  of   expenditure  on.	 \"scientific\nresearch related  to the  business\", an expression which was\ndefined in  a fairly  comprehensive manner  by the  statute.\nThree types  of allowances were permitted in respect of this\ncategory of  expenditure of which we are here concerned with\nonly one.  This provision  was contained  in clause (xiv) of\nS.10(2) which permitted a deduction.\n     \"in respect of any expenditure of a\n     capital   nature	 on   scientific\n     research related  to the  business,\n     an allowance  for each  of the Five\n     consecutive     previous	   year.\n     beginning	 with the  year in which\n     the expenditure  was  incurred,  or\n     where the	expenditure was incurred\n     prior to  the commencement	 of  the\n     business,	for  each  of  the  five\n     consecutive     previous	   years\n     beginning with  the year  in  which\n     the business  was commenced,  equal\n     2to one-fifth of such expenditure:\n     Provided that no allowance shall be\n     made for  any expenditure	incurred\n     more than	three years  before  the\n     commencement of the business:\n     A Provided further that-\n      XXX   XXX	    XXX\n     (d) where	a deduction  is	 allowed\n     for any  previous year  under  this\n     clause in	respect	 of  expenditure\n     represented wholly or partly by any\n     asset,  no	  deduction   shall   be\n     allowed under clause (vi) or clause\n     (vii) for the same previous year in\n     respect of that asset;\n     (e) where	an asset  is used in the\n     business after it ceases to be used\n     for scientific  research related to\n     that business,  and a  claim for an\n     allowance	under	clause	(vi)  or\n     clause (vii)  is made in respect of\n     that asset,  the actual cost to the\n     assessee  of  the	asset  shall  be\n     treated as reduced by the amount of\n     any deductions  allowed under  this\n     clause;\"\n     A cursory	and conjoint  reading of  section 10(2) (vi)\nand section  10(2) (xiv)  suggests that	 where	an  assessee\nincurs	expenditure   of  a  capital  nature  on  scientific\nresearch related to the business and the expenditure results\nin the	acquisition of	an asset,  the assessee	 can  claim,\nunder clause  (vi), a  deduction of the specified percentage\nof the	written down  value of	the asset   and under clause\n(xiv) he can ask for a deduction, in five consecutive years,\nof the expenditure he has incurred on the acquisition of the\nasset. For  this purpose, we are assuming that an asset used\nfor scientific research related to the business is also ipso\nfacto an  asset used  for the purpose of business. There has\nbeen some  debate before  us as to whether this is always so\nbut we need not enter into that controversy for the purposes\nof the present case.\n     It will  at once  be seen that, if these two provisions\nare applied   simultaneously, it would result in granting an\nassessee  a   double  allowance	  in  respect  of  the	same\nexpenditure -  one of  the entire amount over a period	of 5\nyears and  the other  a percentage of the expenditure over a\nnumber .  consecutive years  at a  graded scale	 as  already\nmentioned. The	question at  once leaps	 to the	 mind as  to\nwhether it  could have been the intention of the legislature\nto  permit   both  these  deductions  simultaneously  to  an\nassessee. The  provisions of  clauses (d)  and	(e)  of	 the\nproviso to  S.10(2) (xiv)  contain a  clue  to	answer	this\nquestion. More about it later.\n     We next  turn to  the provisions of 1961 Act. The topic\nof depreciation	 is dealt  with by section 32. Section 32(1)\n(ii) provides for depreciation. As under the 1922 Act, it is\nallowed at a percentage of the written down value of certain\ncapital assets	employed in  the  bussiness.  The  topic  of\nscientific research expenditure is dealt with by section 35.\nSection 35(1)  provides for  the deduction  of four types of\nexpenditure on	scientific	research  and  what  we	 are\nconcerned with is the deduction provided under section 35(1)\n(iv), which is to the following effect:\n     (iv) in  respect of any expenditure\n     of a  capital nature  on scientific\n     research related  to  the	business\n     carried on	 by the	 assessee,  such\n     deduction	as   may  be  admissible\n     under  the	    provisions	of  sub-\n     section (2).\"\n     Sub-section (2)  provides that,  for  the	purposes  of\nclause (iv)of  sub-section (1),	 one-fifth  of	the  capital\nexpenditure incurred  in any previous year shall be deducted\nfor that  previous year;  and the balance of the expenditure\nshall be  deducted in  equal instalments in each of the four\nimmediately  succeeding	  previous  years.   There   is	  an\nexplanation which  is not relevant for our present purposes.\nReading S.35(2) further, it provides in clauses (iv) and (v)\nas follows:\n     \"(iv) where  a deduction is allowed\n     for any  previous year  under  this\n     section in	 respect of  expenditure\n     represented wholly	 or partly by an\n     asset,  no	  deduction   shall   be\n     allowed under clauses (i), (ii) and\n     (iii) of sub-section (1) of section\n     32 for  the same  previous year  in\n     respect of that asset;\n     (v) where	the asset  mentioned  in\n     clause (ii) is used in the business\n     after it  ceases  to  be  used  for\n     scientific research related to that\n     business,	depreciation   shall  be\n     admissible under  clauses (i), (ii)\n     and  (iii)	  of  sub-section(1)  of\n     section 32.\"\nReference must	also be made to Explanation 1 to s. 43(1) in\nthis context. It read as follows at the relevant time:\n     \"Explanation:  Where  an  asset  is\n     used in business after it ceases to\n     be	 used  for  scientific	research\n     related  to  that	business  and  a\n     deduction	has  to	 be  made  under\n     clause (i),  clause (ii)  or clause\n     (iii) of  sub-section (I)	or  sub-\n     section  (1A)   of	 section  32  in\n     respect of	 that asset,  the actual\n     cost of  the asset to the assessee,\n     as reduced	 by the	 amount	 of  any\n     deduction allowed under clause (iv)\n     of sub-section (1) of section 35 or\n     under any	corresponding  provision\n     of the  Indian Income-tax Act, 1922\n     (11 of 1922).\"\n     From the  above it	 will be seen that the provisions of\nSection 32(1)  (ii) and	 Section 35(2) (i) (iv) and (v) read\nwith  Explanation   1  to   s.43(1)  virtually	 repeat	 the\nprovisions contained in Section 10(2) (vi) and 10(2)(xiv) of\nthe 1922  Act, so  that the  question  earlier	posed  still\nloomed in the  background of 1961 Act.\n     In 1968  there was	 an amendment  in the  provisions of\nSection 35(2).	The  sub-section  was  amended	to  read  as\nfollows:\n     \"(2) For  the  purposes  of  clause\n     (iv) of sub-section (1),-\n     (i) in  a case  where such	 capital\n     expenditure is  incurred before the\n     1st day  of April,	 1967, one-fifth\n     of the capital expenditure incurred\n     in	 any   previous	 year  shall  be\n     deducted for  that	 previous  year;\n     and the  balance of the expenditure\n     shall   be	   deducted   in   equal\n     instalments for  each of  the  four\n     immediately   succeeding	previous\n     years;\n     (i-a) in  a case where such capital\n     expenditure is  incurred after  the\n     31st day  of March, 1967, the whole\n     of	  such	  capital    expenditure\n     incurred in any previous year shall\n     be	 deducted   for	 that	previous\n     year.\"\n     The effect	 of this amendment was only to provided that\nthe  entire   amount  of  capital  expenditure	incurred  in\nrelation to  scientific research  was allowed as a deduction\nin one	year instead  of being	spread over a period of five\nyears as  was the  position earlier. This amendment does not\ntouch the   controversy	 in issue  before us  and it  has no\nsolution to offer to our present difficulty.\n     The provisions  of Section	 10(2) (vi) and (xiv) of the\nold Act	 had been administered between 1946 and 1962 and the\nprovisions of  Section 32  and 35  of the 1961 Act have been\nadministered since  1962. The  question	 whether an assessee\ncan  simultaneously  claim  an	allowance  or  deduction  in\nrespect of  the same  expenditure once	under Section 32 and\nagain in   Section 35 must have cropped up in some cases and\ndoes appear that such a double claim was put forward in some\ncases. The  contention on  behalf of  the assessees was that\nthe allowances	in respect  of depreciation  on the one hand\nand in respect of capital expenditure on scientific research\non the other are two totally different and independent heads\nof allowances.	 one  is a notional allowance to provide for\nthe wear  and tear  of	a  capital  asset  employed  in	 the\nbusiness as the years roll by; the other is an allowance for\nactual expenditure  of a  capital nature granted, on the eve\nof our	country&apos;s independence,	 in order  to give fillip to\nnew industrial innovations and the development of indigenous\nknow-how and  techniques by  proper planning on research and\ndevelopment by	various business  houses. It  is   therefore\nsuggested that	there is  nothing absurd  in construing	 the\nstatutes act  as providing  cumulatively for  both types  of\ndeductions in  respect of  the same  capital asset. The only\nlimitations on	this right are the two placed by the statute\nitself. The first limitation, contained in clause (d) of the\nproviso to  Section 10(2)  (xiv) and  s.35(2) (iv)  is	that\nboth the deductions cannot be claimed \"for the same previous\nyear\" in  respect of  the same	capital	 asset.	 The  second\nlimitation is found in clause (e) of the proviso  to Section\n10(2) (xiv)  and s.35(2)  (v) which  say that  if a  capital\nasset used  for scientific research ceases to be so used but\nis thereafter  brought into a  business for use therein, the\nactual cost for purposes of granting depreciation in respect\nof the asset thereafter should be taken as the amount of its\noriginal cost  reduced by  the amount  of deductions allowed\nunder Section  10(2) (xiv)  or s.35(2).	 In other words, the\ncontention of the assessee was and is that both the types of\nallowances are	permissible under  the statute except to the\nextent limited	by clauses  (d) and  (e) of  the proviso  to\nSection 10(2)  (xiv) of	 the  1922  Act	 and  reproduced  in\nclauses (iv) and (v) of	 Section 35(2) of the 1961 Act.\n     Before us	it is claimed on behalf of the assessee that\nthis interpretation  of the  statutory	provisions  is	very\nclear, patent  and unambiguous.	 It is	alleged that despite\nthis, some Income-tax Officers started disallowing the claim\nof depreciation	 in respect  of such  capital assets even in\nprevious years	during which  no deduction  was	 claimed  or\nallowed under Section 10(2) (xiv) or Section 35(2), contrary\nto the	clear language	of clause  (d) of  s.10(2) (xiv) and\ns.35(2) (iv). These Of orders were reversed on appeal either\nby the	Appellate Commissioner	or by  the Tribunal.  It was\nsuggested that	these decisions	 were almost  unanimously in\nfavour of  the assessee	 but the   department  persisted  in\npursuing the  matter upto  the stage of the High Court. Only\none reference  on this	topic came up before the High Courts\nand is	reflected in  the decision  of	the  Karnataka	High\nCourt, reported	 as CIT v. Indian Telephone Industries Ltd.,\n(1980) 126 I.T.R. 528. This was a reference of the year 1977\nmade at	 the instance  of the Commissioner of Income Tax and\nthe Commissioner of Income Tax lost this reference. The High\n(Sourt	re-affirmed   the  position  contended	for  by	 the\nassessee as  the one and only possible interpretation of the\nstatutory provisions. It is, therefore, contended that there\nwas, and  could have  been, no	doubt that  an assessee	 was\nentitled to  claim depreciation allowance in respect of such\nassets in  respect of  previous years  other than  those  in\nwhich an  allowance   had been allowed under the other head.\nWe shall revert later to this aspect of the matter.\n     At this stage, the Finance (No.2) Act, 1980 intervened.\nIt amended section 35(2) (iv) to read as follows:\n     \"(iv) where  a deduction is allowed\n     for any  previous year  under  this\n     section in	 respect of  expenditure\n     represented wholly	 or partly by an\n     asset,  no	  deduction   shall   be\n     allowed   under clauses  (i),  (ii)\n     and (iii)	of  sub-section	 (1)  of\n     section 32	 for  the  same	 or  any\n     other previous  year in  respect of\n     that asset.\"\n		      (Emphasis added)\n     The  Finance  Act	made  this  amendment  retrospective\nw.e.f. 1.4.62,	that is, the date of the commencement of the\n1961 Act.  This amendment is undoubtedly far-reaching in its\neffect.	 It   will  result  in	completion  of	the  pending\nassessments of	several years  on the  footing	of  the	 new\nprovision. It  will also involve re-opening or rectification\nof completed  assessments of  earlier years,  to the  extent\npermissible under the provisions of sections 148 and 154, in\ncases where  assessees had  been granted  \"double allowance\"\naccepting their	 contention at	the  time  of  the  original\nassessments. The  effect will be not for one assessment year\nbut for a number of assessment years in succession. Painting\na very	grim picture  of the  consequences  of	giving	full\nretrospective effect  to the  amendment, the  assessees	 say\nthat it will impose unexpected and impossible burden on them\nover the  years. jeopardise their solvency and lay them open\nto action  by creditor	and financial  institutions. Such an\nonerous burden, it is said. is unreasonable\nand  oppressive	 and  the  provision  imposing	such  burden\nviolates the  fundamental  rights  of  the  assessees  under\nArticles 14  and 19(1)	(g) of the Constitution of India. It\nis on  this plea  that, even  though assessments and appeals\nare pending in several of these cases, the petitioners chose\nto approach  this Court	 by  way  of  writ  petitions  under\nArticle 32  of	the  Constitution.  These  are	mostly	writ\npetitions of the year 1981 and are now coming up for hearing\nafter a period of 10 years.\n     Learned counsel  for the  assessees do  not contest the\ncompetence  of	 the  legislature   to	enact  the  impugned\nprovision, nor	do they dispute the right of the legislature\nto give	 retrospective effect  to statutory  provisions. The\ncontention only	 is that  retrospective	 provisions  may  be\npermissible   even in  taxing statutes	in  certain  special\ncircumstances such  as in  the case of provisions clarifying\nthe  impact   of  a  statute,  provisions  curing  defective\nlegislations in	 the light of the judicial decisions and the\nlike. They,  however, say that if the legislature chooses to\nimpose a  totally new  burden,	which  was  not	 at  all  in\ncontemplation	earlier	   and	 proceeds   to	 give	full\nretrospective effect  thereto, such  an	 attempt  should  be\nstruck	down   as    unreasonable  and	discriminatory.	 The\nprincipal questions, therefore, for our consideration are:\n     1)	 Were	the  earlier   statutory\n     provisions capable	 of  only    one\n     interpretation, namely, that placed\n     by the  assessees or  was there any\n     ambiguity in relation thereto ?\n     (2) If  there  was	 some  doubt  or\n     ambiguity	 about	  the	 earlier\n     legislation,  and	 the  1980   Act\n     clarified	 the   position	  by   a\n     retrospective amendment,  would  it\n     offend  the   provisions	of   the\n     Constitution ?\n     (3) If,  on  the  other  hand,  the\n     earlier provision	was  very  clear\n     and    capable    of    only    one\n     interpretation, as	 placed	 by  the\n     assessee,	 was   the   legislature\n     within its	 rights in  amending the\n     provision	retrospectively	  w.e.f.\n     1.4.62   and   thus   imposing   an\n     unreasonable  tax	 burden	 on  the\n     assessees?\n     Taking up	the first  of the three questions, it has to\nbe considered  from two	 angles, one  factual and the other,\nlegal. An  attempt was	made on behalf of the petitioners to\nproject an  image as  if the  interpretation  sought  to  be\nplaced by  the department on pre-1980 provisions to disallow\ndepreciation on such assets was so far-fetched that it never\nreceived the  approval of  the higher appellate authorities.\nIt was	suggested that	the appeals by assessees against the\ndisallowance invariably	 succeeded and it was the Department\nthat had  to move  the High Court on reference, the first of\nwhich references came up before the Karnataka High Court in\nC.l.T. v.  Indian Telephone  Industries	 (1980)	 126  I.T.R.\n548 and was answered against the Department. On the basis of\nsuch allegations  the petitioners attempted to make out that\nthe Department&apos;s  interpretation was  patently untenable and\nthat the  1980 amendment is not in the nature of a statutory\nclarification of  an ambiguity	but a  totally new and fresh\nimposition sought  to be  unjustifiably given  retrospective\neffect.\n     But, as Shri B.B. Ahuja has pointed out on the basis of\nthe averments  of the  petitioner in one of the cases, viz.,\nW.P.1153/81, the  impression sought  to be  created  by	 the\npetitioners does  not accord  with the	correct	 facts.	 The\nposition in  the case  is available  only as it stood at the\ntime when  the writ  petition and the counter affidavit were\nfiled	and   subsequent   developments	  are	not   known.\nNevertheless, the  picture that	 emerges is  this.  In	that\ncase, the  Income-tax  Officer	(I.T.O.)  is  said  to	have\nallowed depreciation on assets used for scientific research,\nfor the	 assessment year  1969-70, though  this is denied by\nthe department.	 The claim  was perhaps	 disallowed  by	 the\nI.T.O. for the assessment year 1970-71, but it was allowed\nby the	Allahabad Bench of the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal\n(I.T.A.T.) by  its order  dated 30.8.76.  For the assessment\nyear 1971-72,  the I.T.O.  disallowed the  depreciation. The\nAppellate Assistant  Commissioner (A.A.C.)  allowed it.	 The\ndepartment appealed to the Delhi Bench of the I.T.A.T. which\naccepted the department&apos;s plea by its order dated 13.8.79\n placing  reliance on the decision of a Special Bench of the\nI.T.A.T. It  has been  stated that  the	 assessee  filed  an\napplication for	 reference  to	the  High  Court  which	 was\npending when the writ petition was filed. For the assessment\nyears 1972-73  to 1974-75,  the assessments are pending as a\nstay order  had been  obtained for  reasons  which  are	 not\nknown. For  the assessment  years 1975-76  and 1976-77,	 the\nassessee claimed  depreciation	on  a  number  of  items  of\nscientific research  assets. The I.T.O. \"allowed\" the claims\nsubject to  the rider  that \"there  is no  provision to give\ndeduction of  more than	 100% of  the expenditure  by way of\ndepreciation\". The  assessee  appealed	to  Commissioner  of\nIncome-tax (Appeals)  who disallowed the claim. For 1977-78,\nthe l.T.O. disallowed the claim and the C.l.T. dismissed the\nassessee&apos;s appeals. For assessment years 1978-79 to 1980-81,\nthe assessments	 are stated  to be  pending. The above facts\nare sufficient to show that, atleast after 1.4.1968, - there\nis no  information before  us as  to  the  position  between\n1.4.1946 and  31.3.1968 -  the Department  has been  putting\nforward its  objections on  the issue  and that the same was\nthe subject  matter  of	 controversy  at  various  appellate\nstages, some  decided in  favour of,  and some	against, the\nassessee. A Special Bench of the l.T.A.T. had indeed decided\nthe issue  against the	assessee. In  this background, it is\nnot correct  to say  that the position was crystal clear and\nthat, save  for a  few ITOs  who took  a biassed  view,	 the\nauthorities were  all agreed that the Department&apos;s stand was\nuntenable. Some	 of the	 reported decisions  also show	that\nthere was  a live  controversy and that references have been\nmade to	 the  High  Court  both	 at  the  instances  or	 the\nassessees [see	Alkali &amp;  Chemical Corporation of India Ltd.\nv. C.l.T. (1986) 161 I.T.R. 820 (Cal.), and C.I.T. v. Indian\nExplosives Ltd.,  (1992) 192  I.T.R. 144 (Cal.)], as well as\nat the instance of the Revenue [see, C.I.T. v. International\nInstruments P. Ltd., (1983) 144 I.T.R. 936 (Kar.); C.I.T. v.\nMahindra Sintered Products Ltd. (1986) 161 I.T.R. 692 (Bom.)\nand Warner  Hindustan Ltd.  v. CIT,  (1988) 171	 I.T.R.	 224\n(A.P.)]. The petitioner&apos;s contention that, under the\n pre-amended  provisions, depreciation	on such	 assets	 was\nrecognised  allround   as  clearly  allowable  is  therefore\nrejected. We  have dealt  with this  aspect only  to meet an\naspect that  was urged. What is really important is the true\nand correct  interpretation of	those provisions,  not	what\nsomeone thought	 of it	then and to this aspect we shall now\nturn.\n \n     The second	 aspect of  the First of the three questions\nposed  earlier	 for  our  consideration  is  the  legal  or\ninterpretational aspect	 of the	 provisions  as	 they  stood\nprior to  the 1980  Amendment. Under  the provisions  of the\nstatute as  they stood	earlier, could	the  assessees	have\nclaimed continued  grant of depreciation after the expiry of\nfive previous  years before the 1968 amendment and after the\nexpiry or  the first  year after  the 1968  amendment,	even\nthough the  entire cost of the capital asset in question had\nbeen allowed  to  be  written  off  completely	against	 the\nbusiness  profits  of  those  five  previous  years  or	 one\nprevious year  as the  case may	 be? We	 think the answer to\nthis question  must emphatically  be in the negative. In our\nview, it is impossible to conceive of the legislature having\nenvisaged  a   double  deduction  in  respect  of  the	same\nexpenditure, even  though it  is true  that the two heads of\ndeduction do  not  completely  overlap	and  there  is	some\ndifference in  the rationale  of the  two  deductions  under\nconsideration. On behalf of the assessees reliance is placed\non the	following circumstances to support a contention that\nthe statute  did not  intend one  deduction to	preclude the\nother :\n     (i) lt  is pointed	 out that  s.10(2) (xiv) of the 1922\nAct, was  inserted in  1946 consequent on the insertion of a\ncorresponding  provision   in  the   United  Kingdom.	That\nprovision, viz. s.20(4) of the U.K. Finance Act, 1944\n read thus :\n     (4) Where	a deduction  is	 allowed\n     for any  year under  this	 or  the\n     last preceding  section in	 respect\n     of expenditure   represented wholly\n     or	 partly	  by  any   assets,   no\n     deduction	 shall be  allowed under\n     any provisions  of	 the  Income-tax\n     Act other	than this  part of  this\n     Act in  respect of	 wear and  tear,\n     obsolescence,    depreciation    or\n     exceptional depreciation  of  these\n     assets for	 any year  of assessment\n     during any	 part of  which they are\n     used by  the person carrying on the\n     trade   for   scientific	research\n     related to the trade. \"\n	  (emphasis supplied)\n     The Indian provision, it is said, has made a deliberate\ndeparture from	the said  provision and	 limited the  bar of\ndepreciation only  to those  previous years  during which  a\ndeduction is allowed under S.10(2) (xiv);\n     (ii) When	the Income-tax	Bill,  1961  was  under	 the\nconsideration of  the  Law  Commission,	 the  provisions  of\nS.10(2) (vi)  and (xiv) were carefully reviewed. But changes\nwere made  and the  provisions of the new Act in this regard\nwere drafted in pari materia with those of the old Act ;\n     (iii) The language used in clause (d) of the proviso to\nS.10(2)	 (xiv)	and  S.35(2)  (iv)  again  is  significantly\ndifferent from the language used in various other provisions\nof the	Act which,  in	like  contexts	of  possible  double\nallowances, emphatically  rule out  deductions in respect of\nthe same expense or exemptions in respect of the same income\nunder two  different provisions	 for the  same or  even	 any\nother assessment  year :  See, for  example, Sections  20(2)\n35B(2), 35C(2), 35CC(4), 35CCA(3), 35CCB(3), 35D(b), 35E(8),\n80GGA(4), 80HH(9A), 80HHA(7) and 80HHB(S); and\n     (iv) When the relevant provisions say that depreciation\nshall not be allowed in certain previous years, it permits a\ndisallowance only  in those  previous years  and  means,    The seeds of the present controversy were sown as early as in 1946. It is unfortunate that this matter should be coming up before this Court for its consideration nearly five decades later, though it must be pointed out that the issue in its present form is the outcome of an amendment made by the Finance (No.2) Act, 1980 (hereinafter referred to as \'the 1980 Act\') to the Income Tax Act, 1961* (hereinafter referred to as \'the 1961 Act\'). It is also a curious co-incidence that the 1980 Act effected two amendments in the 1961 Act with retrospective effect and the validity of both these provisions have been challenged before the courts. The first was the controversy with regard to the retrospective amendment of s.80-J which was settled by this Court by its decision in Lohia Machines Limited v. Union of India, (1985) 152 I.T.R. 308 (SC). It is the second amendment to the provisions contained in section 35(2) of the 1961 Act that has given rise to the present controversy between the parties.\r\n\r\nheld: So far as the arguments of taking away of vested rights is concerned, it is evident from the facts stated in the writ petition 1153/81 - which was treated as representative of the facts and contentions in all the writ petitions and with reference to which facts were arguments addressed itself that none of the assessments relating to any of the assessment years concerned herein has become final. They are pending at one or the other stage and in one or the other forum. I need not dilate upon this aspect inasmuch as the impugned amendment merely makes explicit what was implicit in the unamended clause, as explained hereinabove. In such a situation, the argument of any right vesting in the assessees is misplaced.\r\n\r\nThe writ petitions accordingly fail and are dismissed. No costs.\r\n\r\nPetitions  was dismissed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ','Sachalmal Parasram Vs Ratnabai And Ors. JUDGMENT S.M. Sikri, C.J.\r\n\r\n1. This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh dismissing the appeal filed by the appellant before us. The relevant facts for the determination of the points raised before us are as follows :\r\n\r\n2. Respondents Nos. 1, 2 and 3, who were the owners of the premises in dispute, mortgaged the premises in favour of respondent No. 4, with possession. Vide two mortgage deeds dated December 5, 1947 and October 26, 1948, for the amounts of 12,000/-and Rs. 4,000/- respectively. The date of payment was October 8, 1952, but by a subsequent agreement dated November 18, 1952, this was extended. The agreement further provided as follows :\r\n\r\nThe portion of the house in your side shall remain with you at a rental of Rs. 50/- per month. It was with you previously at Rs. 43/- per month. We shall not be responsible for any decrease or increase in the rental thereof. You shall have the right to let out the half portion of the shop on your side to any person at full rent\r\n\r\nOn May 1, 1958 respondent No. 4, the mortgagee in possession, filed a suit for foreclosure. During the pendency of this suit he let out the premises to the appellant at Rs. 55/- per month. It was provided in the rent agreement between the mortgagee and the appellant that &quot;incase the owner of the house gets the house released from mortgage under us, then I shall get the house vacated for you and hand it over to you.&quot; On September 28, 1960, a compromised decree for redemption was passed. The mortgagors, in execution of the said compromise decree, sought to take possession of the premises in dispute, which had been rented to the appellant. The appellant&#39;s objections under Order 21 Rule 97, CPC, were ultimately disallowed by the High Court, in revision, on April 18, 1964. The appellant then filed the present suit under Order 21, Rule 103, CPC for a declaration that &quot;the plaintiff (appellant) being the tenant of defendants Nos. 1, 2 and 3 (respondents) cannot be evicted unless eviction proceedings are taken against him under M.P. Premises Control Act.&quot; In the alternative, the appellant prayed for a declaration that &quot;if the plaintiff is considered to be the tenant of deft No. 4 even after the redemption decree the plaintiff cannot be evicted. He also prayed for a consequential permanent injunction. The Trial Court dismissed the suit. An appeal before the Additional District Judge also failed. As already mentioned, the second appeal before the High Court also failed.\r\n\r\n3. The learned Counsel for the appellant submitted that respondent No. 4, being the mortgagee in possession, had the right to let the premises in dispute both under Section 76 of the Transfer of Property Act, and under the agreement dated November 18, 1952. According to him, this act was an act prudent management and was binding on the respondents Nos. 1, 2 and 3. He further contended that he was protected by the provisions of the Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Control Act, 1961, and could not be evicted except in accordance with the provisions of that Act.\r\n\r\n4. The points raised by Mr. Naunit Lal are concluded by the decision of this Court in All India Film Corporation Ltd. v. Sri Rajagyan Nath : , which decision was unfortunately not brought to our notice during the course of the hearing. In this case the facts were similar. A mortgagee in possession had let out the premises, which was a cinema house, and the lessee had further sublet the same, to sub-les Sections On redemption the purchaser\r\n Property - Mortgage - Section 76(a) of Transfer of Property Act, 1882 - High Court expelled Appeal documented by Appellant for assertion that Plaintiff being an occupant can not be removed unless ousting procedures are taken against him and furthermore petitioned God for significant lasting directive - Hence, this Appeal - Whether, demonstration of rent was not demonstration of judicious administration - Held, long rent on such little lease was not demonstration of reasonability - However, Section 76(a) of Act expressed that demonstrations done genuine and wisely in common course of administration bound even after end of title of mortgagee under lock and key - Moreover, lease deed itself stipulated that renter would empty house and hand over same to Respondent on the off chance that proprietor of House got house discharged from home loan - There was no landowner and no inhabitant - Therefore arrangements of Rent Restriction Act couldn&#39;t matter - Appeal rejected.\r\n Disposed off','Hira Lal Rattan Lal Etc.

They  raise\ncommon questions of law for decision, and they are  directed\nagainst a common judgment of the Allahabad High Court.\nThe  facts  of the case lie within a  narrow  compass.	 The\nappellants  are dealers in foodgrains including cereals	 and\npulses	especially  split or processed foodgrains  and	dal.\nThe dispute in this case centers round the question  whether\nthe  Government	 is  competent	to  levy  sales-tax  on	 the\npurchases   made  by  the  appellants  of  split   processed\nfoodgrains  and	 dal  under the	 provisions  of	 the  United\nProvinces  Sales  Tax  Act, 1948 as  amended  by  the  Uttar\nPradesh	 Sales Tax Act (Amendment and Validation) Act,	1970\n(which will hereinafter be referred to as the Act).\nUnder  the Sales Tax Act as it originally stood	 which	will\n-hereinafter  be  referred  to as the  principal  Act),	 the\npurchases  of  split  or processed  foodgrains	and  dal  by\ndealers	 were sought, to be brought to tax under s.  3-D  of\nthe  principal Act read with the notification  issued.	 The\nvalidity  of the levy was challenged by Tilock Chand  Prasan\nKumar,	the appellant in Civil Appeal NO&apos;. 1625 of  1971  in\nrespect	 of  the assessment made on him for  the  assessment\nyear  1966-67  by assessment order dated June  30,  1968  by\nmeans of a writ petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution.\nThe  High  Court of Allahabad struck down the  levy  holding\nthat the dal purchased by the petitioner before it could not\nbe  said  to be a commodity essentially different  from	 the\narhar  dal  purchased by the dal mills and  accordingly	 the\npurchases effected by the petitioner could not be  regarded\nas  the first purchases.  This decision is reported  in	 25,\nS.T.C.	p. 118.	 Thereafter the Governor of U.P.  issued  an\nordinance  known as Uttar Pradesh Sales Tax  (Amendment	 and\nValidation) Ordinance, 1970 (U.P. Ordinance\n \nNo. 2 of 1970) adding inter alia Explanation 11 to s. 3-D as\nwell as s. 7 to the principal Act.  This ordinance was later\non  enacted  as	 an  Act  to  which  we	 have  already	made\nreference.  The provisions of the Amending Act are identical\nwith the provisions in the Ordinance.  Though at the time of\nthe  institution  of  the writ petitions  from	which  these\nappeals arise, the Ordinance had not yet been made into	 the\nAct, the Amending Act came into force during the pendency of\nthe writ petitions.  Hence we shall refer to the  provisions\nof the Amending Act.\n	      Under the principal Act a dealer is defined in\n	      s.  2(c)	as \" \"dealer\" means  any  person  or\n	      association   of	persons	 carrying   on	 the\n	      business	of buying or selling goods in  Uttar\n	      Pradesh, whether for commission,	remuneration\n	      or  otherwise, and includes any firm or  Hindu\n	      Joint   Family  and  any	society,   club	  or\n	      association  which sells goods to its  members\n	      and also includes any department of the  State\n	      Government  or  the Central  Government  which\n	      carries  on such business and any	 undertaking\n	      engaged  in the generation or distribution  of\n	      electrical energy or any other form of power.\"\n	      (Explanation  to the section is  not  relevant\n	      for our present purpose).\n	      Section 3 of the Act provides for the levy  of\n	      multi-point tax.	The portion of that  section\n	      which  is	 material for  our  present  purpose\n	      reads :\n	      \"Subject to the provisions of this Act,  every\n	      dealer shall, for each assessment year, pay a\n	      lax at the rate of two naye paise per rupee on\n	      his  turnover  of such year,  which  shall  be\n	      determined   in	such  manner   as   may	  be\n	      prescribed\"\n	      Section  3-A  provides  for  a  single   point\n	      taxation in respect of sale of certain  goods.\n	      At  present we are only concerned with  s.  3-\n	      D(1).  It provides :\n	      \"Except as provided in sub-section (2),  there\n	      shall be levied and paid, for each  assessment\n	      year  or part thereof, a tax on the  turnover,\n	      to  be  determined in such manner	 as  may  be\n	      prescribed,  of  first  purchases	 made  by  a\n	      dealer  or  through  a  dealer,  acting  as  a\n	      purchasing  agent in respect of such goods  or\n	      class  of	 goods,	 and  at  such	rates,	 not\n	      exceeding	 two paise per rupee in the case  of\n	      foodgrains, including cereals and pulses,	 and\n	      five  paise  per rupee in the  case  of  other\n	      goods and with effect from such date, as	may,\n	      from  time to time, be notified by the,  State\n	      Government in this behalf.\"\n	      (Explanation 1 to this section is not relevant\n	      for our purpose).\n \nThe notification issued under s. 3-D of the principal Act on\nOctober	 1,  1964 (Notification No. S. T.  7122/X)  provided\nthat  with  effect  from October 1, 1964,  the	turnover  of\npurchases  in  respect of goods mentioned therein  shall  be\nliable to tax under s. 3-D at the rate mentioned:\n\"Foodgrains    1.5 paise per rupee on first purchase\nOn  the	 basis	of s. 3-D read	with  the  notification,  as\nmentioned  earlier, the authorities under the Act sought  to\nbring to tax under the principal Act the first purchases  of\nprocessed  or split foodgrains including dal on	 the  ground\nthat  they constituted a separate item of  foodgrains  quite\nindependent  of the unprocessed or unsplit foodgains.	This\nview, as seen above, was negatived by the High Court.  After\nthe  decision  of  the High Court,  the	 principal  Act	 was\namended.   Under  the.	Amending Act  one  more	 Explanation\nviz., Explanation 11 was added to s. 3-D.\n	      \"For  the purposes of this sub-section,  split\n	      or  processed foodgrains, such as in the	form\n	      of  dal shall be deemed to be  different	from\n	      unsplit	or   unprocessed   foodgrains,	 and\n	      accordingly, nothing in this sub-section shall\n	      be  construed to prevent the imposition,	levy\n	      or  collection  of the tax in respect  of	 the\n	      first   purchases	  of  split   or   processed\n	      foodgrains  merely because. tax had  been	 im-\n	      posed  levied or collected earlier in  respect\n	      of the first purchases of those foodgrains  in\n	      their unsplit or unprocessed form.\"\n	      The  Amending  Act  also	added  a  validating\n	      provision to the principal Act viz. s. 7. That\n	      section reads :\n	      \"Notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order\n	      of  any  court or tribunal  to  the  contrary,\n	      every  notification  issued or  purporting  to\n	      have been issued under Section 3-A or  Section\n	      3-D  of  the  principal Act  before  the	com-\n	      mencement of this Act shall be deemed to	have\n	      been  issued under that section as amended  by\n	      this  Act and shall be so interpreted  and  be\n	      deemed to be and always to have been as  valid\n	      as if the provisions of this Act were in force\n	      at   all	material  times;   and	 accordingly\n	      anything	done or any action taken  (including\n	      any order made, proceeding taken, jurisdiction\n	      exercised,  assessment  made, or	tax  levied,\n	      collected or paid purporting to have been done\n	      or   taken   in	pursuance   of	 any	such\n	      notification)  shall  be	deemed	to  be,	 and\n	      always to have been, validly and lawfully done\n	      or taken.\"\n	      It will be necessary later on to consider what\n	      was the vice that the legislature intended  to\n	      cure by the Amending Act.	 The\n	      --L498Sup Cl/73\n \n	      sequence	 of  events  itself  discloses	 the\n	      purpose  of  the	Ordinance  as  well  as	 the\n	      Amending	Act.  That apart, the  statement  of\n	      objects  and  reasons which  can	be  usefully\n	      looked  into  for the purpose of	finding	 the\n	      vice  that  the  legislature  was	 trying	  to\n	      provide against reads thus\n	      \"Sections	 3-A and 3-D of the U.P.  Sales	 Tax\n	      Act,  1948 provide for single point  taxation.\n	      Under the fondler section the tax is levied on\n	      the turnover of sales, while under the  latter\n	      the  tax	is levied on the turnover  of  first\n	      purchases.  Plain and ornamented glass bangles\n	      are subject to tax separately under section 3-\n	      A.   Similarly, unsplit and split	 pulses	 are\n	      separately  subject to tax under section	3-D.\n	      It has been held by the High Court in one case\n	      that tax cannot be levied separately on  plain\n	      and ornamented glass bangles under section 3-A\n	      and  in  another	that tax  cannot  be  levied\n	      separately  on unsplit and split pulses  under\n	      section  3-D  because in their  opinion  plain\n	      glass  bangles are not a	commodity  different\n	      from  ornamented glass bangles  and  similarly\n	      unsplit  pulses and split pulses are also	 not\n	      two  different commodities.   These  judgments\n	      have   created  legal  difficulties   in	 the\n	      assessment  and  collection  of  tax  on	 the\n	      aforesaid	 commodities.  Besides, the  dealers\n	      have  started applying for the refund  of	 tax\n	      already collected on these commodities.	Ibis\n	      will have serious repercussions on the State&apos;s\n	      revenue.	Accordingly, it is proposed to amend\n	      sections	3-A and 3-D to provide for the	levy\n	      of   tax	on  the	 aforesaid  commodities	  as\n	      separate	items.	 It  is	 also  proposed	  to\n	      validate	 the  past  levy,   assessment	 and\n	      collection of tax on the above commodities.\"\n	      (The  remaining  part  of	 the  statement	  of\n	      objects  and reasons is not relevant  for	 our\n	      present purpose).\n	      The  appellants  challenged  the	validity  of\n	      Explanation  11  of  S. 3-D as well  as  s.  7\n	      introduced by the Amending Act before the High\n	      Court of Allahabad in petitions under Art. 226\n	      of  the Constitution.  They further  took	 the\n	      plea that the amendments incorporated were not\n	      effective	 enough	 to bring to tax  the  first\n	      purchases of split or processed foodgrains and\n	      pulses.	 The  High  Court   rejected   these\n	      contentions and dismissed the writ  petitions.\n	      Thereafter  these	 appeals have  been  brought\n	      after  obtaining	certificates from  the	High\n	      Court.\n	      The  validity  of	 the levy  in  question	 was\n	      challenged on the following grounds&apos;:\n	      (1)   That  no fresh levy can be imposed by  a\n	      retrospective legislation;\n \n	      (2)   That  the legislature cannot in case  of\n	      legislation  of the nature with which  we	 are\n	      concerned,    separate	into	 independent\n	      commodities   split  and	unsplit	 pulses	  or\n	      processed	 or unprocessed pulses and  on	that\n	      footing  seek to impose tax twice over on	 the\n	      same commodity in respect of the goods  liable\n	      to be taxed at a single point;\n	      (3)   That  the newly added Explanation to  s.\n	      3-D read with s. 7 of the Amending Act amounts\n	      to an unlawful usurpation of judicial power by\n	      the legislature;\n	      (4)   The newly added Explanation II to s. 3-D\n	      is violative of Art. 14 of the  Constitution\n	      There  is	 no rational  basis  for  separating\n	      split  or	 processed pulses  from	 unsplit  or\n	      unprocessed pulses;\n	      (5)   On a true construction of Explanation It\n	      to s. 3-D no fresh charge can be held to	have\n	      been imposed,\n	      (6)   No	levy  of purchase tax  can  be	made\n	      without a fresh Notification under s. 3-D read\n	      with Explanation 11 showing therein separately\n	      foodgrains  unsplit or unprocessed as well  as\n	      foodgrains split or processed; and\n	      (7)   That   the	 power	conferred   on	 the\n	      Government   under  s.  3-D  amounts   to	  an\n	      excessive delegation of legislative power. and\n	      consequently void.\nThe  source  of	 the  legislative power	 to  levy  sales  or\npurchase  tax  on goods is Entry 54 of the List	 II  of	 the\nConstitution.	 It   is  well	settled	 that	subject	  to\nconstitutional restrictions a power to legislate includes  a\npower to legislate prospectively as well as retrospectively.\nIn this regard legislative power to impose tax also includes\nwithin	itself	the power to  tax  retrospectively--see	 The\nUnion of India v. Madan Gopal Kabra;(1) M. P.  Sundararamier\n&amp;  Co. v. The State of Andhra Pradesh and Anr. (2) ;  J.  K.\nJute Mills Co. Ltd. v. The State of Uttar Pradesh and  Anr.;\n(3) Chhotabhai Jethabhai Patel and Co. v. The Union of India\nand Anr. (4 Sri Ramkrishna &amp; Ors. v. The State of Bihar. (5)\nIn the last mentioned case it was specifically decided	that\nwhere  the legislature can make a valid law, it can  provide\nnot  only  for	the prospective operation  of  the  material\nprovisions  of the said law but it can also provide for	 the\nretrospective operation of the said provisions.\nWe see no force in the second contention advanced on  behalf\nof  the	 appellants.  As seen earlier the  general  rule  as\nenunciated in s. 3 is multi point tax sales tax or  purchase\ntax; but power\n(1) [1954] S. C. R. 541.\n(2)  [1958] S. C. R. 1422.\n(3)  12. S.T.C. 429.\n(4)  [1962] Supp, (2) S.C.R. p. 1.\n(5) [1964] 1 S.C.R. 897.\n \nis conferred on the Government to select any transaction  in\nrespect	 of such goods or class of goods as  the  Government\nmay choose to levy a single point sales tax or purchase tax.\nIt  is open to the legislature to define the nature  of	 the\ngoods,	the sale or purchase of which should be	 brought  to\ntax.   Legislature  was	 not  incompetent  to  separate	 the\nprocessed  or split pulses from the unsplit  or	 unprocessed\npulses and treat the two as separate and independent goods.\nIn  Jagannath and Ors. v. Union of India,(1) question  arose\nfor  decision  whether	it was open to	the  legislature  to\nimpose	separate excise duty on tobacco leaf as well  as  on\nbroken leaf of tobacco.	 This Court overruled the contention\nthat  such a levy was invalid. It head that it was open	 for\nthe legislature to separate the two items.  We see no  basis\nfor  the  contention  that the legislature  cannot  for	 the\npurpose of tax under the Act separate the split or processed\nPulses	from the unsplit or unprocessed.  The power  of	 the\nlegislature  to specify the nature of the goods the sale  or\npurchase of which, it will bring to tax is very wide.\nNow coming to point No. 3, there is no justification for the\ncontention  that  the legislature has usurped  any  judicial\npower.	The legislature has not purported either directly or\nby  necessary implication to overrule the decisions  of	 the\nAllahabad  High.  Court in Tilok Chand Prasan  Kumar&apos;s	case\n(supra).

The contest  before  us  is\nconfined  to the quantum of compensation and, although	Shri\nVasudeva Pillai, counsel for the appellants&apos; has pressed his\npoints	with persistence, we are unable to disturb the	High\nCourt&apos;s award.\nThe land, vast in extent, had a building with a plinth	area\nof  3,300 sq. yds.  The area in which the acquired  plot  is\nsituate	 is  perhaps an important one in  the  City.   After\ngetting	 expert	 valuation  made of  the  buildings  by	 the\nCentral	 Public	 Works Department engineers,  the  Collector\nawarded a sum of Rs. 41,674/- for the buildings, Rs. 1,440/-\nfor the standing trees and a sum of Rs. 30,630/for a belt of\nland  50  ft.  deep  at Rs. 15/- per  square  yard  and	 Rs.\n99,435/-  for  the remaining area of 13,258 sq.	 yds.	The,\ntotal figure together with statutory solarium granted by the\nCollector was Rs. 1,99,155.85. This figure fell far short of\nthe ambitious claim of the appellant and, when the case came\nbefore	the  City Civil Court on a reference, there  was  an\nenhancement   of   compensation.    Although   the   learned\nAdditional Chief Judge held that the area was a little	less\nthan had been determined by the Collector, the market  value\nof the building was increased nearly four fold on the  basis\nof  a multiple of 25 times the rent fetched.  On  the  other\nitems also some changes were made and, consequentially,	 the\ntotal  amount was raised to Rs. 3,31,092/-.   The  appellant\narrived	 in  the High Court asking for more (and  the  State\nalso appears to have appealed, but its appeal was  dismissed\nand we are not therefore concerned with it).\nSome  measure of good fortune attended the appeal since	 the\nHigh Court altered the multiple from 25 to 27 in fixing	 the\ncompensation for the building.	Otherwise, it  substantially\naffirmed the findings of the trial Court, except that to the\nadvantage  of the appellant it restored the  area  acquired.\nThe net result was the appellant obtained a total sum of Rs.\n3,52,326.65 as compensation.\nIt is thus clear that from the Collector to the Civil  Court\nand  on, to the High Court. there has been an escalation  in\nthe  amount  of compensation and, hopefully, the  owner	 has\nreached	 this  Court with his appeal,  under  a	 certificate\nwhich  he  secured under Art. 133(1)(a)	 before	 the  recent\namendment.  We mention this because we are unable to discern\nany  substantial  question of law of general  importance  in\ncounsel&apos;s   submissions	 or  the  points  outlined  in	 the\nmemorandum of appeal which merits the consideration of	this\nCourt.\n \nMerely	because the claim is large the judgment need not  be\nlong  :and,  although  the appellant tried  to	spread	the,\ncanvas	 wide,	 we   regard   the   points   deserving	  of\nconsideration-as  falling  within  a  narrow  compass.	 The\nburden	of  the song has been that Hyderabad has,  for	his-\ntorical	 reasons,  become  a great city and  that  the	land\nacquired has precious potential value which has not  entered\nthe  judicial computation at the lesser levels. (By  way  of\naside  one, may say that society economic development  of  a\nCity-  may  enhance  the  value of  space  without  any	 the\nlittlest contribution by its owner and it is, in one  sense,\nunfair	that  society should pay to an individual  a  higher\nprice  not  because he has-earned it but  because  of  other\ndevelopmental factors.	Of course, we are concerned with the\nLand  Acquisition  Act as it is and this  thought  therefore\nneed not be pursued).  Counsel has also urged that the	land\nand the building taken together had a personality of its own\nand  therefore a special value, missed by the courts  below,\nshould	be ascribed and the methodology of breaking  up	 the\ntotality  into	buildings  and	lands  separately  This appeal, by certificate, arises out of land acquisition proceedings under the Hyderabad Land Acquisition Act (Hyderabad Act IX of 1309 Fasli) (hereinafter called the Act, for short) which substantially resembles the provisions of the Central Land Acquisition Act. The Government of Andhra Pradesh acquired a large open area with some buildings thereon by Notification, dated January 3, 1957 with a view to construct Income-tax add Central Excise Offices at Hyderabad. The contest before us is confined to the quantum of compensation and, although Shri Vasudeva Pillai, counsel for the appellants\' has pressed his points with persistence, we are unable to disturb the High Court\'s award. The land, vast in extent, had a building with a plinth area of 3,300 sq. yds. The area in which the acquired plot is situate is perhaps an important one in the City. After getting expert valuation made of the buildings by the Central Public Works Department engineers, the Collector awarded a sum of Rs. 41,674/- for the buildings, Rs. 1,440/- for the standing trees and a sum of Rs. 30,630/for a belt of land 50 ft. deep at Rs. 15/- per square yard and Rs. 99,435/- for the remaining area of 13,258 sq. yds. The, total figure together with statutory solarium granted by the Collector was Rs. 1,99,155.85. This figure fell far short of the ambitious claim of the appellant and, when the case came before the City Civil Court on a reference, there was an enhancement of compensation. Although the learned Additional Chief Judge held that the area was a little less than had been determined by the Collector, the market value of the building was increased nearly four fold on the basis of a multiple of 25 times the rent fetched. On the other items also some changes were made and, consequentially, the total amount was raised to Rs. 3,31,092/-. The appellant arrived in the High Court asking for more (and the State also appears to have appealed, but its appeal was dismissed and we are not therefore concerned with it). Some measure of good fortune attended the appeal since the High Court altered the multiple from 25 to 27 in fixing the compensation for the building. Otherwise, it substantially affirmed the findings of the trial Court, except that to the advantage of the appellant it restored the area acquired. The net result was the appellant obtained a total sum of Rs. 3,52,326.65 as compensation. It is thus clear that from the Collector to the Civil Court and on, to the High Court. there has been an escalation in the amount of compensation and, hopefully, the owner has reached this Court with his appeal, under a certificate which he secured under Art. 133(1)(a) before the recent amendment. Court mention this because court is unable to discern any substantial question of law of general importance in counsel\'s submissions or the points outlined in the memorandum of appeal which merits the consideration of this Court.\r\n\r\nHeld: Court is satisfied with the valuation of the rented portion of the house adopted by the High Court is correct. Shri Pillai argued in vain for an augmentation of the value on the potential user of the plot for a Cinema House. This story has been factually disbelieved by the Courts below and we cannot reopen the matter. Court must also remember that the Court below has been indulgent enough to adopt a multiple of 27 despite the fact that the buildings acquired are over 30 years old. Nor does it come with grace from the appellant to contend against the belting method since he himself had asked for its application before the Collector and the trial Court.\r\n\r\nCourt is thus satisfied that there is no law, no fact, which comes to the rescue of the appellant and his appeal, virtually against concurrent findings of fact, therefore deserves to be, and is hereby, dismissed with costs. ','Daya Singh Lahoria Vs Union Of India And Ors With\nSpecial Leave Petition (Crl.) Nos. 2697-2698  of 2000.\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nPATTANAIK,J.\nLITTTTTTTJ\n\n    The Writ Petition and the Special Leave Petitions raised\nthe common question, and as such were heard together and are\ndisposed  of by this common judgment.  The grievance of	 the\npetitioner Daya Singh Lahoria, in the Writ Petition is, that\nthe  Criminal Courts in the country have no jurisdiction  to\ntry  in respect of offences which do not form a part of	 the\nextradition  judgment by virtue of which the petitioner	 has\nbeen  brought  to this country and he can be tried only	 for\nthe  offences  mentioned  in the  Extradition  Decree.	 The\npetitioner  has	 also  prayed for quashing of  the  FIR	 and\ncharge	sheet  against	him which are not  included  in	 the\nextradition judgment of the USA Court.	It appears, that the\nUnited	States District of Texas Fort Worth Division  issued\nthe  judgment  of certification of extraditability  and	 the\nsaid  decree  certifies to sustain under Extradition  Treaty\nbetween	 the  United  States  and  the	United	Kingdom	 and\nNorthern  Ireland  with the Government of Republic of  India\nand  specifies the offences for which the accused, mentioned\nin  the	 extradition  order  could  be	tried.	 It  is	 the\ncontention of the petitioner that he cannot be tried for the\noffences   other   than	 the   offences	 mentioned  in	 the\nextradition  order  as	that  would be	a  contravention  of\nSection	  21  of  the  Extradition   Act  as  well  as	 the\ncontravention of the provisions of the International Law and\nthe very Charter of Extradition Treaty.\n\n    The	 Special Leave Applications are directed against the\norder of Rajasthan High Court wherein the High Court refused\nto  entertain  a  Habeas  Corpus  Petition  and	 decide	 the\nquestion  as  to  the jurisdiction of the  Designated  Court\nunder  the  provisions	of   the  Terrorist  and  Disruptive\nActivities  (Prevention)  Act, 1987, on the ground  that  an\nobjection  to  the  said jurisdiction could  be	 made  under\nSection	 18 of the Act before the very Designated Court	 and\nan application for issuance of a Writ of Habeas Corpus would\nnot lie.  The question for consideration in the said Special\nLeave  Petitions,  therefore, is whether an accused, who  is\nbeing  tried  in respect of offences under  the	 Extradition\nTreaty	can  be tried for any other offence which  does	 not\nform  a part of the decree in view of the specific provision\ncontained in Section 21 of the Extradition Act, 1962.\n\n    To	consolidate  and  amend	 the  law  relating  to	 the\nextradition of fugitive criminals and to provide for matters\nconnected  therewith, or incidental thereto, the Extradition\nAct of 1962 has been enacted.  Prior to the enactment of the\naforesaid  law of extradition applicable to India was  found\nscattered in the United Kingdom Extradition Act of 1870, the\nFugitive Offenders Act, 1881 and the Indian Extradition Act,\n1903.	The expression extradition means, surrender by one\nState  to  another of a person desired to be dealt with	 for\ncrimes	 of  which  he	has   been  accused  and  which	 are\njusticiable  in the Courts of the other States.	 The  rights\nof  a  citizen	not to be sent out to  foreign	jurisdiction\nwithout	 strict compliance with law relating to	 extradition\nis  a valuable right.  This Extradition Act is a special law\ndealing	 with criminals and accused of certain crimes and it\nprescribes the procedure for trial as well as the embargo in\ncertain contingencies.	The expression extradition offence\nhas  been  defined in Section 2 (c) of the Act to  mean,  in\nrelation  to  a	 foreign  State, being a  treaty  State,  an\noffence	 punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall\nnot  be	 less than one year under the laws of India or of  a\nforeign	 State	and  includes  a  composite  offence.	 The\nexpression  extradition Treaty has been defined in Section\n2(d)  to  mean, a treaty (agreement or arrangement) made  by\nIndia  with  a foreign State relating to the extradition  of\nfugitive  criminals and includes any treaty relating to	 the\nextradition  of fugitive criminals made before the 15th	 day\nof August, 1947, which extends to, and is binding on, India.\nThe  expression	 foreign State is defined in Section  2(e)\nincludes   any	State  outside	 India	and  includes  every\nconstituent  part,  colony  or	dependency  of	such  State.\nSection	 21  of	 the  Extradition Act is  relevant  for	 our\npurpose.\n\n    Section  21, as it stood in the Extradition Act of	1962\nis extracted hereinbelow in extenso:\n\n    Section 21:	 Accused or convicted person surrendered or\nreturned  by foreign State or Commonwealth country not to be\ntried  for previous offence:- Whenever any person accused or\nconvicted  of an offence, which if committed in India, would\nbe  an extradition offence, is surrendered or returned by  a\nforeign	 State	or Commonwealth country, that  person  shall\nnot, until he has been restored or has had an opportunity of\nreturning to that State or country, be tried in India for an\noffence	 committed  prior to the surrender or return,  other\nthan  the  extradition offence proved by the facts on  which\nthe surrender or return is based.\n\n    This  section  is  based  on Section 19  of	 the  United\nKingdom Extradition Act, 1870.	The original Act of 1962 was\namended	 by  Act  66  of  1993.	   Under  the  1962  Act,  a\ndistinction   had  been	  maintained  between	Commonwealth\ncountries  and	foreign States and the foreign	States	were\nconsidered   as	 treaty	 States.    The	  extradition	with\nCommonwealth  countries	 were  separately  governed  by	 the\nSecond	Schedule  of the Act and the Central Government	 was\ngiven	power	under  Chapter	 III  to  conclude   special\nextradition   arrangements  with   respect  to	Commonwealth\ncountries  only.   The amended Act of 1993 enables India  to\nconclude  extradition  treaty with foreign State,  including\nthe   Commonwealth   countries,	   without   treating	them\nstructurally  different.  It provides for  extra-territorial\njurisdiction  over  foreigners for crimes committed by	them\noutside	 India and it incorporates composite offences in the\ndefinition  of	extradition offence.  It excludes  political\noffences  as  a	 defence in cases of offences of  a  serious\nnature	and  it covers extradition requests on the basis  of\ninternational  convention.   It	 also  enables	the  Central\nGovernment  to	make  and receive requests  for	 provisional\narrest	of fugitives in urgent cases pending the receipt  of\nthe  formal extradition request.  Section 21 of 1962 Act was\nsubstituted by Act 66 of 1993, as follows:\n\n\n    Section 21	Accused or convicted person surrendered or\nreturned  by  foreign  State  not to be	 tried	for  certain\noffences.   - Whenever any person accused or convicted of an\noffence,   which,  if  committed  in   India  would  be	  an\nextradition offence, is surrendered or returned by a foreign\nState,	such person shall not, until he has been restored or\nhas  had an opportunity of returning to that State, be tried\nin India for an offence other than.\n\n    (a)	 the extradition offence in relation to which he was\nsurrendered or returned;  or\n\n    (b) any lesser offence disclosed by the facts proved for\nthe  purposes of securing his surrender or return other than\nan  offence in relation to which an order for his  surrender\nor return could not be lawfully made;  or\n\n    (c)	 the  offence in respect of which the foreign  State\nhas given its consent.\n\n    The	  provision   of  the	aforesaid   Section   places\nrestrictions  on  the trial of the person extradited and  it\noperates  as a bar to the trial of the fugitive criminal for\nany  other  offence  until the condition of  restoration  or\nopportunity  to return is satisfied.  Under the amended	 Act\nof 1993, therefore, a fugitive could be tried for any lesser\noffence,  disclosed  by	 the facts proved or  even  for	 the\noffence	 in respect of which the foreign State has given its\nconsent.   It thus, enables to try the fugitive for a lesser\noffence, without restoring him to the State or for any other\noffence, if the State concerned gives its consent.  In other\nwords,	it may be open for our authorities to obtain consent\nof  the	 foreign  State to try the fugitive  for  any  other\noffence	 for  which  the extradition decree might  not	have\nmentioned,  but	 without obtaining such consent, it  is	 not\npossible  to  try  for	any other offence,  other  than	 the\noffence	 for which the extradition decree has been obtained.\nThe  Extradition  Treaty contains several articles of  which\nArticle	 7 is rather significant for our purpose, which	 may\nbe quoted hereinbelow in extenso:-\n\n    Article 7.	A person surrendered can in no case be kept\nin  custody or be brought to trial in the territories of the\nHigh  Contracting Party to whom the surrender has been	made\nfor  any other crime or offence, or on account of any  other\nmatters,  than	those for which the extradition	 shall	have\ntaken  place,  until  he has been restored, or	has  had  an\nopportunity  of	 returning, to the territories of  the	High\nContracting Party by whom he has been surrendered.\n\n    This  stipulation  does n Removal Act, 1962 - Section 21 - an outlaw brought into this nation under an Extradition Decree can be attempted just for the offenses specified in the Extradition Decree and for no other offense and the Criminal Courts of this nation will have no purview to attempt such outlaw for whatever other offense. ','State Of T.N Vs Ananthi Ammal The Judgmenttt of the Court was delivered by S.P. BHARUCHA, J.-\r\n\r\nCivil Appeal No. 3312 of 1981\r\n\r\n1.This appeal by special leave is filed by the State of Tamil Nadu against the judgment and order of the High Court of Madras dated 9-9-1981, where by the Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for Harijan Welfare Schemes Act, 1978, was struck down as being ultra vires the Constitution of India. The High Court came to the conclusion that the said Act did not enjoy the protection of Articles 31-C or 31-A and that it was violative of Articles 14, 19 and 300-A of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n2.Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the said Act was not violative of Article 14 or Article 19 or Article 300-A and that, in any event, it was protected by reason of Article 31 A. Learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the said Act was violative of Article 14 inasmuch as it was enacted to acquire lands for a purpose which could as well be served by the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, and that a comparison of the provisions of the said Act with those of the Land Acquisition Act showed that the provisions of the said Act were far harsher insofar as the landowner was concerned. Learned counsel for the respondents also submitted that the said Act did not enjoy the protection conferred by Article 31-C notwithstanding the declaration in that behalf contained in Section 2 thereof.\r\n\r\n3.The said Act contains in Section 2 the declaration aforementioned, namely, that it is enacted to give effect to the policy of the State towards securing the principles laid down in Part IV and, in particular, Article 46 of the Constitution. It is enacted to provide for acquisition of land for Harijan Welfare Schemes.\r\n\r\n4.Section 3 of the said Act is the definition section. It defines &#39;Court&#39; to mean, in the city of Madras, the Madras City Civil Court and elsewhere, the Subordinate Judge&#39;s Court having jurisdiction, and if there is no such Subordinate Judge&#39;s Court, the District Court having jurisdiction. A &quot;Harijan Welfare Scheme&quot; is defined to mean any scheme for provision of house sites for Harijans, for constructing, extending or improving any dwelling house for Harijans, for providing any burial or burning ground for Harijans, for providing any pathway leading to such dwelling house, burial or burning ground or for providing any other amenity for the benefit of Harijans. Sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the said Act read thus:\r\n\r\n&quot;4. Power to acquire land.- (1) Where the District Collector is satisfied that for the purpose of any Harijan Welfare Scheme, it is necessary to acquire any land, he may acquire the land by publishing in the District Gazette a notice to the effect that he has decided to acquire the land in pursuance of this section. (2)Before publishing a notice under sub- section (1), the District Collector or any officer authorised by the District Collector in this behalf, shall call upon the owner or any other person, who, in the opinion of the District Collector or the officer so authorised may be interested in such land, to show cause why it should not be acquired. (3)(a) The District Collector may, where he has himself called upon the owner or other person to show cause under sub-section (2), pass such orders as he may deem fit on the cause so shown;\r\n\r\n(b)Where any officer authorised by the District Collector has called upon the owner or other person to show cause under sub- section (2), the officer so authorised shall make a report to the District Collector containing his recommendations on the cause so shown for the decision of the District Collector. After considering such report the District Collector may pass such orders as he may deem fit.\r\n\r\n5.Land acquired to vest in Government free from all encumbrances.- When a notice under sub-section (1) of Section 4 is published in the District Gazette, the land to which the said notice relates shall, on and from the date on which the notice is so published vest absolutely in the Government free from all encumbrances.\r\n\r\n6.Right to receive amount.- Every person having any interest in any land acquired under this Act shall be entitled to receive and be paid an amount as hereinafter provided.\r\n\r\n7.Determination of amount.- (1) The amount payable in respect of any land acquired under this Act shall be the market value of such land on the date of publication of the notice under sub-section (1) of Section 4.&quot; Section 8 sets out the matters that are to be ignored in determining the amount under Section 7. Section 9 entitles any person who does not agree with the amount determined by the prescribed authority under Section 7(2) to prefer an appeal to the &#39;Court&#39; within such period as may be prescribed. Sub-section (1) of Section 10 requires the prescribed authority to determine who, in his opinion, are entitled to receive the amount where several persons claim to be interested therein and what is payable to each of them. Sub- section (2) states that where a dispute arises in this behalf the prescribed authority may refer it for the decision of the court and the court must, in deciding such dispute, follow the provisions of Part III of the Land Acquisition Act. Section 11 reads thus: &quot;11. Payment of amount.- (1) After the amount has been determined, the prescribed authority shall tender payment of the amount to the persons entitled thereto and shall pay it to them-\r\n\r\n(i)in a lump sum in a case where it does not exceed two thousand rupees,and\r\n\r\n(ii)in all other cases, in such number of equal annual instalments not exceeding five as may be determined by the prescribed authority and the amount of each such annual instalment shall not be less than two thousand rupees: Provided that where the balance of the amount due in any instalment is less than two thousand rupees, only the actual amount so due shall be paid.\r\n\r\n(2)If the persons entitled to the amount do not consent to receive it or if there be no person competent to alienate the land, or if there be any dispute as to the title to receive the amount, or as to the apportionment of it, the prescribed authority shall deposit the amount in the Court, and the Court shall deal with the amount so deposited in the manner laid down in Sections 32 and 33 of the Land Acquisition &#39;Act, 1894 (Central Act I of 1894).&quot;\r\n\r\nSection 12 provides for payment of interest. It says that when the compensation amount is not paid or deposited on or before taking possession of the land, the prescribed authority shall pay it with interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the time of taking possession until payment. Section 13 reads thus:\r\n\r\n&quot;13. Appeal to High Court.- Subject to the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Central Act V of 1908) applicable to appeals from original decrees, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any enactment for the time being in force, a second appeal shall lie to the High Court from any decision of the Court under this Act, if the amount as determined by the prescribed authority exceeds such sum as may be prescribed.&quot;\r\n\r\nSection 20 states that the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, save as provided in the said Act, shall cease to apply to any land which is required for the purpose specified in Section 4(1) and such land shall be acquired only in accordance with the provisions of the said Act. Section 22 reads thus:\r\n\r\n&quot;22. Application of the Act to certain pending cases of acquisition.- (1) The provisions of this Act shall apply also to any case or cases in which proceedings have been started before the commencement of this Act for the acquisition of any land for the Harijan Welfare Scheme under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (Central Act I of 1894) (hereinafter in this section referred to as the said Act) but no award has been made by the Collector under Section 11 of the said Act before such commencement, as if-\r\n\r\n(i) the notification published under sub- section (1) of Section 4 of the said Act, or\r\n\r\n(ii)the declaration made under Section 6 of the said Act, or\r\n\r\n(iii)the notice given under sub-section (1) of Section 9 of the said Act, were a notice to show cause against the acquisition of the land served under sub- section (2) of Section 4 of this Act. (2)Nothing contained in sub-section (1) shall apply in relation to any land unless and until after&#39; the District Collector has published a notice in the District Gazette to the effect that the said land is required for the purpose specified in sub-section (1) of Section 4 of this Act.&quot;\r\n\r\n5. It was submitted by learned counsel for the respondents that no enquiry as required by Section 5 of the Land Acquisition Act was contemplated by the said Act. Whereas it was the Government which was required to consider objections and the need for acquisition and make a declaration thereafter that the land was required for a public purpose under the Land Acquisition Act, it was, under the said Act, left to the District Collector to be satisfied that the land was required for the purpose of a Harijan Welfare Scheme. No enquiry into the value of the land was contemplated under the said Act inasmuch as a provision equivalent to Section 11 of the Land Acquisition Act was not to be found in the said Act.\r\n\r\nWhereas the Land Acquisition Act set out the matters that were required to be considered for the purposes of award of compensation there was no such provision in the said Act. The said Act did not provide for a reference to the court in regard to a claim for enhancement of compensation in the manner of Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act; it provided only for an appeal to the court and, having regard to the terms of Section 9, that appeal was restricted to the amount of solatium payable under Section 7(2) of the said Act. Section 11 of the said Act provided for the payment of the compensation amount in instalments in the event that the amount thereof exceeded Rs 2000. Section 13 of the said Act provided for a second appeal to the High Court only if the amount as determined by the prescribed authority exceeded such sum as might be prescribed. This sum, it may be mentioned, was at the relevant time Rs.50,000, which was the amount prescribed for the purposes of all second appeals to the High Court under the rules for the purpose.\r\n\r\n6. In State of M.P v. G.C. Mandawar1 a Constitution Bench held that Article 14 does not authorise the striking down of the law of one State on the ground that, in contrast with the law of another State on the same subject, its provisions are discriminatory, nor does it contemplate the law of the Centre or of a State dealing with similar subjects being held to be unconstitutional by a process of comparative study of the provisions of the two. The sources of authority for the two being different, Article 14 can have no application. In Sant Lal Bharti v. State of Punjab2 this was reiterated.\r\n\r\n7. When a statute is impugned under Article 14 what the court has to decide is whether the statute is so arbitrary or unreasonable that it must be struck down. At best, a statute upon a similar subject which derives its authority from another source can be referred to, if its provisions have been held to be reasonable or have stood the test of time, only for the purpose of indicating what may be said to be reasonable in the context. We proceed to examine the provisions of the said Act upon this basis.\r\n\r\n8. Sub-section (1) of Section 4 empowers the District Collector, if he is satisfied that it is necessary to acquire some land for the purpose of a Harijan Welfare Scheme, to acquire that land by publishing in the District Gazette a notice to the effect that he has decided to acquire it in pursuance of Section 4. Sub-section (2) of Section 4 obliges the District Collector or any officer authorised by him in this behalf to call upon the owner or any other person who, in the opinion of the District Collector or the officer so authorised, is interested in such land to show cause why it should not be acquired. Where the District Collector has called upon the owner or other person to show cause under sub-section (2), clause (a) of sub-section (3) requires him to pass orders on the cause so shown. Where an officer authorised by the District Collector has called upon the owner or other person to show cause under sub-section (2), clause (b) of Section 3 requires that officer to report to the District Collector his recommendations on the cause so shown and the 1 (1955) 1 SCR 599 AIR 1954 SC 493 2 (1988) 1 SCC 366 (1988) 2 SCR 107 District Collector is required to pass such orders as he may deem fit after considering the report. Sub-section (2) of Section 4, therefore, obliges the acquiring authority to serve notice upon the landowner and other persons interested in the land to show cause why it should not be acquired. By reason of sub-section (3) of Section 4, such cause has to be taken into account and orders passed in respect thereof. It is only thereafter that the acquiring authority can arrive at the satisfaction that it is necessary to acquire the land. The provisions of Section 4, therefore, substantially encapsulate the provisions of Sections 4 to 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, the only major difference being that, under the said Act, it is the District Collector and not the State Government who must be satisfied that the land is required to be acquired. It does not appear to us that this is a provision whi ch is unreasonable or arbitrary.\r\n\r\n9.By reason of Section 5, the land in respect of which notice under Section 4(1) is published vests absolutely in the State\r\n This appeal by special leave is filed by the State of Tamil Nadu against the judgment and order of the High Court of Madras dated 9-9-1981, where by the Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for Harijan Welfare Schemes Act, 1978, was struck down as being ultra vires the Constitution of India. The High Court came to the conclusion that the said Act did not enjoy the protection of Articles 31-C or 31-A and that it was violative of Articles 14, 19 and 300-A of the Constitution. These civil appeals each party shall bear and pay its own costs.\r\n ','D.B. Madan Vs Commissioner Of Income-Tax JUDGMENT\r\n\r\n1. Heard learned counsel on both sides.

The High Court declined to call upon the Appellate Tribunal to state a case and refer a question of law said to arise out of the Tribunal&#39;s appellate order for its opinion. The circumstance that, in doing so, the High Court relied on a decision which in turn followed an earlier one in CIT v. T.S. Hajee Moosa and Co. (Mad) implied that a question of law did arise, but the question, in view of the earlier decision, was held as not a referable question of law. It is always open to the High Court to follow its earlier decision and answer the question of law one way or the other according as whether the view taken in the earlier case commends itself to it or whether, in its opinion, that earlier view needs reconsideration. But it cannot always be said that, in all cases where a similar question of law had been answered in an earlier case in a\r\n High Court declined to call upon the Appellate Tribunal to state a case and refer a question of law said to arise out of the Tribunal&#39;s appellate order for its opinion.

Hindustan Co-operative Insurance Society Ltd., 58 I.A. 259, Ramswarup v. Munshi &amp; Ors. [1963] 3 SCR 858; Bolani Ores Ltd. v. State of Orissa, [1975] 2 SCR 138; referred to.\r\n\r\n(c) Section 55 is an instance of legislation by incorporation and not legislation by reference. In enacting s. 55 the legislature did not want to confer an unlimited right of appeal but wanted to restrict it. It found that the grounds set out in the then existing s. 100 CPC were appropriate for restricting the right of appeal and hence incorporated them in s.55. The legislature could never have intended to limit the right of appeal to any ground or grounds which might from time to time find place in s. 100 without knowing what those grounds were. [1063 B-D]\r\n\r\n(d) Secondly, the Act is a self-contained code and it is not possible to believe that the legislature could have made the right of appeal under such a code dependent on the viscititudes of a section in another statute. [1063 F]\r\n\r\n(e) That apart, an indissoluble link between s. 55 and s. 100, CPC would lead to a startling result. If, for example, s. 100 were repealed, s. 55 would be reduced to futility and the right of appeal under the Act would be wholly gone. It would be absurd to place on the language of s. 55 an interpretation which might in a given situation result in denial of the right of appeal altogether and thus defeat the plain object and purpose of the section. [1063 H]\r\n\r\n(f) Even assuming that the right of appeal under s.55 is restricted to the ground specified in the new s. 100 CPC the present appeal would still be maintainable because it involves a substantial question of law relating to the interpretation of s. 13(2) of the Act. [1064 D]\r\n\r\n(g) The test for determining whether a question of law raised in an appeal is a substantial question of law is to see whether it is of general public importance or whether it directly or substantially affects the rights of parties and if so whether it is an open question in the sense that it is not finally settled by this Court or by the Privy Council or by the Federal Court or is not free from difficulty or call for discussion of alternative views. [1064 E] Sir Chunilal V. Mehta &amp; Sons Ltd. v. The Century Spinning and Manufacturing Co. Ltd., [1962] Supp. 3 SCR 549; referred to.\r\n\r\nIn the present case the appeal clearly involves a substantial question of law within the meaning of the Act, because the interpretation of s. 13(2) directly and substantially affects the rights of the parties and is not finally settled by this Court.\r\n\r\n2(a) The words &quot;in the manner in which it was made-&#39; occurring in s. 13(2) have no bearing on the content or the scope and ambit of the power but merely indicate the procedure to be followed by the Commission in amending or revoking an order made by it. [1064 H]\r\n\r\n(b) The power conferred under s. 13(2) is of the widest amplitude and in this respect it is unlike s. 22 of the English Act. This power is intended to ensure that the order passed is and continues to be in conformity with the requirements of the Act, and the trade practice condemned by the order is really and truly a restrictive trade practices and it must therefore, be construed in a wide sense so as to effectuate the object and purpose of the grant of the power. [1065 B]\r\n\r\n(c) The powers under s. 13(2) and s. 55 are distinct and independent powers and one cannot be read as subject to the other. The scope and applicability of s. 13(2) is not cut down by the provision for appeal under s. 55. It is perhaps because the right of appeal given under s. 55 is limited to a question of law that a wide and unfettered power is conferred on the Commission to amend or revoke an order in appropriate cases. [1066 A]\r\n\r\n(d) The conferment of such wide and unusual power under s. 13(2) was necessary to ensure that an erroneous order is capable of being corrected. An order made under s. 37 or under any other provision of the Act may affect not only the parties before the Commission but also others such as the whole net-work of distributors or dealers who were not before the Commission. It may also affect the entire trade in the product. There may be some Facts or circumstances having a crucial bearing on the determination of the enquiry which, if taken into account, may result in a different order being made or some fact or circumstance may arise which may expose the invalidity of the order or render it bad. There may be a material change in the relevant circumstances subsequent to the making of the order. Therefore, by its very nature. the order of the Commission is transient or pro-tempore and must be liable to be altered or revoked according as there is material change in the relevant economic facts and circumstance. [1366 B-E]\r\n\r\n(e) But howsoever large may be the power under s. 13(2), it cannot be construed to be so wide as to permit a rehearing on the same material without anything more with a view to showing that the order was wrong on facts. [1067]\r\n\r\n(f) When Regulation 85 says that the provisions of s. 114 and O. XLVII, r. 1 CPC shall as far as may, be applied to the proceedings under s. 13(2) it cannot be read to mean that an application under s. 13(2) can be maintained only on the grounds set out in s. 114 and O. XLVII r. 1. This regulation does not in any manner limit the width and amplitude of the power under s. 13(2). A good part of it is procedural in nature and has nothing to do with the grounds on which an application under s. 13(2) may be maintained. The words &quot;as far as may&quot; occurring in its last part do not indicate that an application under s. 13(2) can be maintained only on the grounds set out in s. 114 and O. XLVII, r. 1, CPC. All that they indicate is that the provisions of s. 114 and O. XLVII, r. 1 are to be invoked only to the extent applicable, and if in a given case they are not applicable they may be ignored; but that does not mean that the power conferred under s. 13 (2) would not be exercisable in such a case. The reference to the provisions of s. 114 and O. XLVII, r. 1 does not limit the grounds on which an application may be made under s. 13(2). Clearly, therefore, even if a case does not fall within s. 114 and O. XLVII, r. 1, the Commission would have power in an appropriate case to amend or revoke an order made by it in the exercise of its power under s. 13(2). [1067 E-H] 3(a) The power of the Commission under s. 13(2) was exercisable in the present case and the order dated 14th May 1976 was liable to be revoked. [1077 B]\r\n\r\n(b) The submission of the distributorship agreement for registration under s. 33 cannot be construed as admission on the appellant&#39;s part that the clauses in the agreement constituted restrictive trade practices. The appellant had possibly submitted the agreement for registration on the erroneous view (which was also the view of the Commission in the Telco case) that the moment an agreement contains a trade practice falling within any of the clauses of s. 33(1) the trade practice must, irrespective of whether it falls within the definition of s. 2(o) or not, be regarded as a restrictive trade practice and the agreement must be registered. The question whether a particular trade practice is restrictive or not is essentially a question of law based on the application of the definition in s. 2(o) to the facts of a given case and no admission on a question of law can ever be used, in evidence against the make of the admission. Therefore, even assuming that there was an admission in submitting the agreement for registration it could not be used as evidence against the appellant in the enquiry under s. 37. [1075 C-G]\r\n\r\n(c) There was nothing in the conduct of the appellant which would amount to acquiescence or raise an estoppel against it. The appellant did not at any time, accept the impugned order knowing that it was erroneous. There can be no acquiescence without knowledge of the right to repudiate or challenge. [1068 H]\r\n\r\n(d) Neither did the failure of the appellant to prefer an appeal amount to acquiescence on its part because an application under s. 13(2), which is An alternative and a more effective remedy, was available to it. [1069 G]\r\n\r\n(e) The fact that the appellant did not implement the impugned order by entering into revised distributorship agreements with its distributors also showed that there was no acquiescence on its part so far as the order dated 14th May 1976 was concerned. [1070 C]\r\n\r\n(f) Estoppel can arise only if a party to a proceeding had altered his position on the faith of a representation or promise made by another. In the instant case there is nothing to show that the Registrar had altered his position on the basis of the application for extension of time made by the appellant. [1107 D] 4(a). The order of the Commission was bad because it was based on no material and, could not possibly have been made by the Commission. [1076 A-B]\r\n\r\n(b) The definition of restrictive trade practice in the Act is, to some extent, based on the rule of reason evolved by American courts while interpreting a similar provision in the Sherman Act. The rule of reason normally requires ascertainment of facts or features peculiar to the particular business, its condition before and after the restraint was imposed, the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable, the history of the restraint and the evil believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular restraint and the purpose sought to be attained. It is only on a consideration of these factors that it can be decided whether a particular act, contract or agreement imposing the restraint is unduly restrictive of competition so as to constitute restraint of trade. Certain restraint of trade are unreasonable per se because of their pernicious effect on competition and lack of any redeeming virtue; they are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and, therefore, illegal without elaborate enquiry as to the precise harm they have caused or the business execuse for their use. In such cases illegality does not depend on a showing of the unreasonableness of the practice and it is unnecessary to have a trial to show the nature, extent and degree of its market effect. [1074 A, B; 1075 A-B]\r\n\r\n(c) It is now settled law that every trade practice which is in restraint of trade is not necessarily restrictive trade practice. If a trade practice merely regulates and thereby promotes competition it would not fall within the definition even if it is to some extent in restraint of trade. Therefore, the question whether a trade practice is a restrictive trade practice or not has the decided not on any theoretical or a priori reasoning. but by inquirie whether it has or may have the effect of preventing distorting or restricting competition. The peculiar facts and features of the trade would be very much relevant in determining this question. [1072 H]\r\n\r\n(d) In the Telco case this Court laid down that an application by the Registrar under s. 10(a) (iii) must contain facts which in his opinion constitute restrictive trade practice and show or establish as to how the alleged clauses constitute restrictive trade practice in the context of the facts. But even if the application does not set out any facts or features showing how the trade practices complained of by the Registrar are restrictive practices, the Registrar can still, at the hearing of the enquiry, in the absence of any demand for particulars being made by the opposite party produce material before the Commission disclosing facts or features which go to establish the restrictive nature of the trade practice complained of and if that is done, the defect in the application would not be of much consequence. [1070 G-H] In the instant case the burden of producing the necessary material that the impugned trade practices had the actual or probable effect of diminishing or destroying competition and were therefore restrictive trade practices was on the Registrar who made on application before the Commission. No material beyond reproducing the impugned clauses of the agreement and the words of the relevant sections having been produced, the application of the Registrar was contrary to the law laid down by this Court. Therefore, the Commission had no basis for making its order dated 14th May 1976.\r\n\r\n(e) The argument that the trade practices referred to in the offending clauses were per se restrictive trade practices and in any event, even if any supporting material was necessary, it was to be found in the admission of the appellant contained in its letter submitting the distributorship agreement for registration was without any force.\r\n\r\n5(a). When the issue before the court is whether a practice trade practice set out in an agreement has or may have the effect of preventing, distorting or restricting competition so as to constitute a restrictive trade practice, it is the actual or probable effect of the trade practice which has to be judged and there is no question of contradicting, varying, adding to or substracting from the terms of the agreement by admitting extraneous evidence. The various factors stated earlier are required to be taken into account only for the purpose of determining the actual or probable effect of the trade practice referred to in the particular clause. In such a case it is not right to shut out oral evidence to determine the actual or probable effect of the trade practice. [1078 D-E]\r\n\r\n(b) It is not s. 33(1) which invalidates a clause in an agreement relating to a trade practice but it is the restrictive nature of the trade practice as set out in s. 2(o) which makes it void. [1079 E]\r\n\r\n(c) When a question of restrictive trade practice arises in relation to a clause in an agreement it is the trade practice in the clause that has to be examined for determining its actual or probable effect on competition. A clause in an agreement may proprio vigore impose a restraint. Where such restraint produces or is reasonably likely to produce the prohibited statutory effect it would clearly constitute a restrictive trade practice and the clause would be bad. [1108 D-E] Tata Engineering &amp; Locomotive Co. Ltd., Bombay,, v. The Registrar of the Restrictive Trade Agreement New Delhi, [1977] 2 SCR 685, applied.\r\n\r\nObservations in Hindustan Lever Ltd. v. M.R.T.P. [1977] 3 SCR 455; disapproved.\r\n\r\n(d) In a case where a clause in agreement does not by- itself impose any restraint but empowers the manufacturer or supplier to take some action which may be restrictive of competition, the mere possibility of action being taken, which may be restrictive of competition, would not in all cases affect the legality of the clause. What is required to be considered for determining the legality of the clause is whether there is a real probability that the presence of the clause itself would be likely to restrict competition. This is basically a question of market effect and cannot be determined by adopting a doctrainaire approach. Each case would have to be examined on its own facts from a business and commonsense point of view. It cannot, therefore, be said that in every case where the clause is theoretically capable of being so utilised as to unjustifiably restrict competition it would constitute a restrictive trade practice. [1081 E-H] 6(a). The order dated 14th May 1976 was clearly vitiated by an error of law apparent on the face of the record inasmuch as it contained only the final and operative order without giving any reasons in support of it. [1083 E]\r\n\r\n(b) The two conditions precedent before the Commission can pass a cease and desist order are (i) it must be found that the trade practice complained of is a restrictive trade practice and (ii) where such a finding is reached the Commission must be satisfied that none of the &quot;gateways&quot; pleaded in answer to the complaint exists. [1082 D-E]\r\n\r\n(c) In the instant case the appellant did not appear before the Commission and no &#39;gateways&quot; were pleaded and therefore the question of the Commission arriving at a satisfaction in regard to &quot;gateways&quot; did not arise. Nonetheless the Commission was required to be satisfied that the trade practices complained of were restrictive trade practices. The order dated 14th May 1976 did not contain any discussion showing that the Commission had reached the requisite satisfaction. It gave merely bald directions without any reasons. The ex-parte character of the order did not absolve the Commission from the obligation to give reasons in support of the order because the appellant would have been entitled to prefer an appeal even against on ex-parte order and in the absence of reasons, the appellant would not be in a position to attack the order in appeal. It is well established that every quasi-judicial order must be supported by reasons. [1082 E-H] N.M. Desai v. Textiles Ltd., C.A. 245 of 1970, dec. On 17th Dec., 1975; Simons Engineering Co. v.

Datar and Girish Chandra for Respondent No. 2.\r\n\r\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATI, J.-This appeal under section 55 of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) raises interesting questions of law relating to the interpretation and application of certain provisions of the Act. The facts giving rise to the appeal are for the most part undisputed and they may be briefly stated as follows:\r\n\r\nThe appellant is a public limited company engaged in manufacture and sale of jeep motor vehicles and their Spare parts and accessories. Since 1947 the appellant was marketing and distri-\r\n\r\nbuting jeep motor vehicles and it had set up a large and complex net work of dealers, who were described as distributors, for marketing and after sale service of such vehicles. In or about 1956 the appellant started manufacturing its own jeep motor vehicles and since then it has been manufacturing such vehicles and distributing and marketing the same through its net work of distributors. The appellant has appointed these distributors for marketing and sale of jeep motor vehicles on certain terms and conditions contained in a standard distributorship agreement. The material clauses of this agreement read as follows:\r\n\r\n&quot;Section (3): TERRITORY OF DISTRIBUTOR:-` The Company grants to Distributor the non-exclusive privilege (except as hereinafter provided) of selling at re tail and the right (except hereinafter provided) to appoint in writing by forms of agreements approved by the Company, Dealers to sell at retail the products enumerated in Section 2 of this agreement, within the following territory and also demarcated in the map attached hereto and which forms a part of this agreement.\r\n\r\nDistributor accepts the above retail setting privileges and agrees to develop with diligence the sales of sale products in said territory in accordance with this agreement and undertakes to achieve the quantum of sales in the territory as may be fixed by the Company from time to time.\r\n\r\nSection (4): LIMITATIONS ON TERRITORIAL RIGHTS:-\r\n\r\n(i) Distributor agrees not to solicit outside of the territory described in Section 3-the purchase of any products.\r\n\r\n* * * * Section (6): PRICE AND PAYMENT :-Distributor will pay for products the Company&#39;s established Distributor net prices in effect on date on despatch. Price lists will be furnished to Distributor by the Company, but the Company reserves the right to change prices at any time without notice.\r\n\r\n* * * * Section (11): PRICE CHANGES :-If the Company reduces its published suggested retail list price, for any current model of &#39;Jeep&#39; motor vehicles, the company will make an allowance to Distributor as hereinafter provided. The allowance shall be made in respect of new and unused &#39;Jeep&#39; Motor Vehicles of the then current model in respect of which the price change has been made which `have been purchased by Distributor from the Company within a period of 30 (thirty) days prior to the effective date of such decrease in suggested list price, and which distributor shall have in his unsold stock on such effective date. The allowance shall be equal to the difference between the net amount paid to the Company for such &#39;Jeep&#39; Motor Vehicle (less all allowance thereto granted), and the net amount which would have been paid had such &#39;Jeep&#39; motor vehicles been purchased at the reduced price. No allowance, how ever, shall be made unless there is a reduction in the RETAIL list price and increases in discounts, bonuses and the like shall in no event be considered as a reduction in price.\r\n\r\n* * * * Section (17): CARE OF OWNER AND CUSTOMER RELATIONS :- Distributor agrees-\r\n\r\n* * * *\r\n\r\n(a) To refrain from selling or offering for sale any competing product. The Company shall be the sole judge as to whether a product is competing or not&quot;\r\n\r\nThe appellant by its letter dated 27th January, 1971 submitted to the Registrar of Restrictive Trade Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the Registrar) certified copies of agreements entered into by the appellant with the Distributors for registration, since in the opinion of the appellant, they were registrable under the provisions of Ch. V of the Act. The appellant also submitted to the Registrar along with its letter dated 19th May, 1972 four copies of the standard distributorship agreement for registration in terms of cl. (ii) of Rule 12 of the Monopolies Restrictive Trade Practices Rules, 1970 (hereinafter referred to as the Rules) and the standard distributorship agreement was registered by the Registrar under section 35 of the Act.\r\n\r\nOn 17th December, 1975 the Registrar made an application to 11 the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission (hereinafter referred to as the Commission) under section 10(a) (iii) of the Act pointing out to the Commission that the standard distributorship agreement entered into by the appellant with the distributors was filed by the appellant for registration in the office of the Registrar and the same had been duly registered under section 35 of the Act. The Registrar drew the attention of the Commission to clauses (3), (4), (5), (6), (11), (13), (14), (17) and (20) of the standard distributorship agreement and claimed that the provisions contained in these clauses related &quot;to restrictive trade practices relating to imposing restrictions on persons and classes of persons to whom goods are sold and from whom goods are bought tie-up sales/full-line forcing; exclusive dealing; granting or allowing concessions; discounts, over- riding commission, etc. in connection with or by reason of dealings; resale price maintenance; and allocation of area/market for disposal of products covered under the agreement, respectively attracting clauses (a), (b), (c),\r\n\r\n(e), (f) and (g) of section 33(1) and/or section 2(o) of the Act&quot; and that these restrictive trade practices had and might have the effect of preventing, distorting and restricting competition and tended to bring about monopolisation of prices and conditions of delivery and to affect the flow of supplies in the market relating to goods covered under the standard distributorship agreement in such manner as to impose on the consumers unjustified costs and restrictions and the same were prejudicial to public interest. The Registrar prayed on the basis of these allegations that the Commission be pleased to inquire into the restrictive trade practices indulged in by the appellant, under section 37 of the Act and pass such orders as it might deem fit and proper. The Commission, on receipt of this application, decided, in exercise of the powers conferred upon it under sections 10(a) and 37 of the Act, to hold inquiry into the restrictive trade practices complained of by the Registrar and issued notice dated 2nd January, 1976 under Regulation 53 of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission Regulations, 1974 (hereinafter referred to as the Regulations) to the appellant that if the appellant wished to be heard in the proceedings before the Commission, it should comply with the requirements of Regulations 65 and 67 failing which the Commission would proceed with the inquiry in the absence of respondent. The appellant, by its letter dated 3rd February, 1976, acknowledged receipt of the notice and intimated to the Commission that it did not wish to be heard in the proceedings before the Commission but put forward its submissions in regard to the restrictive trade practices alleged by the Registrar in his application. The appellant pointed out that the clauses of the standard distributionship agreement complained of by the Registrar did not constitute restrictive trade practices for the reasons explained in the letter and requested the Deputy Secretary to place their submissions before the Commission at the enquiry to be held by it. The letter was purported to be submitted in terms of Regulations 36(3), but the reference to this Regulation was obviously under some misapprehension because this Regulation occurred in Chapter V which provided the procedure for reference under Chapter III and IV and it had no application in case of an inquiry under section 37 of the Act. The Joint Secretary (Legal) of the Commission pointed out to the appellant by his letter dated 11th February, 1976 that if the appellant wished to be heard in the proceedings, the appellant should comply with the requirements of Regulations 65 and 67 and it is only if the appellant did so, that it could file a reply in answer to the application of the Registrar and moreover, the reply had to be properly drawn and duly verified and declared as provided in those Regulations. The Joint Secretary. (Legal) made it clear that in view of this legal position obtaining under Regulations 65 and 67, it was not possible to take note of contents of the letter addressed by the appellant setting out the explanation for the various clauses impugned in the application of the Registrar. Though this position, in law was specifically pointed out by the Joint Secretary (Legal) on behalf of the Commission, the appellant did not comply with the procedure set out in Regulations 65 and 67 with the result that the Commission decided to proceed exparte against the appellant. The Registrar filed an affidavit of the Assistant Registrar dated 10th May, 1976 in support of the allegations contained in the application but this affidavit surprisingly did not contain any further or other material than that set out in the application. No other evidence, oral or documentary, was produced by the Registrar and the Commission proceeded to decide the issues arising in the enquiry on the basis of the application supported by the affidavit of the Assistant Registrar. The Commission, after going through the application and the affidavit of the Assistant Registrar and hearing the Registrar, made an order dated 14th May, 1976, the operative part of which was in the following terms:\r\n\r\n&quot;(1) The Respondent is hereby restrained and prohibited by any agreement with any distributor to restrict by any method the persons or classes or persons to whom the goods are sold whether such person be retail purchaser or a dealer.\r\n\r\n(2) The Respondent is hereby restrained and prohibited from restricting in any manner, any purchaser whether a dealer or otherwise in the course of its trade from acquir-\r\n\r\ning or otherwise dealing in any goods other than those of the Respondent or the goods of any other person. (3) The Respondent is hereby restrained and prohibited from selling any goods to any distributor, dealer or other wise on the condition that the prices to be charged on resale by the purchaser shall be the prices stipulated by the respondent unless it is clearly stated that prices lower than those prices may be charged. The Respondent is hereby directed that in all future price lists it must state on the cover or on the front page that the prices if any indicated therein as resale prices are maximum prices and that the prices lower than those price may be charged.\r\n\r\n(4) The Respondent is hereby restrained and prohibited from allocating any area or market to any distributor or dealer for the disposal of the Respondent&#39;s goods. (5) The Respondent is hereby restrained and prohibited from preventing any distributor from appointing any dealer of its own choice on such terms and conditions as may be mutually agreed upon between distributors and dealers in cases where the Respondent does not undertake any obligation, liability or responsibility in respect of the dealers.\r\n\r\n(6) The clauses in the agreements relating to the above restrictive trade practices are hereby declared to be void. The practices arising therefore, shall be discontinued and shall not be repeated. (7) The Respondent shall within 3 months from the date of service of this order on it make and file an affidavit before the Commission setting out the manner in which this order has been given effect to. A copy of the said affidavit shall simultaneously be furnished to the Registrar.\r\n\r\n(8) There will be no order as to costs.&quot;\r\n\r\nSince the appellant was required to file an affidavit of compliance within three months as directed by cl. (7) of the Order, the appellant filed an affidavit dated 10th September, 1976 stating that the appellant had fully implemented in practice the directions contained in Paragraphs (1) and (5) of the Order and refrained from enforcing against the distributors any of the clauses which had been declared void by the Commission. The appellant also pointed out that a draft of a new distributorship agreement was being finalised by the appellant with a view to giving effect to the &quot;restrictions and prohibitions&quot; contained in the Order. The Registrar filed an affidavit of the Deputy Registrar dated 27th September, 1976 seeking particulars from the appellant showing how the appellant had implemented the directions contained in the Order. The appellant by its reply dated 11th November, 1976 pointed out that since the date of receipt of the Order, the appellant had not given effect to the trade practices covered by paragraphs (1) to (5) of the Order nor required any of the distributors to abide by the clauses of the standard distributorship agreement relating to those trade practices and on the contrary, intimated to the distributors that the old distributorship agreement would have to be substituted by a new revised agreement. The appellant submitted that since the clauses of the standard distributorship agreement declared void by the Commission were not enforceable in law by the appellant, it did not make any difference whether or not they were deleted from the existing distributorship agreement and in view of the fact that a new revised agreement was being prepared which would comply with the directions contained in the Order, it was not necessary, to effect any amendments in the existing distributorship agreement. It seems that there was a hearing before the Commission on this issue as regards compliance with the directions contained in the Order and the draft of the revised distributorship agreement prepared by the appellant was considered and pursuant to the suggestion made by the Commission, the appellant agreed to amend two clauses in the draft and the Commission by its Order dated 7th December, 1976 directed that the revised distributorship agreement should be filed by the appellant by 31st March, 1977.\r\n\r\nNow, it appears that subsequent to the Order of the Commission dated 7th December, 1976 an important decision was given by this Court in Tata Engineering &amp; Locomotive Co. Ltd., Bombay v. The Registrar of the Restrictive Trade Agreement, New Delhi(&#39;) relating to the interpretation of some of the relevant provisions of the Act bearing on restrictive trade practices. This decision was given in all appeal preferred by Tata Engineering Locomotive Co. Ltd. (herein- after referred to as the Telco against an order made by the Commission in an enquiry under section 37 and it reversed the view taken by the Commission in several important respects. Though this decision was given on 21st January, 1977, it was not fully reported until March 1977 and on reading it, the appellant felt that the order of the Commission dated 14th May, 1976 required reconsideration, as it was contrary to the law laid down in this decision. The appellant accordingly made an application to the Commission on 31st March. 1977 where, besides asking for extension of time for filing a copy of the revised distributorship agreement on the ground that the dealers were spread out all over India and it would take considerable time for execution of the revised distributorship agreement by them, the appellant pointed out that it had not contested the enquiry proceedings under section 37 in the first instance because the decision given by the Commission in the Telco case was directly applicable, but since that decision of the Commission was reversed by this Court in appeal, the appellant was advised to move a suitable application for amendment and/or modification of the Order dated 14th May, 1976 and that was also an additional reason why the time for filing the revised distributorship agreement should be extended, so that the revised distributorship agreement could be in accordance with the directions, if any. which might be given by the Commission on the proposed application. The Commission acceded to the request contained in this application and extended the time for filing the revised distributorship agreement upto 4th June, 1977.\r\n\r\nThe appellant thereafter made an application dated 30th May, 1977 under section 13(2) of the Act read with Regulation 85 for revocation, amendment or modification of the Order of the Commission dated 14th May, 1976. The appellant set out in this application various facts and features relating to its trade of manufacture and sale of Jeep motor vehicles and their spare parts and accessories and enumerated a number of grounds on which the order of the Commission dated 14th May, 1976 deserved to be revised, revoked, amended or otherwise modified. The application was opposed by the Registrar by filing a reply dated. 17th August, 1977. The parties were thereafter heard by the Commission on 26th August, 1977 and pursuant to the directions given by the Commission. affidavits of documents were filed and evidence was recorded on both sides. It appears that in the course of the evidence the appellant came to know that in November 1977 Hindustan Motors Ltd. had introduced in the 6 market diesel trekker which was clearly a competing vehicle and the appellant thereupon applied to the Commission on 30th January. 1978 for amendment of the application by adding a plea that the fact that since November 1977 Hindustan Motor Ltd. had started manufacturing and selling diesel trekker which was a highly competitive product was another material change in the relevant circumstances which justified the revocation, amendment or modification of the Order dated 14th May, 1976. This application for amendment was opposed by the Registrar on the ground that it was made at a very late stage of the proceeding. The Commission did not pass any order on this application for amendment and kept it pending and proceeded to dispose of the main application by an Order dated 28th February, 1978 by which it rejected the main application with costs and added a short order On the same day stating that in view of the order on the main application, there would be no order on the application for amendment. The appellant thereupon preferred the present appeal in this Court under section 55 challenging the validity of the order made by the Commission rejecting the application of the appellant.\r\n\r\nBefore we set out the rival contentions of the parties in the appeal, it would be convenient at this state to refer to the relevant provisions of the Act and the Regulations. Section 2 is the definition section and clause (u) of this section defines &#39;trade practice&#39; to mean &quot;any practice relating to the carrying on of any trade, and includes-(i) anything done by any person which controls or affects the price charged by, or the method of trading of, any trader or any class of traders (ii) a single or isolated action of any person in relation to any trade&quot;. &#39;Restrictive trade practice&#39; is defiled in section 2, clause (o) to mean &quot;a grade practice which has, or may have, the effect of preventing distorting or restricting, competition in any manner and in particular,-(i) which tends to obstruct the flow of capital or resources into the stream of production, or (ii) which tends to bring about manipulation of prices, or conditions of delivery or to affect the flow of supplies in. the market relating to goods or services in such manner as to impose on the consumers unjustified costs or restrictions.&quot; Section 5, subsection (1) provides for the establishment of the Commission which is to consist of a Chairman and not less than two and not more than eight other members to be appointed by the Central Government and sub- section (2) of section 5 lays down that the Chairman shall be a person who is or has been or is qualified to be a judge of the Supreme Court or of a High Court. It is obvious from these two sub-sections of section 5 that the Legislature clearly contemplated that the Commission must have a Chairman who would provide the judicial element and there must be at least two other members who would provide expertise in subjects like economics, law, commerce. accountancy, industry, public affairs or administration. so that there could be a really high-powered expert commission competent and adequate to deal with the various problems which come before it. It, however, appears that the Central Government paid scant regard to this` legislative requirement and though the office of Chairman fell vacant as far back as 9th August, 1976, it failed to make appointment of Chairman until 24th February, 1978. Of the two other members of the Commission one had already resigned earlier and his vacancy was also not filled with the result that the Commission continued with only one member for a period of about 18 months. This was a most unfortunate state of affairs, for it betrayed total lack of concern for the proper constitution and functioning of the Commission and complete neglect of its statutory obligation by the Central Government. We fail to see any reason why the Central Government could not make the necessary appointments and properly constitute the Commission in accordance with the requirements of the Act. It is difficult to believe that legal and judicial talent in the country had become so impoverished that the Central Government could not find a suitable person to fill the vacancy of Chairman for a year and a half. Moreover it must be remembered that the appointments, after all, have to be made from whatever legal and judicial talent is available and the situation is not going to improve by waiting for a year or two: a new star is not going to appear in the legal firmament within such a short time and the appointments cannot be held up indefinitely. Indeed, it is highly undesirable that important quasi-judicial or administrative posts should remain vacant for long periods of time, because apart from impairing the efficiency of the functioning of the statutory authority of the administration. inexplicable delay may shake the confidence of the public in the integrity of the appointments when made. Turning back to the provisions of the Act, we find that section 10(a) (iii) empowers the Commission to inquire into any restrictive trade practice upon an application made to it by the Registrar. The powers of the Commission while holding an enquiry under the Act are enumerated in section 12 and section 13, sub-section (2) provides that &quot;any order made by the Commission may be amended or revoked at any time in the manner in which it was made&quot;. Then follow sections 14 to 19 which deal inter alia with the procedure to be followed by the Commission. We are not concerned with Sections 20 to 32 which occur in Chapters III and IV because they deal with topics other than restrictive trade practices. Chapter V relates to registration of agreements relating to restrictive trade practices and it consists of sections 33 to 36 of which only sections 33 and 35 are material. Sub- section (1) of section 33 provides that any agreement relating to a restrictive trade practice falling within one or more of the categories specified there shall be subject to registration in accordance with the provisions of Ch. V and proceeds to enumerate the categories of restrictive trade practices covered by that provision and section 35 lays down the time within which an agreement falling within section 33, sub-section (1) shall be registered and the procedure to be followed for effectuating such registration. Sections 37 and 38 are the next important sections and they occur in Ch. V headed A &quot;control of certain restrictive trade practices&quot;. Sub-section (1) of section 37 provides that &quot;the Commission may inquire into any restrictive trade practice, whether the agreement, if any, relating thereto has been registered under section 35 or not, which may come before it for inquiry and, if after such inquiry it is of opinion that the practice is prejudicial to the public interest, the Commission may, by order, direct that-(a) the practice shall be discontinued or shall not be repeated, (b) the agreement relating there to shall be void in respect of such restrictive trade practice or shall stand modified in respect thereof in such manner as may be specified in the order&quot;. Section 38, sub-section (1) enacts that for the purposes of any proceedings before the Commission under section 37, a restrictive trade practice shall be deemed to be prejudicial to the public interest unless the Commission is satisfied of any one or more of the circumstances set out in that subsection and is further satisfied, after balancing the competing considerations, that the restriction is not unreasonable. These circumstances specified in sub-section (1) of section 38 render a trade practice permissible even though it is restrictive and provide what have been picturesquely described in the English law as &quot;gateways&quot; out of the prohibition of restrictive trade practices. Section 55 is the next relevant section and it provides that any person aggrieved by any order made by the Central Government under Ch. III or Ch. IV or as the case may be, of the Commission under section 13 or section 37 may, within 60 days from the date of the order, prefer an appeal to the Supreme Court on &quot;one or more of the grounds specified in section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908&quot;. This is the section under which the present appeal has been preferred by the appellant. The last section to which we must refer is section 66 which confers power on the Commission to make Regulations for the efficient performance of its functions under the Act. The Commission has, in exercise of the power conferred by this section, made the Regulations of which three arc material. namely, Regulations 65, 67 and 85. These Regulations, in so far as material, read as follows &quot;Section 65: APPEARANCE OF PARTIES : Every respondent who wishes to be heard in the proceedings shall within 14 days of the service upon him of the copy of the notice of enquiry, enter an appearance in the office of the Commission by delivering to the Secretary six copies of a memorandum stating that the respondent wishes to be heard in the proceedings and containing the name of his advocate having an office in Delhi or New Delhi and duly authorised to accept service of processes and the Secretary shall send one copy of the memorandum to the Registrar in case where proceedings are initiated under sub- clause (iii) of clause (a) of section 10, and in all other cases to the Director of Investigation.&quot; &quot;Section 67: REPLY TO THE NOTICE: Every respondent who has entered an appearance shall within four weeks of his entering appearance deliver to the Secretary a reply to the notice (5 copies) which shall include:-\r\n\r\n(a) particulars of each of the provisions of section 38 of Act on which he intends to rely; and\r\n\r\n(b) particulars of the facts and matters alleged by him to entitle him to rely on such provisions.&quot; &quot;Section 85: AMENDMENT OR REVOCATION OF ORDER ETC.: An application under sub-section (2) of section 13 of the Act for amendment-or revocation of any order made by the Commission in any proceedings shall be supported by evidence on affidavit of the material change in the relevant circumstances or any other fact or circumstances on which the applicant relies. Unless the Commission otherwise directs notice of the application together with copies of the affidavits in support thereof, shall be served on every party who appeared at the hearing of the previous proceedings and every such party shall be entitled to be heard on the application and the provisions of section 114 and Order XLVII of the Code of Civil Procedure, &#39;908 (5 of 1908), shall as far as may, be applied to these proceedings.&quot; It is against the background of these provisions of the Act and the Regulations that we have to determine the question arising for consideration in the appeal.\r\n\r\nThe contention of the appellant in support of the appeal was that the Order dated 14th May, 1976 suffered from various infirmities and was liable to be revoked or in any event modified under section 13(2) of the Act. It was said that the application of the Registrar on which the Order dated 14th May, 1976 was made did not set out any facts or features showing how the trade practices referred to in the application were restrictive of competition so as to constitute restrictive trade practices and merely contained a bald recital of the impugned clause and mechanical reproduction of the language of the relevant sections without anything more. The application of the Registrar was thus not in accordance with the law laid down in the decision of this Court in the Telco case and no order could be made upon it by the Commission. It was also urged that there was no material placed before the Commission by the Registrar on the basis of which the Commission could possibly come to the conclusion that the trade practices referred to in the application were restrictive trade practices. Even if the Commission was justified in proceeding exparte against the appellant, the highest that could be assumed in favour of the Registrar was that the facts set out in the application and the supporting affidavit of the Assistant Registrar would be deemed to be admitted, but, apart from the impugned clauses, no other facts were set out either in the application or in the affidavit of the Assistant Registrar and there was accordingly no evidence on which the order dated 14th May, 1976 could be made by the Commission. It was also contended that the Order dated 14th May, 1976 did not set out any facts peculiar to the trade of the appellant or the conditions before and after the imposition of the restraint or the actual or probable effect of the restraint nor did it indicate as to how the trade practices referred to in the impugned clauses constituted restrictive trade practices; it was a non-speaking order which did not give any reasons at all for holding that the trade practices complained of were restrictive trade practices and hence it was vitiated by a legal infirmity. The appellant further urged that the Order dated 14th May, 1976 was a continuing order as it required the appellant not merely to cease but also to desist from the restrictive trade practices set out in the order and it was, therefore, required to be continually justifiable and since the facts and features of the trade set out in the application of the appellant clearly established that the trade practices referred to in the impugned clauses did not constitute restrictive trade practices, the Order dated 14th May, 1976 was not justified and in any event could not be continued and it was accordingly liable to be revoked or amended under section 13(2). It was submitted that in any event the Order dated 14th May, l 976 was contrary to the law declared by this Court in the Telco case and since the decision in the Telco case was a fact or circumstance subsequent to the making of the Order, it justified the invocation of the power under section 13(2) for revoking or modifying the Order. Lastly, it was contended that in any view of the matter there was a material change in the relevant circumstances subsequent to the making of the Order dated 14th May, 1976 in that Hindustan Motor Ltd. started manufacturing and marketing competing utility vehicles since June 1976 and this was sufficient to warrant reconsideration of the Order under section 13 (2) . The respondents raised a preliminary objection against the maintainability of the appeal on the ground that under section 55 read with the newly substituted section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, an appeal could lie to this Court only on a substantial question of law and since the contentions raised on behalf of the appellant did not raise any substantial question of law, the appeal was not maintainable. The respondents also urged that on a proper construction of section 13(2) read with Regulation 85, the Commission could revoke or amend the Order dated 14th May, 1976 only if there was a material change in the relevant circumstances since the making of the Order or any of the grounds specified in Order XLVlI rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 was available to the appellant. The second and third grounds specified in Order XLVII, rule 1 obviously did not exist in the present case and the claim of the appellant for exercise of the power under section 13(2) could, if at all, rest only on the first ground, namely error of law apparent on the face of the record. But, said the respondents, there was no error of law apparent on the face of the record so far as the Order dated 14th May, 1976 was concerned, nor was there any material change in the relevant circumstances subsequent to the making of the order and hence section 13(2) was not attracted. The respondents contended that what the appellant was seeking to achieve by the application under section 13(2) was reconsideration of the Order dated 14th May, 1976 which was clearly impermissible, since section 13(2) could not be used as a substitute, for section 55 and that too, without the restrictive condition of that section. It was also urged on behalf of the respondents that, in any event the appellant was precluded from challenging the Order dated 14th May, 1976 by an application under Section 13(2) by reason of its subsequent conduct in acquiescing in the Order and unconditionally accepting the same. The appellant clearly waived the defects or infirmities if any in the Order dated 14th May, 1976 and was precluded from raising any contention against the validity of that Order. The respondents disputed validity of the contentions raised on behalf of the appellant and urged that in any event even if any of these defects or infirmities were present, they did not render the Order void as being without jurisdiction and hence the validity of the Order could not be challenged in the collateral proceedings under section 13(2). The respondents also contended that in any view of the matter the Order dated 14th May, 1976 was justified inasmuch as the trade practices complained of by the Registrar were restrictive trade practices. These were the rival contentions urged on behalf of the parties and we shall now proceed to examine The first question that arises for consideration in the preliminary objection of the respondents is as to what is the true scope and admit of an appeal under section 55. That section provides inter alia that any person aggrieved by an order made by the Commission under section 13 may prefer an appeal to this Court on &quot;one or more of the grounds specified in section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908&quot;. Now at the date when section 55 was enacted, namely, 27th December, 1969, being the date of coming into force of the Act, section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure specified three grounds on which a second appeal could be brought to the High Court and one of these grounds was that the decision appealed against was contrary to law. It was sufficient under section 100 as it stood then that there should be a question of law in order to attract the jurisdiction of the High Court in second appeal and, therefore, if the reference in section 55 were to the grounds set out in the then existing section 100, there can be no doubt that an appeal would lie to this Court under section 55 on a question of law. But subsequent to the enactment of section 55 section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure was substituted by a new section by section 37 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1976 with effect from 1st February, 1977 and the new section 100 provided that a second appeal shall lie to the High Court only if the High Court is satisfied that the case involves a substantial question of law. The three grounds on which a second appeal could lie under the former section 100 were abrogated and in their place only one ground was substituted which was a highly stringent ground, namely, that there should be a substantial question of law. This was the new section 100 which was in force on the date when the present appeal was preferred by the appellant and the argument of the respondents was that the maintainability of the appeal was, therefore, required to be judged by reference to the ground specified in the new section 100 and the appeal could be entertained only if there was a substantial question of law. The respondents leaned heavily on section 8(1) of the General Clauses Act, 1897 which provides:\r\n\r\n&quot;8(1) Where this Act, or any Central Act or Regulation made after the commencement of this Act, repeals and re-enacts, with or without modification, any provision of a former enactment, then references in any other enactment or in any instrument to the provision so repealed shall, un-\r\n\r\nless a different intention appears, be construed as references to the provision so re-enacted.&quot;\r\n\r\nand contended that the substitution of the new section 100 amounted to repeal and re-enactment of the former section 100 and, therefore, on an application of the rule of interpretation enacted in section 8(1), the reference in section 55 to section 100 must be construed as reference to the new section 100 and the appeal could be maintained only on the ground specified in the new section 100, that is, on a substantial question of law. We do not think this contention is well founded. It ignores the distinction between a mere reference to or citation of one statute in another and an incorporation which in effect means bodily lefting a provision of one enactment and making it a part of another. Where there is mere reference to or citation of one enactment in another without incorporation, section 8(1) applies and the repeal and re-enactment of the provision referred to or cited has the effect set out in that section and the reference to the provision repealed is required to be construed as reference to the provision as re-enacted. Such was the case in the Collector of Customs, Madras v. Nathella Sampathu Chetty &amp; Anr. and the New Central Jute Mills Co. Ltd. v. The Assistant Collector of Central Excise, Allahabad &amp; Ors. But where a provision of one statute is incorporated in another, the repeal or amendment of the former does not affect the latter. The effect of incorporation is as if the provision were written out in the incorporating statute and were a part of it. Legislation by incorporation is a common legislative device employed by the legislature, where the legislature for convenience of drafting incorporates provisions from an existing statute by reference to that statute instead of setting out for itself at length the provisions which it desires to adopt. Once the incorporation is made, the provision incorporated becomes an integral part of the statute in which it is transposed and thereafter there is no need to refer to the statute from which the incorporation is made and any subsequent amendment made in it has no effect on the incorporating statute. Lord Esher, M.R., while dealing with legislation in incorporation in In re. Wood&#39;s Estate (1886) 31 Ch.D. 607 pointed out at page 615:\r\n\r\n&quot;If a subsequent Act brings into itself by reference some of the clauses of a former Act, the legal effect of that, as has often been held, is to write those sections into the new Act.\r\n\r\njust as if they had been actually written in it with the pen, or printed in it, and, the moment you have those clauses in the later Act, you have no occasion to refer to the former Act at all.&quot;\r\n\r\nLord Justice Brett, also observed to the same effect in Clark v. Bradlaugh (1881) 8 Q.B.D. 63 at 69 :\r\n\r\n&quot; there is a rule of construction that, where a statute is incorporated by reference into a second statute, the repeal of the first statute by a third statute does no affect the second.&quot;\r\n\r\nThis was the rule applied by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Secretary of State for India in Council v. Hindustan Cooperative Insurance Society Ltd. The Judicial Committee pointed out in this case that the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 having been incorporated in the Calcutta Improvement Trust Act, 1911 and become an integral part of it, the subsequent amendment of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 by the addition of sub-section (2) in section 26 had no effect on the Calcutta Land Improvement Trust Act, 1911 and could not be read into it. Sir George Lowndes delivering the opinion of the Judicial Committee observed at page 267 :\r\n\r\n&quot;In this country it is accepted that where a statute is incorporated by reference into a second statute, the repeal of the first statute does not affect the second: see the cases collected in Craies on Statute Law, 3rd edn. pp. 349, 350.\r\n\r\n\r\n	  x		x	      x		     x\r\n	      x	   x   x    The independent existence of the\r\n\r\n\r\ntwo Acts is, therefore, recognized; despite the death of the parent Act, its offspring survives in the incorporating Act. x x x It seems to be no less logical to hold that where certain provisions from an existing Act have been incorporated into a subsequent Act, no addition to the former Act, which is not expressly made applicable to the subsequent Act, can be deemed to be incorporated in it, at all events if it is possible for the subsequent Act to function effectually without the addition.&quot;\r\n\r\nSo also in Ramswarup v. Munshi &amp; Ors., it was held by this Court that since the definition of &quot;agricultural land&#39; in the Punjab Alienation of Land Act, 1900 was bodily incorporated in the Punjab Pre-emption Act, 1913, the repeal of the former Act had no effect on the continued operation of the latter. Rajagopala Ayyangar, J., speaking for the Court observed at pages 868- 869 of the Report:\r\n\r\n&quot;Where the provisions of an Act are incorporated by reference in a later Act the repeal of the earlier Act has, in general, no effect upon the construction or effect of the Act in which its provisions have been incorporated.\r\n\r\nx x x x In the circumstances, therefore, the repeal of the Punjab Alienation of Land Act of 1900 has no effect on the continued operation of the Pre-emption Act and the expression &#39;agricultural land&#39; in the latter Act has to be read as if the definition in the Alienation of Land Act had been bodily transposed into it.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe decision of this Court in Bolani Ores Ltd. v. State of Orissa also proceeded on the same principle. There the question arose in regard to the\r\n Area 10(a) (iii) of the Monopolies and Restrictive Exchange Practices Act, 1969 empowers the Monopolies and Prohibitive Trade Practices Commission to enquire into any prohibitive exchange hones upon an application made to it by the Registrar of Restrictive Trade Agreements. Segment 13(2) gives that &quot;any request made by the Commission might be revised or repudiated whenever in the way in which it was made.&quot; Section 55 gives that any individual distressed by an arrange made by the Central Government or the Commission under s. 13 or s. 37 may incline toward an interest to the Supreme Court on one or more of the grounds determined in s. 100, Code of Common Procedure, 1908. On the date on which the Act came into drive s. 100 C.P.C. indicated three grounds on which a moment bid could mislead the High Court one of them being that the choice claimed against was opposite to law. By an correction made in 1976 s.100 was substituted by a new segment which gives that a moment bid should deceive the High Court just if the High Court is fulfilled that the case includes a considerable question of law. The appealing party, who was a producer of jeep engine vehicles, their save parts and embellishments, submitted for enrollment to the Registrar of Restrictive Trade Understandings, standard distributorship assentions went into by it with its merchants. After registering the understandings, in his application to the Commission, the Enlistment center charged that certain conditions in the assention identified with prohibitive exchange rehearses and that some of them were biased to open intrigue. The litigant, in answer to the Commission&#39;s notice, expressed that it didn&#39;t wish to be heard in the procedures prior to the Commission, bringing up while there was nothing in the decried provisions of the understanding which could be said to constitute prohibitive exchange hones the reasons whereof had as of now been clarified in its answer. 1039 The Registrar documented before the Commission a testimony in support of his application yet that too did not contain any further or extra material than what was set out in his application. No other confirmation, oral or narrative, was delivered by him before the Commission in support of the affirmation that the agreement constituted a prohibitive exchange rehearse. By its request dated May 14, 1976 the Commission pronounced certain provisions of the litigant&#39;s distributorship assention to be void. While correspondence was going on between the Enlistment center and the litigant on the accommodation of a changed distributorship understanding, this Court in Tata Engineering and Train Co. Ltd. v. Enlistment center of Restrictive Trade Rehearses, [1977] 2 SCR 685 gave its understanding on the pertinent arrangements of the Act. Immediately the appealing party made an application to the Commission calling attention to that it did not challenge the enquiry procedures under s. 37 in the first occasion in light of the fact that the Commission&#39;s choice in the Telco case was specifically pertinent; yet now that that choice had been turned around by the Supreme Court in request, its request dated May 14, 1976 required correction/change. An application under s. 13 (2) read with control 85 was in like manner made for denial, correction or modification of the Commission&#39;s request of May 14, 1976. The Commission rejected this application by a request dated 28th February 1978. In its allure under s. 55 of the Act impugning the Commission&#39;s request dated 28th February 1978 the appealing party battled that (1) the Registrar&#39;s application claiming prohibitive exchange hones did not set out any actualities demonstrating how the litigant&#39;s exchange practices were prohibitive in nature and that the Registrar&#39;s application not having been made as per the law set around this Court in Telco case the denounced arrange of the Commission was subject to be denied or adjusted under s. 13(2); (2) the request did not give any purposes behind its choice as was vitiated; and (3) the order was a proceeding with request in light of the fact that it required the appealing party not merely to stop but also cease from the prohibitive exchange rehearses set out in the arrange and was, in this way required to be persistently reasonable and since it was, in opposition to the law set down in Telco case it was at risk to be repudiated or revised; in any occasion the choice of this Court being ensuing to the making of the Commission&#39;s order, there was sufficient legitimization for repudiating or modifying the request under s. 13(2) of the Act. The respondent, then again, battled that (1) on a use of the control of understanding authorized in s. 8(1) or the General Clauses Act, reference in s. 55 to s. 100 C.P.C. must be understood as a kind of perspective to the new s. 100, C.P.C. thus understood an interest to the Supreme Court would lie just if the case included &quot;a considerable question of law&quot; and not generally and since for this situation no such question was included, the interest was not viable; (2) s. 13(2) couldn&#39;t be utilized by the litigant as a substitute for s. 55; and (3) by reason of its consequent lead in assenting in the Commission&#39;s request and genuinely tolerating it, the litigant was blocked from raising any dispute against its legitimacy in offer to this Court. Permitting the interest, ^ HELD: The appeal is viable under s. 55 of the Act. [1064 C] 1(a) On a legitimate understanding of s. 55 it must be held that the grounds speci- 1040 fied in the then existing s. 100 CPC were joined in s. 55 and the substitution of the new s. 100 did not influence or confine the grounds as joined in s. 55. In any occasion, the present interest brings up generous issues of law, and so is viable. [1064 C] (b) There is a refinement between a unimportant reference to then again reference of one statute in another and a consolidation. Where there is a minor reference to or reference of one establishment in another without consolidation, s. 8(1) of the General Clause Act applies and the annulment and re-order of the arrangement alluded to or refered to has the impact set out in that area and the reference to the arrangement canceled is required to be interpreted as reference to the arrangement as re-established. In any case, where a provision of one statute is consolidated in another, the annulment or revision of the former does not influence the last mentioned. The effect of consolidation is as though the arrangement incorporated were worked out in the incorporting statute and were a piece of it. Once the consolidation is made, the arrangement joined turns into an indispensable part of the statute in which it is transposed and thereafter there is no compelling reason to allude to the statute from which the consolidation is made and any resulting change made in it has no impact on the consolidating statute.

','Shamkant Narayan Despande Vs Maharashtra Industrial CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Special Leave petition (c) No.\n4748 of 1991.\nFrom the Judgment and Order dated 21.1.91 of the Bombay High\nCourt in W.P. No. 3481 of 1990.\nN.B. Shetye,  P.M.  Pradhan  and  A.M.	khanwilkar  for	 the\npetitioner.\nDushyant Dave, Beliram Vakil, Abrar Ali, Ajit Yogi, Gajender\nLal, Mukul Gupta and Ms. Sonia Khan for the Respondents.\nThe Judgment of the court was delivered by\n     SAWANT,  J.   The	petitioner  is	diploma-  holder  in\nEngineering  and holds the post of Executive Engineer in the\nrespondent-Corporation. Till 1974, the promotion post of the\nsuperintending Engineer	 was  available	 both  for  diploma-\nholders and degree-holders according to merit-cum-seniority.\nThis was  so according	to  the	 practice  followed  by	 the\nCorporation without  making any	 rules or regulation in that\nbehalf. In  1974, the corporation made regulation by passing\na resolution  by passing a resolution and continued the same\npractice. Admittedly,  the regulation  were not	 made  under\nsection 64  of the  Maharashtra Industrial  Development Act,\n1961 [hereinafter  referred to as the &apos;Act&apos;] under which the\nrespondent-corporation was  created. Thereafter in 1988, the\ncorporation passed a resolution, for the first time,. making\n75 per	cent of	   the	posts  of  superintending  engineers\navailable to  the executive Engineers holding degrees and 25\nper cent  to  the  Executive  Engineers	 who  were  diploma-\nholders.  This	 resolution  was   also	 admittedly   not  a\nregulation made	 under the   said  section 64.	But for this\nresolution, the	 petitioner who was senior to respondent NO.\n2 would	 have been  promoted to	 the post  of Superintending\nEngineer on  31st October,  1990. However,  since respondent\nNo.2 was a degree holder, he got the said resolution and was\npromoted to the said post on that date. It is this promotion\nwhich was challenged by the petitioner by a writ petition in\nthe High  Court. The  High Court  by the  impugned  judgment\ndismissed the said petition.\n     2.	 Two   contentions  were  raised\n     before us.\n     (i) that no classification could be\n     made among	 the Executive Engineers\n     on the  basis of  their educational\n     qualification for	the  purpose  of\n     promotion	 to    the    post    of\n     superintending Engineer, since they\n     belong  to	  the  same   cadre   of\n     Executive Engineers and do the same\n     work.  There   was	 also  a  common\n     seniority	  of	the    Executive\n     Engineers	maintained.   hence  the\n     classification  was  discriminatory\n     in nature and violative of Articles\n     14 and 16 of the Constitution .\n     (ii)  that	  if  at   all	such   a\n     discrimination was	 permissible, it\n     could be  made only  be a statutory\n     rule  or  regulation  framed  under\n     Section 64	 of the said Act. A mere\n     resolution	   or	 an    executive\n     instruction could	not effect  such\n     discrimination.\n3.   We find  not merit in either of the two contentions. It\nis now	well settled  that for	the purpose  of promotion, a\nvalid classification  can made among the members holding the\nsame post  on the  basis of their qualification. In state of\nJummu &amp;	 Kashmir v.  Triloki Nath Khosa &amp; Ors., [1974] 1 SCR\n771, a Constitution Bench of his court has clearly held that\nsuch a	classification is  permissible and  does not violate\nArticles 14  and  16  of  the  Constitution  the  Court	 has\nobserved there that in state of Mysore &amp; Anr. v. P. Narasing\nRao, [1968]  1 SCR  407 and The Union of India and others v.\nDr.(Mrs.) S.B.	Kholi, AIR  1973 SC 811, it was already held\nthat   classification	 on   the   basis   of	 educational\nqualification was  permissible. The  Court then	 referred to\nRoshan Lal  Tandon v.  Union of India, [1968] 1 SCR  185 and\ndistinguished it  on the facts by pointing out that it was a\ncase of	 the direct  recruits and  promotees integrated into\none cadre.  Once they  were integrated they lost their birth\nbirth-marks, viz.  the different   sources  from which	they\nwere recruited.	 [Emphasis supplied].  The court pointed out\nthat Roshan Lal&apos;s case [supra] was thus no authority for the\nproposition that  if direct  recruits  and    promotees	 are\nintegrated into	 one class  they cannot	 be  classified	 for\npurposed of promotion on a basis other than that in the case\nbefore the them the classified for purpose of promotion on a\nbasis  other  than  that  they	were  drawn  from  different\nsources. The  court also  pointed out  that the	 very  Bench\nwhich decided  Roshan Lal&apos;s    case  [supra]  he Constitution of India, Art.14, Art.16 - Promotion to post of Superintending Engineer - Classification of degree-holder and confirmation holder Executive Engineers - Not violative Arts. 14 and 16. \r\n\r\nMaharashtra Industrial Development Act (3 of 1962), S.64. \r\n\r\nAIR 1983 SC 881, Held per incuriam. \r\n\r\nAIR 1974 SC 1, Foll. \r\n\r\nAdvancement - Classification among same class on premise of capabilities - Permissible. \r\n\r\nMaharashtra Industrial Development Act (3 of 1962), S.63 - Promotion to post of Superintending Engineer - Classification of degree holder and confirmation holder Executive Engineers - Made by Corporation by passing simple determination - Not illicit. \r\n\r\nAuthoritative law - Change in administration condition by passing simple determination - allowable. \r\n\r\nStates of Service - Can be changed by official guidelines.\r\n\r\nheld: The proposition that in the absence of the rules and regulations, the authority can act by executive instruction finds direct support in Mysore state Road Transport Corporation v. Gopinath Gundachar char, {1968] 1 SCR 767 and v. Balasubramaniam and others v. Tamil Nadu housing Board and others, [1987] 4 SCC 738.\r\n\r\nIn view of the above, the petition stands dismissed.

Inasmuch as the issue of remaining land of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n143   bighas   raised   by   the   respondents   is   pending   before   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nRevenue   Minister,   the   same   is   not   relevant   for   our   present \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(5)    It   is   the   contention   of   the   learned   counsel   for   the   State \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   the   order   dated   23.04.1969   about   the   grant   of   603.16 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbighas of land (including 460.15 bighas - the subject matter of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npresent proceedings) was ex facie without jurisdiction as it was \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nallotted   by   the  PHED  on  flimsy   and  fallacious   grounds  about \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncancellation   of   patta   way   back   in   the   year   1942   and   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompensation sought in the year 1968.   It is relevant to note \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat the same was cancelled way back in 1973.   Inasmuch as \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopportunity of hearing was not given, the learned single Judge \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof the High Court, by order dated 24.11.1976, remanded back \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto the State Government for     deciding the matter afresh after \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngiving due opportunity of hearing to the respondents herein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(6)    On   behalf   of   the   State,   it   was   pointed   out   that   it   has \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlegitimate   grievance   with   the   allotment   dated   23.04.1969   by \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  PHED.     The cancellation was made way back in the year \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1942   for   allotment   made   in   the   year   1941   on   the   ground   of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nviolation   of   lease   conditions.     The   respondents   have   claimed \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhuge   compensation   for   construction   said   to   have   been   made \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nduring   subsistence   of   lease   in   the   year   1949   itself   and   filed \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplication for compensation with regard to the cancellation of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npatta   in   the   year   1968.     According   to   the   State,   the   said \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplication   was   barred   by   limitation   and   it   was   also   filed \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbefore wrong forum, i.e., the PHED, when it should have been \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfiled   before   the   Land   Revenue   Department,   which   is   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappropriate Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(7)    It   is   also   the   grievance   of   the   State   that   the   allotment \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndated 23.04.1969  was cancelled on 01.05.1973,  however, the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHigh   Court   set   aside   the   same   on   24.11.1976   on   the   limited \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nground that there was violation of natural justice and directed \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   State   Government   to   decide   it   afresh   after   giving \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopportunity   of   hearing.     In   those   circumstances,   the   State \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwants to exercise its power under the Land Revenue Act read \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith the orders passed by the learned single Judge of the High \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCourt   dated   24.11.1976   and   the   Revenue   Minister   dated \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15.12.1992.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(8)    It   was   highlighted   that   the   judgment   of   the   trial   Court \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndated 30.06.1982 is also nullity since there was no discussion \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non   merits   with   regard   to   the   validity   of   allotment   dated \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n23.04.1969. Though it was pointed out by the counsel for the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrespondents that it was hit by the principle of  res judicata  as \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclarified by the counsel for the appellants, the principle of  res  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njudicata shall only apply if there is discussion or finding on the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsame   subject   matter.     A   perusal   of   the   decree   of   injunction \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   had   been   passed   on   23.04.1969   shows   that   it   did   not \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadvert to the merits of the case at all.  It is also not in dispute \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   the   subject   Property - Notice for reviewing - Objections against the notice for reviewing the request permitted by High Court - Hence, introduce claim - Held, arrive being referred to has a place with the Revenue Department of the State of Rajasthan and the PHED had no purview at all to reestablish 460.15 bighas of land for the Respondents - It was unnecessary to specify that while passing crisp requests as coordinated, the State Government needed to issue notice to every one of the gatherings concerned and choose the same as per law - Appeals permitted. Appeals Allowed','Dahyabhai Ranchhoddas Dhobi &amp; Anr Vs State Of Gujarat &amp; Ors P. Sathasivam, J.\n\n1) Leave granted.\n\n2) This appeal is directed against the judgment and order\n\ndated 12.01.2009 passed by the High Court of Gujarat at\n\nAhmedabad in Special Civil Application No. 5663 of 1990\n\nwith Civil Application No. 3458 of 2006 whereby the High\n\nCourt dismissed the petition preferred by the appellants\n\nherein.\n\n\n\n\n \n3) Brief facts:\n\na)   According to the appellants, they are owners of the\n\nland in question measuring 848.66 sq.m., Nandh No.\n\n2190/P, Ward No.4 of Surat City.        The State of Gujarat\n\ninitiated   acquisition   proceedings    under   the   Land\n\nAcquisition Act, 1894 (hereinafter referred to as the \"Act\")\n\nfor construction of a school in the land in question under\n\nthe Surat Municipal Corporation. The appellants objected\n\nto the said acquisition on the ground that:\n\n(i) this is the only land for them for carrying on the\n\nbusiness of washermen and they are using this land for\n\nthe purpose of their livelihood.\n\n(ii) There are vacant/open lands adjoining to the land in\n\nquestion.\n\n(iii) Within a radius of 1 km., number of schools are\n\navailable particularly being run by the Surat Municipal\n\nCorporation.\n\n\n\n\n \n(iv) While acquiring the land, the respondents have not\n\nfollowed the provisions of Sections 4, 5, 6 and 11A of the\n\nAct.\n\nb)     On the other hand, it is the stand of the State\n\nGovernment that:\n\n(i) the land is required for establishing a primary school by\n\nthe Surat Municipal Corporation.\n\n(ii) They fully complied with the statutory notices and\n\nother requirements.\n\n(iii) The appellants did not avail the opportunity of\n\nparticipating in the 5A enquiry by filing objections.\n\n(iv) The declaration made under Section 6 of the Act is\n\nwithin time.\n\n(v) Award under Section 11A has been passed within the\n\nstatutory period. Since the establishment of school is for\n\na public purpose and in view of compliance of all the\n\nstatutory formalities, there is no merit in the appeal and\n\nprayed for dismissal of the same.\n\n\n\n\n \n4)   Heard Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel for\n\nthe appellants and Mr. Prashant G. Desai, learned senior\n\ncounsel for the Surat Municipal Corporation and Ms.\n\nHemantika Wahi, learned counsel for the State of Gujarat.\n\n5)   Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel for the\n\nappellants has raised the following contentions:\n\na)   there was no hearing/enquiry in terms of Section 5A\n\nof the Act which is mandatory;\n\nb)   the locality publication was not effected under\n\nSection 6(2);\n\nc)   the Award passed under Section 11A was not made\n\nwithin two years from the date of last publication of\n\nnotification under Section 6, therefore the acquisition is\n\nvitiated;\n\nd)   after change of classification of the land in question,\n\nnamely, residential use, the respondents are not permitted\n\nto establish a primary school which is not permissible;\n\ne)   In view of the fact that the area being designated as\n\nresidential congested by houses on either side, it is not a\n\n \nfit place for establishing a school as observed by this\n\nCourt in Avinash Mehrotra vs. Union of India and\n\nOthers, (2009) 6 SCC 398.\n\n6)   On the other hand, Mr. Prashant G. Desai, learned\n\nsenior counsel for the Surat Municipal Corporation has\n\nsubmitted that in view of Section 12 (2) (b) and Section 20\n\n(1) of the Gujarat Town Planning &amp; Urban Development\n\nAct, 1976, the State Government is well within their\n\npowers in establishing a primary school in Surat.       He\n\nfurther submitted that all the statutory provisions have\n\nbeen strictly complied with and the declaration under\n\nSection 6 and Award under Section 11A were duly made\n\nwithin the prescribed time. Ms. Hemantika Wahi, learned\n\ncounsel appearing for the State, by drawing our attention\n\nto specific averments in the counter affidavit submitted\n\nthat the appellants having not filed objections in the\n\nenquiry under Section 5A, all the three modes of\n\npublication as contemplated under Section 6 were duly\n\npublished and made and Award passed within the\n\n \nprescribed period, there is no infirmity in the acquisition\n\nproceedings and prayed for dismissal of the appeal.\n\n7)   We    have    considered     the   rival   contentions   and\n\nperused the relevant materials.\n\n8)   With regard to the first objection as to enquiry under\n\nSection 5A of the Act though the appellants have stated\n\nthat they were not given an opportunity of being heard, in\n\nthe counter affidavit filed by the Special Land Acquisition\n\nOfficer,   Surat   before   the   High    Court    it   has   been\n\nspecifically asserted that notification under Section 4 in\n\nthe Official Gazette was published on 09.03.1989, public\n\nnotice displayed at the office of Mamlatdar of the\n\nconcerned Ward on 20.04.1989 and hearing of objections\n\nunder Section 5A was fixed on 20.05.1989. In para 4 of\n\nthe counter affidavit, the Land Acquisition Officer has\n\nspecifically stated that appellants were given several\n\nopportunities for hearing their objections from time to\n\ntime. The hearing was fixed on 29.05.1989, 05.06.1989,\n\n12.06.1989, 20.09.1989, 28.09.1989 and 16.10.1989 and\n\n \nthe appellants were heard through their lawyer Mr.\n\nKashyap H. Shukla.           In view of the above specific\n\ninformation the contention contrary to the same is liable\n\nto be rejected.\n\n9)   The second objection is that locality publication was\n\nnot effected under Section 6(2) of the Act.       In the same\n\ncounter   affidavit,   the   Land   Acquisition   Officer   has\n\nasserted that publication of notification under Section 6\n\nwas published in the Gazette dated 21.03.1990.          Public\n\nNotice displayed at the office of Mamlatdar of the\n\nconcerned Ward on 19.04.1990. In the light of the said\n\ninformation, the claim that no publication of notice in the\n\nlocality under Section 6(2) cannot be accepted.\n\n10) The third and the important objection relates to\n\npassing of Award under Section 11A. It is the stand of the\n\nappellants that Award was not made within two years\n\nfrom the date of last publication of Notification under\n\nSection 6 hence the acquisition is vitiated.      Since heavy\n\nreliance was placed on the said objection, it is useful to\n\n \nrefer Section 6 and Section 11A of the Act which reads\n\nthus:\n\n    \"6. Declaration that land is required for a public\n    purpose.- (1) Subject to the provision of Part VII of this Act,\n    when the appropriate Government is satisfied, after\n    considering the report, if any, made under section 5A, sub-\n    section (2), that any particular land is needed for a public\n    purpose, or for a Company, a declaration shall be made to\n    that effect under the signature of a Secretary to such\n    Government or of some officer duly authorized to certify its\n    orders and different declarations may be made from time to\n    time in respect of different parcels of any land covered by the\n    same notification under section 4, sub-section (1)\n    irrespective of whether one report or different reports has or\n    have been made (wherever required) under section 5A, sub-\n    section (2);\n\n    Provided that no declaration in respect of any particular\n    land covered by a notification under section 4, sub-section\n    (1)-\n\n    (i) published after the commencement of the Land\n    Acquisition (Amendment and Validation) Ordinance, 1967 (1\n    of 1967), but before the commencement of the Land\n    Acquisition (Amendment) Act, 1984 shall be made after the\n    expiry of three years from the date of the publication of the\n    notification; or\n\n    (ii) published after the commencement of the Land\n    Acquisition (Amendment) Act, 1984 shall be made after the\n    expiry of one year from the date of the publication of the\n    notification:\n\n    Provided further that no such declaration shall be made\n    unless the compensation to be awarded for such property is\n    to be paid by a Company, or wholly or partly out of public\n    revenues or some fund controlled or managed by a local\n    authority.\n\n    Explanation 1. - In computing any of the periods referred to\n    in the first proviso, the period during which any action or\n    proceeding to be taken in pursuance of the notification\n    issued under section 4, sub-section (1), is stayed by an order\n\n\n \nof a Court shall be excluded.\n\nExplanation 2. - Where the compensation to be awarded for\nsuch property is to be paid out of the funds of a corporation\nowned or controlled by the State, such compensation shall\nbe deemed to be compensation paid out of public revenues.\n\n(2) Every declaration shall be published in the Official\nGazette, and in two daily newspapers circulating in the\nlocality in which the land is situated of which at least one\nshall be in the regional language, and the Collector shall\ncause public notice of the substance of such declaration to\nbe given at convenient places in the said locality (the last of\nthe dates of such publication and the giving of such public\nnotice, being hereinafter referred to as the date of the\npublication of the declaration), and such declaration shall\nstate the district or other territorial division in which the\nland is situate, the purpose for which it is needed, its\napproximate area, and, where a plan shall have been made\nof the land, the place where such plan may be inspected.\n\n(3) The said declaration shall be conclusive evidence that the\nland is needed for a public purpose or for a company, as the\ncase may be; and, after making such declaration, the\nappropriate Government may acquire the land in manner\nhereinafter appearing.\n\n11A. Period within which an award shall be made.- (1) The\nCollector shall make an award under section 11 within a\nperiod of two years from the date of the publication of the\ndeclaration and if no award is made within that period, the\nentire proceeding for the acquisition of the land shall lapse:\n\nProvided that in a case where the said declaration has been\npublished before the commencement of the Land Acquisition\n(Amendment) Act, 1984, the award shall be made within a\nperiod of two years from such commencement.\n\nExplanation - In computing the period of two years referred\nto in this section, the period during which any action or\nproceeding to be taken in pursuance of the said declaration\nis stayed by an order of a Court shall be excluded.\"\n\n\n\n\n \n11) These provisions were considered by this Court in\n\nvarious decisions.       In Krishi Utpadan Mandi Samiti\n\nand Another vs. Makrand Singh and Others, (1995) 2\n\nSCC 497, the question that was posed for consideration\n\nwas whether the High Court was right in its conclusion\n\nthat the declaration under Section 6 was published after\n\nthree years and the last of the publications shall be the\n\nlast date for the purpose of computing three years&apos; period\n\nenvisaged in clause (i) of the proviso to sub-section (1) of\n\nSection 6 of the Act as amended by Land Acquisition\n\n(Amendment) Act, 1984. The discussion and conclusion\n\nin paras 4 and 5 are relevant:\n\n     \"4. The question, therefore, is that which date of the\n     publications in three steps i.e. publication in the Gazette,\n     two newspapers and local publication to be the last date for\n     the purpose of computing three years&apos; limitation prescribed\n     in clause (i) of the proviso to Section 6(1) of the Act. Prima\n     facie, it gives an impression that the last of any of the three\n     steps puts in motion, the running of limitation of three\n     years. But on deeper probe, it does not appear to be so and\n     such a construction would easily defeat the public purpose\n     and deflects the course of justice. So it is necessary to\n     understand the scheme and policy of the Act to get the crux\n     of the question. It is seen that sub-section (1) of Section 4\n     gives power of eminent domain to the State to acquire the\n     land, whenever it appears to it that the land is needed or\n     likely to be needed for any public purpose or for any\n     company, by a notification published in the Official Gazette\n\n\n \nand two daily newspapers circulating in that area and at\nleast one of them should be in the regional language and\nalso the Collector is enjoined to cause public notice of the\nsubstance of notification to be given at convenient places in\nthe said locality in which the land is situated. It is also\nmentioned thereunder that the last date of such publication\nand the giving of such public notice \"being hereinafter\nreferred to\" as the date of publication of the notification. It\nwould be seen that the purpose of notification under Section\n4(1) is an intimation to the owner or person having an\ninterest in the land that Government exercised the power of\neminent domain in relation to his land and for public\npurpose his land is needed or likely to be needed; puts an\nembargo on his freedom to deal with the land as an\nunencumbered land and also pegs the price of the land\nprevailing as on that date. It also is a caveat to the Collector\nto make the award under Section 11 as well as to determine\nthe market value prevailing as on the last of the dates to be\nthe date and the award should be made within a period\nprescribed by Section 11-A, lest the entire acquisition shall\nstand lapsed. The word `hereinafter&apos; is for such purposes as\nwell as for the purpose of determination of the compensation\nunder Chapter III of the Act as well. Therefore, the word\n`hereinafter&apos; referred to as the last date of the publication of\nthe notification is the date from which the prevailing prices\nof the land is to be computed etc.\n\n\n5. Clause (i) of the proviso to Section 6(1) mandates the\npublication of the declaration in the Official Gazette and it\nshould be within three years from the date of the publication\nof the notification under Section 4(1) i.e. the last of the dates\nreferred to in Section 4(1). The word `publish&apos; emphasises the\nact accomplished i.e. declaration under Section 6(1) being\npublished in the Official Gazette. The last date under Section\n6(2) shall be the date for the purposes \"hereinafter referred\nto\" would be not for computing the period of three years\nprescribed in clause (i) of proviso to Section 6(1) of the Act as\nit was already done, but purposes to be followed hereinafter.\nOtherwise language would have been \"hereinbefore done\".\nSub-section (2) as such did not prescribe any limitation\nwithin which the declaration under Section 6(1) or other\nsteps hereinafter to be taken, in other words, the steps to be\ntaken thereafter in making the award under Section 11 or in\ncomputation of the period prescribed in Section 11-A. The\npublication of the declaration in two daily newspapers\nhaving circulation in the locality one of which is in the\nregional language and the publication of the substance of\n\n\n \n    the declaration in the locality are ministerial acts and is a\n    procedural part. It appears that these publications are\n    required to be done to make the declaration published in the\n    manner, to be conclusive evidence of the public purpose\n    under Section 6(1) and also to provide limitation to make the\n    award under Section 11 by the Collector. In other words, the\n    limitation prescribed under Section 11-A is for the purpose\n    of making the award and if the Collector fails to do so, the\n    entire proceeds under Sections 4(1) and 6(1) shall stand\n    lapsed. If this consistent policy of the Act is understood\n    giving teeth to the operational efficacy to the scheme of the\n    Act and public purpose the Act seeks to serve, we are of the\n    considered view that publication in the Official Gazette\n    already made under clause (i) of proviso to sub-section (1) of\n    Section 6 is complete, as soon as the declaration under\n    Section 6(1) was published in the Official Gazette. That will\n    be the date for the purpose of computation of three years&apos;\n    period from the last of the dates of the publication of the\n    notification under Section 4(1). The procedural ministerial\n    acts prescribed under sub-section (2) are only for the\n    purpose of the procedure to be followed `hereinafter&apos;, in other\n    words, the steps to be taken subsequent to the publication of\n    the declaration under Section 6(1) of t Property - Validity of securing procedures - Sections 4, 5A, 6, 6 and 11A Land Acquisition Act, 1894 - Acquisition procedures were started under the Land Acquisition Act for development of a school on the land under the Surat Municipal Corporation - Appellants the proprietors, tested the obtaining on grounds procurement not done according to arrangements set down under the Act and honor was not made inside two years from the date of last production of Notification under Section 6 subsequently, the obtaining is vitiated - High Court rejected the request of favored by the Appellants - Hence exhibit Appeal — Whether High court was supported in expelling the appeal to favored by the Appellants - Held, notice under Section 4 in the Official Gazette was distributed, open notice was shown at the workplace of Mamlatdar of the concerned Ward and knowing about protests under Section 5A was additionally settled and the Appellants were given a few open doors for hearing their complaints now and again — Notification under Section 6 was keep going distributed on nineteenth April, 1990 and in this manner the time of two years stipulated in Section 11A would start to keep running from nineteenth April, 1990 and, along these lines, the distribution of the Award under Section 11 of the Act on eighteenth April, 1992 was inside the stipulated time point of confinement of two years - Land being referred to kept under booking for school in the endorsed improvement anticipate the State Government under Section 17 of the Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Act, it is the obligation of the Corporation to gain the land for actualizing the arrangements of the same - No Interference with the Order of High court - Appeal expelled \r\n\r\nProperty - \"Need\" and \"need\" - Appellant fought that in perspective of presence of many schools in and around the region, there is no compelling reason to build up a school in the place that is known for the Appellants - Held, In regard of \"need\" and \"need\", it is for the Government and their specialists to take a choice considering different angles - If such a choice is taken in view of materials it is not for the Court to question their case - Appeal expelled ','Arjun Singh Vs State Of H.P Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.\n\n\n\n\n1.

He\nwas sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 7 years, 3 years, 4\n\nyears, 5 years and 7 years for the aforesaid offences alongwith fine with\n\ndefault stipulation.\n\n\n\n3.    Prosecution version as unfolded during trial is as follows:\n\n\n\n      On 18.7.1999, the victim (PW10) boarded the bus to Shimla from\n\nSolan. When the bus bearing registration No. HP-12-4113 reached near\n\npetrol pump (HIMFED) situated near Nav Bahar towards Chotta Shimla, all\n\nthe passengers got down, except the prosecutrix and accused-appellant\n\nArjun Singh. Accused Arjun Singh committed forcible sexual intercourse\n\nwith the prosecutrix against her will and without her consent. The victim\n\nwas kidnapped by the accused who was minor at the time of kidnapping in\n\nbus No.HP-12-4113 from Solan. The accused had induced the prosecutrix\n\nthat he would marry her after reaching Nalagarh. The FIR was registered.\n\nThereafter the investigation was carried out and the challan was put in the\n\nCourt. The appellant was charged for offences punishable under Sections\n\n376, 511, 366 and 109 of the Indian Penal Code. The prosecution examined\n\n15 witnesses to prove its case. The appellant had examined Shri Arvind\n\nSharma (DW 1) as defence witness. The learned Additional Sessions Judge,\n\n\n\n \nSolan, convicted and sentenced the accused as stated above. The sentences\n\nwere directed to run concurrently. It is to be noted that two persons faced\n\ntrial for the aforesaid offences i.e. appellant who was the conductor of the\n\nvehicle, and one Daler Singh who was the driver of the vehicle. Since\n\naccused persons abjured guilt, trial was held. The trial court placed reliance\n\non the evidence of the prosecutrix (PW1) and her mother (PW 3). As a plea\n\nrelating to the age of the prosecutrix to show that she was a consenting party\n\nwas taken, the person who had issued the date of birth certificate was\n\nexamined as PW 4. According to the said certificate the date of birth was\n\n19th October, 1984. She was admitted to the school on 1st April, 1997 and\n\nhad left it on 24th October, 1998. The trial Court held that the age of the\n\nvictim was less than 16 years and placed reliance on the documents\n\nproduced. It was also submitted by the accused persons that no rape has\n\nbeen committed. This plea also was rejected by the trial court.\n\n\n\n      Accordingly the trial court while holding the appellant guilty,\n\nacquitted co-accused. As noted above, appeal before the High Court was\n\ndismissed.\n\n\n\n\n \n4.    In support of the appeal the stand taken before the trial court and the\n\nHigh Court were reiterated.\n\n\n\n5.    Learned counsel for the respondent-State supported the judgment of\n\nthe High Court.\n\n\n\n6.    So far as the age aspect is concerned in Vishnu v. State of\n\nMaharashtra [2006(1) SCC 283] it was inter alia held as follows:\n\n\n                \"20. It is urged before us by Mr Lalit that the\n             determination of the age of the prosecutrix by\n             conducting ossification test is scientifically proved and,\n             therefore, the opinion of the doctor that the girl was of\n             18-19 years of age should be accepted. We are unable to\n             accept this contention for the reasons that the expert\n             medical evidence is not binding on the ocular evidence.\n             The opinion of the Medical Officer is to assist the court\n             as he is not a witness of fact and the evidence given by\n             the Medical Officer is really of an advisory character and\n             not binding on the witness of fact.\"\n\n\n\n\n7.    In State of Chhattisgarh v. Lekhram [2006(5) SCC 736] it was held\n\nthat the register maintained in a school is admissible evidence to prove the\n\ndate of birth of the person concerned in terms of Section 35 of the Indian\n\nEvidence Act, 1872 (in short `Evidence Act&apos;). It may be true that in the\n\nentry of the school register is not conclusive but it has evidentiary value.\n\n \n8.    Learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that the evidence of\n\nthe Doctor clearly rules out the commission of rape. The Medical officer\n\n(PW 9) has stated that rape had not been committed and sexual intercourse\n\nhad not taken place.\n\n\n\n9.    The offence of rape occurs in Chapter XVI of IPC. It is an offence\n\naffecting the human body. In that Chapter, there is a separate heading for\n\n`Sexual offence&apos;, which encompasses Sections 375, 376, 376-A, 376-B,\n\n376-C, and 376-D. `Rape&apos; is defined in Section 375. Sections 375 and 376\n\nhave been substantially changed by Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1983,\n\nand several new sections were introduced by the new Act, i.e. 376-A, 376-\n\nB, 376-C and 376-D. The fact that sweeping changes were introduced\n\nreflects the legislative intent to curb with iron hand, the offence of rape\n\nwhich affects the dignity of a woman. The offence of rape in its simplest\n\nterm is `the ravishment of a woman, without her consent, by force, fear or\n\nfraud&apos;, or as `the carnal knowledge of a woman by force against her will&apos;.\n\n`Rape&apos; or `Raptus&apos; is when a man hath carnal knowledge of a w (1) Indian Penal Code, 1860 - Sections 376, 511, 365, 366 and 109- - Rape, and so forth.- - Conviction and sentence - Whether subject to obstruction?- - Held, \"halfway\"- - Rape does not seem to have been conferred - But rather endeavor to submit assault - Clearly settled - Hence, offense under Section 376 not made out- - But rather that under Section 511 obviously made out- - In foundation of certainties of case, Section 109 has no application - Appellant properly indicted and sentenced for offenses under Sections 365, 366 and 511- - But his conviction under Sections 109 and 376 unsustainable- - But put aside. \r\n\r\n(2) Evidence Act, 1872- - Sections 3 and 9- - Appreciation of proof - Evidence of therapeutic officer on age- - Really of counseling character- - And not official on observer of actuality. ','Karnataka Industrial Areas Vs Nandi Cold Storage Pvt. Ltd J U D G M E N T I.A. NO.1 IN CIVIL APPEAL NO. 5542 OF 2004 Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.\r\n\r\n1. Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission at New Delhi (in short the &#39;National Commission&#39;). Respondent had filed a complaint against the appellant before the National Commission.\r\n\r\n2. Background facts in a nutshell are as follows:\r\n\r\n3. In the complaint respondent inter alia stated as follows:\r\n\r\nThe complainant company, desirous of opening a cold storage unit in the State of Karnataka, applied for allotment of land to the appellant in August 1991. After meeting all the formalities required from time to time by the appellant, a plot bearing No.2 of Chickballapur Industrial Area, measuring 2.5 acre of land, was allotted for setting up a cold storage. Possession certificate was issued on 26/30.8.93. The complainant also in the meantime obtained a loan of Rs.67 lakh from the Karnataka State Financial Corporation (in short &#39;KFC&#39;). For the first time in August 1994, a letter was written by appellant to the complainant that &quot;the company could not go ahead with construction activity on the plot allotted as the erstwhile land owner of plot No.2 covered in Sy.No.29 and 30 of Jadalathimmanahally Village has obtained stay order from the High Court of Karnataka in W.P.No.70/88 challenging the acquisition proceedings. The Board initiated action for vacating the stay order granted by the High Court of Karnataka. However, the company could not go ahead with implementation in view of the stay order granted by the High Court. The complainant sought for permission to go ahead with implementation after the litigation in respect of the above land is disposed of by the High Court. The Board should also grant extension of time to the company for implementation of the project after disposal of the litigation.\r\n\r\n4. Original land holder took back possession forcibly in view of the order of the Karnataka High Court. The writ petition filed by the original land holder was allowed by the High Court leaving the complainant high and dry without land, more so when in September 1994, the KFC cancelled the term loan in view of the fact that no progress was made in the implementation of the project. Since the complainant was keen to go ahead with the project, on collecting some information, it approached the appellant to allot plot No.1-A and 1-B which was lying vacant, which were allotted to the complainant in 1995. But it seems that bad luck had not stopped chasing the complainant. As soon as the allotment in respect of plot no.1- A and 1-B were made on a resumed plot, the original allottees moved the High Court making the complainant a party before it. However, after protracted litigation, the writ petition was dismissed but in the meanwhile the loans had been cancelled and the complain Consumer Protection Act, 1986 - Sections 2 (1) (g) and 21- - Deficiency in administration - Allotment of plot for setting up mechanical units- - About insufficiency in administration, adjust approach received by National Commission - However, remuneration conceded is on higher side- - Hence, decreased to Rs. one lakh from Rs. three lakhs.\r\n NA'), 'idx_court_decisions_0', '', 5 AS around, 300 AS limit)";i:1;i:96;i:2;s:21:"yii\db\Command::query";i:3;d:1579264315.080543;i:4;a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"file";s:68:"C:\xampp\htdocs\legal_mix\common\models\JudgmentMastSphinxSearch.php";s:4:"line";i:231;s:8:"function";s:8:"queryAll";s:5:"class";s:14:"yii\db\Command";s:4:"type";s:2:"->";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"file";s:65:"C:\xampp\htdocs\legal_mix\frontend\controllers\SiteController.php";s:4:"line";i:862;s:8:"function";s:16:"searchJudgements";s:5:"class";s:38:"common\models\JudgmentMastSphinxSearch";s:4:"type";s:2:"->";}}i:5;i:9855648;}}}";s:2:"db";s:532054:"a:1:{s:8:"messages";a:22:{i:7;a:6:{i:0;s:29:"SHOW FULL COLUMNS FROM `user`";i:1;i:80;i:2;s:21:"yii\db\Command::query";i:3;d:1579264301.312756;i:4;a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"file";s:48:"C:\xampp\htdocs\legal_mix\common\models\User.php";s:4:"line";i:65;s:8:"function";s:7:"findOne";s:5:"class";s:23:"yii\db\BaseActiveRecord";s:4:"type";s:2:"::";}}i:5;i:4875448;}i:8;a:6:{i:0;s:29:"SHOW FULL COLUMNS FROM `user`";i:1;i:96;i:2;s:21:"yii\db\Command::query";i:3;d:1579264301.313756;i:4;a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"file";s:48:"C:\xampp\htdocs\legal_mix\common\models\User.php";s:4:"line";i:65;s:8:"function";s:7:"findOne";s:5:"class";s:23:"yii\db\BaseActiveRecord";s:4:"type";s:2:"::";}}i:5;i:4889992;}i:10;a:6:{i:0;s:595:"SELECT

MOHAPATRA,J This appeal, filed by accused no.1 Babu Kuttan Ramkrishna Pillai and accused no.2 Umesh @ Babu Purshottam Bhatt of TADA ACT Spl.Case No.33 of 1994, is directed against the judgment and order dated 21.8.1998 of the Designated Court at Brihan `Mumbai under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 (for short TADA Act). In the said case seven accused persons faced trial under Section 120-B read with 307 r/w 34, 307 r/w 114, 307 r/w 149, 387 r/w 34, 143, 144, 147, 148 and 506 (ii), 353 r/w 114 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 3(2)(ii), 3(3), 3(5), 5 and 6 of the TADA Act and section r/w 25(IB)\r\n\r\n(a), Section 5 r/w 27 of the Arms Act. The gist of the prosecution case relevant for the purpose of this proceeding may be stated thus: With the growth of industry, commerce and trade in and around the city of Mumbai which generates substantial quantity of wealth, there has been increase of organised activities by gangs of anti-socials to extract money from affluent sections of society like developers, hoteliers and other businessmen by putting them in fear of death and then to demand substantial sums of money commonly known as &quot;Khadani&quot; i.e. protection money. One such gang was operating in the city under Amar Naik @ Bhai, who died a couple of years before the decision in the case at an encounter with the police. The prosecution alleged that in pursuance of a criminal conspiracy between 15.1.1994 to 16.5.1994 the accused persons and others of the gang embarked upon preparatory acts like procuring the information about the names of the builders of M/s Kalpataru Construction Company which was engaged in developing a property at Pali Hill, named Nakshatra Building. PW-7 Sudhir Tambe was the Senior Vice-President of the company with its head office at Nariman Point. He used to sit in the head- office. PW 6 Pachapur, Civil Engineer, was an employee of the company who used to remain at the site to supervise the construction. As the prosecution story runs, on 15.4.1994 between 11.30 a.m. and 12.00 noon while PW 6 was on duty at the construction site, accused no.3, Nitin Vasant Venugurlekar armed with revolver and accused No.4 Rajindera @ Rajan Mahadeo Margaj armed with a chopper and accused no.5 Jayendra @ Jai Anandrao Jadhav also armed with a chopper visited the site of Nakshatra Building; they threatened the workers at the site, forcibly brought PW 6 Pachapur in a room on the ground floor and man-handled him. Accused no.3, pointing a revolver at him demanded the name, address and telephone number of the builders. PW 6 disclosed the name of PW 7 Tambe and gave his telephone number to them. The accused then asked him to go to the office of the builders at Nariman Point and make the arrangement for a telephonic talk with Tambe. PW 6 rushed to the office and told Tambe of what had happened at the construction site. This was followed by telephonic calls from the accused who wanted to speak to Tambe. Attempts were made by PW 6 and PW 7 to avoid any discussion with the gangsters. Two or three days thereafter when the accused got Tambe on the telephone he (Tambe) gave them some other telephone numbers and asked them to contact those persons including one D.N.Ghosh, the Security Contractor. Eight/ten days thereafter again a telephone call was made to the office of Tambe which was received by PW 6 who was informed by the person making the call that they could not get D. N. Ghosh on the telephone numbers furnished by Tambe. Thereafter PW 6 handed over the receiver to Tambe. This incident was followed by several threats given by the gangsters to workers and also repeated telephone calls made to the Head Office of the company to contact Tambe. The staff of the site office absented from work resulting in virtual closure of construction activity. On 11.5.1994 the deceased Sanjay Patil telephoned to Tambe and warned him that he is wasting time and should meet him without further delay. After some days there was one more similar call from Sanjay Patil and he asked Tambe that he should talk to Bhai and saying so he handed over the receiver to another person who gave his identity as Amar Naik (since deceased), who told Tambe that he should pay Rs.10 lacs. The later pleaded his inability to pay such a heavy sum and after some discussion agreed to pay Rs.5 lacs. He was asked to come to Nakshatra Building site on 16.5.1994 along with money. In the meantime Tambe informed all the happenings to the Addl. Commissioner of Police Mr.Sanjeev Dayal and the then Dy. Commissioner of Police of Zone VII Mr. Rajanish Sheth within whose jurisdiction Khar Police Station fell.\r\n\r\nOn 16.5.1994 at about 12.00 noon the deceased Sanjay Patil telephoned Tambe and inquired from him as to what he was going to do about the payment and then Tambe replied that he will be leaving office at about 2.00 p.m. for Pali Hill. Sanjay Patil cautioned him that he should not make any haste and he should wait for his call so that he will take necessary instructions from his boss i.e. Amar Naik. At about 2.00 p.m. on that day there was a telephone call from Sanjay Patil telling that Tambe should not meet him at the Nakshatra Building site but instead he should meet him near the Ceaser Palace Hotel. This telephonic conversation was tape-recorded. Tambe was instructed on telephone that his man shall carry a white plastic bag containing the amount of Rs.5 lacs and shall wait near the entrance gate of Ceaser\r\n Indian Penal Code Section 120-B r/w 307, 34 likewise 307, r/w 114, 149 and 387 r/w 34, 143, 144, 147, 148 and 506(ii), 353 r/w 114 - Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 `TADA Act&#39; 25(IB)(a) - the Arms Act Section 5, 27 - Indian Penal Code, Section 120-B and 395 considered as saw - charged sentenced detainment for a long time - We do not find that the appreciation of evidence made by the learned trial Judge suffers from any illegality nor can findings recorded by him be said to be perverse- Appeal rejected.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n Appeal Dismissed','Jullundur Improvement Trust Vs Mohan Singh (Dead) By L.Rs. And Ors ORDER\r\n\r\n1. The respondents are the legal representatives of the deceased respondent..\r\n\r\n2. The Jullundur Improvement Trust was established and constituted under the Punjab Town Improvement Trust, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Improvement Trust&quot;). One of the duties and functions assigned to the trust is to frame development schemes for benefit of public. The improvement trust framed scheme known as &quot;development scheme&quot; for providing land to public within the municipal limits of Jullundur city. On 4.1.1970, the Trust resolved that the employees and trustees of the Jullundur Improvement Trust shall be granted residential accommodation on &quot;no profit no loss&quot; basis under the aforesaid scheme. It is not disputed that the plaintiff-respondent herein was one of the trustees of the improvement trust. On 22.1.1971, the plaintiff-respondent submitted an application for allotment of residential plot. While the said application was pending, the government 6y order dated 27.1.1971, directed that no trustee shall be allotted any plot of land in the development scheme formulated by the Improvement Trust at a reserved price. Despite that order of the state government, the trust by resolution dated 24.2.1971, resolved to allot a residential plot to the plaintiff-respondent subject to the approval of the state government. On 31.8.1971, a provisional letter of allotment of land was issued to the plaintiff-respondent. In pursuance thereof, it is alleged that the respondent deposited the price of the land. When the aforesaid fact came to the notice of the government, the government by letter dated 5.9.1972 called upon the improvement trust to show cause under what circumstances, the provisional allotment has been made in favour of the plaintiff-respondent. It is not disputed that the said scheme was subsequently not approved by the state government and it fell through. Under these circumstances, the plaintiff-respondent filed a suit for permanent injunction restraining the appellant herein from committing the breach of the alleged agreement and from cancelling the provisional allotment made i\r\n Trust and Societies - Contract - Specific help - Injunction - Improvement trust confined advancement conspire for giving area to open inside the civil furthest reaches of city - Employees and trustees to get convenience on no benefit no misfortune&quot; premise under the plan - Despite request of the state government that no trustee should be allocated any plot of land at a saved value, a determination gone by trust in which the offended party respondent partook and got a distribution of land - Scheme is no longer a subsisting plan as not endorsed by state Govt. - No closing contract has appeared between the litigant trust and the respondent - Relief of changeless directive looked for in the suit couldn&#39;t have been allowed by the trial court and insisted by the High Court - Sections 38, 39 and 41 of Specific Relief Act, 1963.\r\n Appeal Dismissed With Cost','Dasrath vs State Of M.P on 29 July, 2010 V.S. SIRPURKAR, J.\r\n\r\n1. The present appeal is directed against the judgment of the High Court dismissing the appeal of the appellant Dasrath. He was convicted by the Trial Court of the offence under Section 304B,&nbsp;Indian Penal Code&nbsp;(IPC) and was sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and pay a fine of Rs. 5,000/- and in default directed to suffer further imprisonment for one year. He was also convicted for the offence under&nbsp;Section 201,&nbsp;IPC&nbsp;and was directed to suffer rigorous imprisonment for one&nbsp;year with a fine of Rs.1,000/- and in default to suffer three month&#39;s further imprisonment.\r\n\r\n2. Initially, as many as three accused persons came to be tried by the Sessions Judge, they being accused No.1, Kalyan, accused No.2, Dasrath and accused No.3, Smt. Usha. While accused No.2, Dasrath is the present appellant, accused No.1, Kalyan Singh and accused No.3, Smt. Usha are his father and sister, respectively. The Trial Court had also convicted Kalyan Singh for the same offence. However, it acquitted accused No.3, Smt. Usha from all the charges. Both the accused had filed an appeal challenging their conviction and the sentences before the High Court. However, during the pendency of the appeal, accused No.1 Kalyan Singh expired and his appeal, thus, abated. The appeal of Dasrath, the present appellant came to be dismissed by the High Court and that is how he is before us.\r\n\r\n3. Shortly stated, the prosecution story was that Dasrath was married to Pinki who died under suspicious circumstance of burning. An intimation regarding death came to be given to the Police Station Pandhokhar, Distt. Gwalior. The said intimation was given by the complainant Vadehi Saran s/o Ramanand Kaurav who was none else but the father of the deceased Pinki. It was, inter alia, stated that on that day i.e. 12.8.1992 in the morning his son Jitendra Singh had gone to village Saujna for Rakhi&nbsp;festival to his daughter Pinki&#39;s house. But he returned at about 7 p.m. and told him that Pinki had caught fire and was sent to Daboh for treatment. Vadehi Saran further stated that on hearing the news, he along with some co-villagers went to Daboh. However, one Santosh belonging to his village met him near Dugdha Dairy and told him that Pinki had died. Then Vadehi Saran along with others went to village Saujna. But by the time they reached there, Pinki&#39;s cremation was over. It was because of this that they came to the Police Station and further action was requested on the basis of the death report.\r\n\r\n4. On this basis, a First Information Report was got registered on 16.8.92 wherein it was recorded that the death intimation was given on 12.8.92 at 23.15 hours orally about the death of Pinki. It was recorded on a preliminary inquiry made by Head Constable Jaswir Singh by visiting village Saujna and the Station House Officer R.S. Purohit had also made inquiries relating to the death. The place of occurrence was examined by SDOP R.K. Hirodia and inquiry was made from the deceased&#39;s father Vadehi Saran, uncle Uttam Singh, brothers Janved Singh and Jitendra Singh, mother Vidya Devi and sister Pratibha. During this inquiry, it was found that the deceased was married 2 years prior to the date of incident and because of the non-payment of dowry, her husband Dasrath, father-in- law Kalyan Singh and Sister-in-law Usha were harassing her. The earlier&nbsp;statement given by Vadehi Saran was repeated. It was then mentioned that on 12.8.1992 the sister-in-law Usha, husband Dasrath caught hold of Pinki and father-in-law Kalyan Singh poured kerosene oil on her and set her on fire because of which she got burnt. The accused thereafter cremated her and cleaned the place where occurrence had taken place.\r\n\r\n5. On the basis of this, further investigation ensued and after its completion, a charge-sheet came to be filed in the Court for offences under&nbsp;Sections 302,&nbsp;304&nbsp;B and 201&nbsp;IPC. The accused were charged accordingly. The prosecution, during the trial, examined as many as 11 witnesses. The accused persons abjured the guilt and as stated earlier only two of them came to be convicted, namely, Kalyan Singh and Dasrath. However, due to the death of Kalyan Singh during the pendency of the appeal, the appeal filed by Dasrath alone is to be considered.\r\n\r\n6. Learned Senior Counsel, Dr. J.N. Singh appearing on behalf of the accused attacked the judgment of both the Courts below, firstly, contending that conviction under&nbsp;Section 304B,&nbsp;IPC&nbsp;and Section, 201,&nbsp;IPC&nbsp;was wholly incorrect as it was not proved that Pinki had died a suspicious or un-natural death within the seven years of her marriage nor was her body found. He also contended that there was no question of demanding any dowry as no complaint was ever made for dowry nor was there any evidence regarding the demands of dowry. Lastly, he suggested that there&nbsp;was no question of any offence having been committed. He pointed out that the Trial Court had acquitted all the accused of the offence under&nbsp;Section 302,&nbsp;IPC&nbsp;though a charge was also framed under that Section and there was no appeal by the State Government against the acquittal under&nbsp;Section 302,&nbsp;IPC. Under such circumstances, it was clear that the accused persons could not be held responsible for the death of Pinki.\r\n\r\n7. As against this, Ms. Aishwarya Bhati, Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent pointed out that it could not be said that the death did not take place within seven years of marriage as the accused himself had admitted that the marriage had taken place six years prior to the trial. She further pointed out that there was a clear assertion made by the witnesses in their evidence. More particularly, Vadehi Saran (PW 4), Janved Singh (PW-5), Pratibha (PW-6) and Jitendra Singh (PW-8) had clearly asserted that the dowry was asked for by the accused persons. Learned Counsel further contended that if Pinki had died of burning, a report ought to have been made for un-natural death which the accused did not bother to make, instead they had cremated the body of Pinki without even intimating the relatives of the deceased and also without waiting for the police. This was the most suspicious circumstance which pointed towards the guilt of the accused.\r\n\r\n8. It is on the basis of these rival versions that it is to be seen as to whether the appellant Dasrath was rightly convicted for the offence.\r\n\r\n9. The first contention raised by the Learned Counsel for the defence regarding the corpus delicti not being found was countered by Ms. Bhati by saying that there can be no dispute about the death of Pinki. It is not the defence of the accused that Pinki was still living. On the other hand, the accused persons admittedly had cremated her body on the fateful day. Therefore, this is not a case, according to her, of corpus delicti not being found and, therefore, there being a serious suspicion about the death having taken place at all. The question is, in the absence of corpus delicti, could it be presumed that the accused persons alone were responsible for the death of Pinki. We must hasten to add here that the accused persons have already been acquitted of the murder charge. What remains to be seen is as to whether Pinki died an un-natural death within seven years of her marriage and whether her death was attributable to the demand of dowry and further whether she was dealt with cruelly soon before her death. If these ingredients are proved by the prosecution then the conviction of the accused under&nbsp;Section 304B,&nbsp;IPC&nbsp;will be complete.\r\n\r\n10. There can be no dispute that Pinki had died an un-natural death. In fact there is enough evidence to suggest that Pinki suffered the burn injuries. It is not the defence of the accused that she died a natural death.&nbsp;Both the Courts have very specifically held that Pinki suffered burn injuries and died because of the same. In fact Jitendra Singh (PW-8) was specific in his evidence that Pinki was burning on account of the kerosene having been poured on her body. In fact it is apparent from his cross-examination that when Pinki shouted, neighbours rushed to her house. There can be no dispute that this witness has been dis-believed and rightly so, insofar as his evidence about the accused deliberately burning Pinki is concerned. However, there can be no dispute that Pinki was burnt and it was clear that she had died an un-natural death. Again, it is clear from the report of the chemical analyzer that the kerosene residues were found from Packet-A which contained the clothes of Pinki which were seized during the investigation. Therefore, it is clear that Pinki&#39;s death was caused because of the burns and not in the normal circumstances. The finding of the Trial Court and the appellate Court in that behalf is correct. For this reason we are not impressed by the argument of the Learned Counsel that in the absence of corpus delicti, the conviction could not stand. Similarly, there can be no dispute that Pinki died within seven years of her marriage. Gandharv Singh (PW-1) had specifically asserted that the marriage was performed 3-4 years prior to the incident. Though this witness was declared hostile, at least the fact that marriage had taken place 3-4 years prior to the incident can be safely accepted. According to PW-2, Bhagwati Saran also the marriage had taken place within 5-6 years prior to trial.&nbsp;Again even this witness was declared hostile. However, that claim remained un-controverted. Third witness PW-3, Hari Saran asserted that the marriage was performed 6-7 years earlier to the date of his evidence. His evidence was in May, 1997 and even taking that the marriage took place somewhere in the year 1990, it would still be within seven years. Vadehi Saran, the father also said that the marriage had taken place 6-7 years prior to the date of his evidence which was again 30.09.1997. Therefore, according to his evidence even if the marriage could date back to the year 1987, it would still put the death of Pinki within seven years of her marriage.\r\n\r\n11. Therefore, it is certain that Pinki died an un-natural death by burning within seven years of her marriage. As regards dowry, Learned Counsel for the defence pointed out that there was no specific evidence nor was any allegation made in the First Information Report. We are not much impressed as we have seen from the evidence that there were demands of Buffalo made to Vadehi Saran, father of Pinki who did not accept that demand. Vadehi Saran has also specifically stated in his evidence that after 1 = years of the marriage when he went to the house of Pinki in the month of Shravan, door was closed and the appellants were beating Pinki and that the floor was smeared with blood and blood was also oozing out from the mouth of Pinki. He also asserted about the demand of a large&nbsp;size television as the television which was given in marriage was a small colour television. This evidence of torture is well supported by the evidence of Pratibha (PW-6), Anant Ram Singh (PW-7) and Uttam Singh (PW-9). In view of this, the Trial court and the appellate Court have recorded that, firstly, Pinki died an un-natural death because of burning within seven years of her marriage and, secondly concluded that she was subjected to cruelty and harassment by her husband and/or relatives in connection with the demand for dowry and that she was subjected to cruelty soon before her death.\r\n\r\n12. Similar is the case as regards the offence under&nbsp;Section 201,&nbsp;IPC. In fact it was incumbent upon the accused persons to firstly, inform the police about the un-natural death of Pinki. They did not do so. On the other hand, even after her death, they did not inform either the police or even the relatives like her father etc., though they could have done so. In stead they hurriedly conducted the funeral thereby causing destruction of evidence.\r\n\r\n13.&nbsp;In State of Rajasthan v. Jaggu Ram&nbsp;[2008 (12) SCC 51], this Court has considered the circumstance about the non-information to the parents and the hurried cremation. This was also a case where accused persons were tried for offence under&nbsp;Section 304B,&nbsp;IPC, where the accused, after the death of the unfortunate lady did not bother to inform her parents. In&nbsp;paragraph 26, this Court took a serious note of the manner in which the body was disposed of. The Court observed &quot;the disposal of the dead body in a hush-hush manner clearly establishes that the accused had done so with the sole object of concealing the real cause of death of Shanti @ Gokul.&quot;\r\n\r\n14. In that case, the funeral was conducted in the wee hours. In this case, funeral was conducted in the evening.\r\n\r\n15. From all this, it is clear that the prosecution has not only proved the offence under&nbsp;Section 304B,&nbsp;IPC&nbsp;with the aid of&nbsp;Section 113B,&nbsp;Indian Evidence Act&nbsp;but also the offence under&nbsp;Section 201,&nbsp;IPC. We are satisfied that all the three ingredients of&nbsp;Section 304B,&nbsp;IPC, they being:\r\n\r\na) that the death of a woman has been caused by burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under normal circumstances;\r\n\r\nb)&nbsp;that such death has been caused or has occurred within seven years of her marriage; and\r\n\r\nc)&nbsp;that soon before her death the woman was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband in connection with any demand for dowry.&quot;\r\n\r\nas also the presumption under&nbsp;Section 113B&nbsp;of India Evidence Act are fully established the case of prosecution.\r\n\r\n16. We have gone through the judgments of the Trial Court as well as the appellate Court carefully and we find that both the Courts have fully considered all the aspects of this matter. We, therefore, find nothing wrong with the judgments and confirm the same. The appeal is, therefore, dismissed.\r\n\r\n.......................................J.\r\n\r\n(V.S.

Officers J U D G M E N T ARUN KUMAR, J.\r\n\r\nThe forest service in the State of Orissa was constituted under the&nbsp;Indian Forest Act, 1927 and the Madras Forest Act, 1882. However, in 1972 the State had its own&nbsp;Forest Act. The primary object of the legislation was protection and management of forests in the State. The words &#39;forest officer&#39; have been defined under the Act to mean persons whom the State Government, or any officer empowered by it in this behalf, may appoint to carry out all or any of the purposes of the Act. A forest officer would include the Principal Chief Conservator of Forest as well as subordinates like Conservator of Forests, Forest Range Officers, Deputy Rangers and Foresters. In the year 1979 the State of Orissa adopted the Antyodaya Programme of the Central Government. Under the said programme Social Forestry Projects were undertaken which envisaged contact with the poorest of poor farmers to educate and train them in matters connected with farming. For purpose of the Social Forestry Projects, ex cadre posts of Forestry Extension Officers (for short &#39;FEOs&#39;) were created by the State Government. These were project related posts and their expenses were met from special funds raised for the project. The project was for specific purpose and for a specific period and was funded by the Central Government. The duration of the project was, however, extended from time to time in order to fulfil its objective.\r\n\r\nThe recruitment for the posts of FEOs was to be made from the open market. The officers were to be given training in raising of seedlings, nursery work etc. so that when they go to the field they could properly motivate and educate the farmers. The minimum qualification prescribed for FEOs was Intermediate with Botany as a subject. After recruitment these officers were to be posted in blocks wherein forestry extension work was undertaken. Certain blocks within the State were selected for such extension work as a part of the Forestry Extension Programme. The FEOs were envisaged as somebody remaining in touch with small farmers at the lowest level in each village block and assessing their requirements of forest species and other species. The respondents were recruited as Forestry Extension Officers under the Project from 1979 onwards. The respondents claim that they should be treated as part of the forest service under the Forest Department of the State Government and the posts held by them should have equal pay and equal status with the equal level posts in the Forest Department. They further claim that the posts held by them should be included in the channel of promotion to higher posts in the forest Department. The grievance of the respondents is that they have been stagnating in the posts of FEOs to which they were recruited nearly twenty years ago. According to them though the project has senior level posts of Social Forestry Supervisors but these posts are being filled by getting officers from forest service of the State Government on deputation, thereby the posts are being denied to them. In the matter of pay scales the grievance of the FEOs is that they are being equated with foresters who are neither as qualified as they are nor the foresters discharge such important functions as they are discharging. The minimum educational qualification prescribed for the post of forester in the quota meant for direct recruits at the relevant time was Matriculation only. The FEOs are trained to motivate people under Social Forestry Projects which requires contact with individual farmers and working at the grass root level. On the other hand, officers of the Forest Department of the State are mainly concerned with protecting forests, including forest property, preventing illegal felling of trees, keeping a check on forest contractors in order to ensure that forest produce is not illegally exploited and removed, prevention of poaching of forest animals etc..\r\n\r\nIn the year 1990, some of the Forest Extension Officers (FEOs) approached the Orrisa Administrative Tribunal for purposes of relief with regard to the above demands. In fact, before approaching the Tribunal they had made representation to the Government which did not yield any result. This Original Application was disposed of by the Orissa Administrative Tribunal vide order dated 7.9.1995. The Tribunal noted that the government was alive to the grievance being aired by the FEOs. It directed the State Government to decide the question of fixation of pay scales of FEOs within six months. The Association of the FEOs was allowed an opportunity to be heard by the officers of the State Government who would be taking such a decision on behalf of the government. The Tribunal further observed that when the question of pay scales would be considered, the question of promotional avenues should also be taken into consideration. It appears that nothing happened in pursuance of the said direction of the Tribunal. The Association of FEOs again approached the Tribunal by way of an application in the year 1996. The main grievance of the Association was that inspite of the FEOs being well qualified, they were being made to stagnate as there were no chances of promotion to higher posts available for them. The other grievance was about not getting appropriate scale of pay. The respondents claim that they should be treated as equivalent to Forest Rangers and the scale of pay and service benefits given to Forest Rangers should be available to them also.\r\n\r\nThe Tribunal noted that the nature of duties performed by FEOs and the Foresters could not be compared because the two were entirely different. Similarly, the method of recruitment and the basic qualifications required for eligibility to the two posts were different. However, the grievance of the FEOs could not be overlooked. Undoubtedly, the FEOs were not getting any chances of promotion nor they were getting the pay scales commensurate to the duties and functions being performed by them. Having regard to these aspects the Tribunal directed that those FEOs who have put in more than ten years of service as FEOs should be treated at par with the post of Deputy Ranger in the state forest service and placed in the same scale of pay which is now applicable to Deputy Rangers. They should also be made eligible for promotion to the posts of Forest Rangers. Those FEOs who have put in less than ten years of service may be treated at par with Foresters and be made eligible for promotion as Deputy Rangers. The Tribunal noted that it was stated in the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the Government in the proceedings before the Tribunal that steps were being taken for movement of the FEOs to other divisions so as to induct them into the mainstream. The Tribunal expected that this movement should start which would result in FEOs with more than ten years of service being posted as Deputy Rangers when they are moved from Social Forestry Section and others should be posted as Foresters. In view of the averments in the counter affidavit the Tribunal recommended to the State Government that the exercise in terms of the above directions should start without further delay so as to equip the FEOs for their induction into the mainstream whenever the Social Forestry Welfare Scheme is abolished. The order of the Tribunal also contained a direction that in future vacancies for Forest Rangers and Deputy Rangers quotas should be earmarked for FEOs with more than ten years of service and FEOs with less than ten years of service respectively. The Tribunal directed the State Government to complete the exercise within four weeks.\r\n\r\nThe State Government issued an order on 19th May, 1998 carrying out the directions contained in the aforesaid judgment of the Orissa Administrative Tribunal. Those Forest Extension Officers who had put in more than ten years of service were to be treated at par with Deputy Rangers and placed in the same pay scale i.e. 1200-30-1560-EB-40-2040. Since out of 105 Forestry Extension Officers, 100 had already completed more than ten years of service as FEOs they were to be declared Senior Grade Forestry Extension Officers and were to be made eligible for promotion to the post of Forest Ranger. Those FEOs who had rendered less than ten years of service were to be treated at par with Foresters. The order contained further details about how the various quotas were to be worked out and postings were to be made.\r\n\r\nOne of the Foresters, under an apprehension that FEOs belonging to the Social Forestry Projects were being merged with the mainstream forest service of the State, approached the State Administrative Tribunal in the year 1998 seeking a declaration that Forestry Extension Officer do not belong to the cadre of the state forest service and that they should not be promoted to the posts of Deputy Rangers. The case of the applicant before the Tribunal was that the Social Forestry Project was a project scheme and the FEOs appointed under that scheme held ex-cadre posts. They were appointed to execute the Project and, therefore, they had nothing to do with regular forest service under the State Government. Since they were holding ex-cadre posts they could not claim promotion to the posts under the cadre. The Tribunal in its order dated 27th January, 1999 found that the apprehension of the petitioner before it was totally misplaced. The Forestry Extension Officers were being given only the pay scales of the equivalent posts in the State Government. Giving equivalent pay scales did not mean that they were being merged with the forest service of the State Government. Similarly regarding their promotions to the posts of Senior Social Forestry Extension Officer, their identity was being kept separate. The equivalence was provided only qua the scales of pay. The Tribunal noted:\r\n\r\n&quot;6. There is nothing in the letter of 19th May, 1998 to show that at any point of time the posts of Social Forestry Extension Officers or Senior Grade Social Forestry Extension Officers on one side and the Deputy Rangers and Foresters on the other have been made interchangeable posts. In order to give incentive to the Extension Officers only a separate channel of promotion has been creatd for them. Neither an Extension Officer can claim a post of Deputy Ranger nor a Forester can claim the post of Senior Grade Forestry Extension Officer.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe Tribunal further observed:\r\n\r\n&quot;7. However, in sub-para (i) of paragraph 1 of the said letter there is an observation that the forestry Extension Officer with more than 10 years of service should be posted as Deputy Ranger when it is proposed to move them out of the Social Forestry Directorate and others having less than ten years of service may be posted as Foresters. We are of the vie that since the government do not intend to make the posts interchangeable, this observation cannot be accepted as reasonable. Until the Extension Officers and Senior Extension Officers are regularly absorbed in the cadre of Foresters and Deputy Rangers and Rangers, they cannot be allowed to hold the posts of Ranger/Deputy Ranger or Forester. We, therefore, advise the State Government to frame a scheme or rules for their absorption in the Forest Department in the event of the abolition of the Directorate of Social Forestry. Until then, the Extension Officers shall not be brought over to the cadre of Foresters and Deputy Rangers. In case the Government desire that the Senior Grade Forest Extension Officer should also have further promotional facility, it is open to the State Government to consider and create appropriate promotional posts for them.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe above order was passed on 27th January, 1999. The State Government filed a Special Leave Petition in this Court challenging the earlier order of the Tribunal dated 5th March, 1997 in the first week of November, 2000 without even making a reference to the subsequent order dated 27th January, 1999. Thus the order dated 27th January, 1999 has not been challenged by any party. Leave to appeal was granted in the Special Leave Petition and the matter was registered as Civil Appeal No.1079 of 2001 which is being disposed of by this order.\r\n\r\nDuring the pendency of this Civil Appeal the Government of Orrisa passed a resolution dated 8th August, 2003 re-organising the field establishments of the Forest and Environment Department under the &#39;Forestry and Wildlife&#39; wing by abolishing the Afforestation and Social Forestry Division and Circles and creating a number of Territorial and Wildlife Divisions and Circles. Further the resolution abolishes certain establishments including the Social Forestry Department. The staff of the Departments which were being abolished was deployed within the remaining establishments. The said resolution provides that the Government had decided to abolish eighteen establishments under the control of Director, Social Forestry Project with which we are concerned in the present case. With the abolition of eighteen establishments of Social Forestry Project, the staff of the establishments is to be deployed in the Divisions/Circles/State Forest Headquarters as per the plan given in the resolution. The resolution came into effect on the date it was issued i.e. 8th August, 2003 and provides that the reorganization exercise was to be completed by 30th September, 2003. The exercise had started and in pursuance thereof a Memo dated 24.10.2003 was issued. None of the parties appearing before us have disputed the said resolution. In fact, an affidavit was filed in the present proceedings on behalf of the respondent Association bringing the said resolution on record. The respondents further stated that in view of the resolution dated 8th August, 2003 the points sought to be raised by the Government in the present appeal were no longer available to it. By the said resolution the members of the respondent-association i.e. Forest Extension Officers (FEOs) who were working under the Social Forestry Projects had been taken into the mainstream i.e. into the Forest Department of the Government of Orissa called the Territorial and Wildlife Division. The Social Forestry Directorate stands abolished. It is a resolution of the State Government. Naturally the learned counsel for the appellant, i.e. the State of Orissa accepts the resolution. In view of these developments the FEOs have ceased to be officers working against a particular project. They have become part of the forest service of the State Government. Their grievances do not survive any more. We have also heard the learned counsel appearing for some of the forest service officers who had intervened in these proceedings. He has tried to canvas that the position of his clients should not be adversely affected due to the merger. As at present he could not spell out any cause for worry for his clients. In any case, in the event of any prejudice being caused to the interveners, they will have independent cause of action for which they are free to pursue their remedies. So far as the State Government is concerned, it is bound by its resolution and, in fact, has taken steps to implement the same. Nothing survives in this appeal. The same is accordingly dismissed as having become infructuous.

In the course of the hearing the respondent claimed that the G.K. Hospital, Building item No. (3) was also exempt from liability to gift-tax because of s. 5 ( 1 ) (xiv) of the Gift-tax. Act. It was the case of the respondent that his son Thomas had graduated in the medical science at an examination held in December 1959 and had joined the respondent&#39;s profession as a House-Surgeon July 1960, and on that account the gifts in respect of items (2) &amp; (3) were exempt from liability to tax. The Gift-tax Officer rejected the claim. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner confirmed the order of the Gift-tax Officer. the Appellate Tribunal held that the respondent was entitled to exemption in respect of items (2) and (3).

In the course of the hearing the respondent claimed that the G.K. Hospital, Building item No. (3) was also exempt from liability to gift-tax because of s. 5 ( 1 ) (xiv) of the Gift-tax. Act. It was the case of the respondent that his son Thomas had graduated in the medical science at an examination held in December 1959 and had joined the respondent&#39;s profession as a House-Surgeon July 1960, and on that account the gifts in respect of items (2) &amp; (3) were exempt from liability to tax. The Gift-tax Officer rejected the claim. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner confirmed the order of the Gift-tax Officer. the Appellate Tribunal held that the respondent was entitled to exemption in respect of items (2) and (3). At the instance of the Commissioner of Gift Tax, the Tribu- nal referred the following question to the High Court of Kerala for opinion &quot;Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the assessee was entitled to the exemption in respect of G.K. Hospital and the adjoining land of 1.38 cents under s. 5 ( 1 )(xiv) of the Gift Tax Act?&quot; The High Court answered the question in the affirmative. The Commissioner of Gift Tax, Kerala, has appealed to this Court. Held: Court is unable to agree with the views so expressed. The donor is exempt under s. 5 (1) (xiv) from liability to pay tax only if the gift is in the course of carrying on a business, pro fession or vocation and is made bona fide for the purpose of such business, profession or vocation. The clause does not enact that a gift made by a person carrying on any business is exempt from tax, nor does it provide that a gift is exempt from tax merely because the property is used for the purpose for which it was used by the donor. Without deciding whether the test of commercial expediency&quot; is strictly appropriate to the claim 3 76 for exemption under S. 5 ( 1 ) (xiv), we are of the view that there is no evidence on the record to prove that the gift to Thomas was &quot;in the course of carrying on the business&quot; of the donor, and &quot;for the purpose of the business&quot;. The appeal is allowed and the order passed by the High Court is set aside. The Commissioner of Gift Tax will get his costs in this Court and the High Court.

The accused persons are the father and brother respectively of the deceased. The incident purportedly took place on 3.1.1990. Though the prosecution relied on the evidence of many persons who supposedly witnessed the occurrence, while deposing in Court, most of them resiled from the statements made during investigation. The version projected by the prosecution was that the deceased was throttled and also poison was administered to him. But the report of the Forensic Science Laboratory stated that the viscera did not contain any poison. The prosecution, therefore, gave up its stand that the deceased was administered poison by the accused persons. There were purportedly some extra-judicial confessions on which the Trial Court relied. Accordingly, the accused persons were convicted for offences punishable under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short &#39;IPC&#39;). In appeal the High Court has, by the impugned judgment, directed acquittal.\r\n\r\nLearned counsel for the appellant-State su\r\n Criminal - Extra legal admission - Section 302 perused with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 - Trial Court sentenced the respondents on the premise of additional legal admissions - In offer High Court cleared the respondents - Hence, introduce request - Held, High Court alluded to the additional legal admissions and found not solid - Witnesses gave shifting rendition about the way in the purported additional legal admissions - Persons who asserted to have seen the occurrence resiled from the announcements made amid examination - No proof to embroil the denounced people - Manipulation done to show report gotten by Magistrate on 3.1.1990 while date of seal found on Exh.

Subhashini for the Respondents.\n     The Judgment of the Court was delivered by\n     RANGANATHAN, J.  The seeds	 of the	 present controversy\nwere sown  as early  as in 1946. It is unfortunate that this\nmatter should  be  coming  up  before  this  Court  for	 its\nconsideration nearly  five decades  later, though it must be\npointed out  that the  issue in	 its  present  form  is	 the\noutcome of an amendment made by the Finance (No.2) Act, 1980\n(hereinafter referred  to as  &apos;the 1980	 Act&apos;) to the Income\nTax Act,  1961* (hereinafter referred to as &apos;the 1961 Act&apos;).\nIt is also a curious co-incidence that the 1980 Act effected\ntwo amendments in the 1961 Act with retrospective effect and\nthe validity  of both  these provisions have been challenged\nbefore the courts. The first was the controversy with regard\nto the	retrospective amendment	 of s.80-J which was settled\nby this	 Court by its decision in Lohia Machines Limited  v.\nUnion of India, (1985) 152 I.T.R. 308 (SC). It is the second\namendment to  the provisions  contained in  section 35(2) of\nthe 1961  Act that has given rise to the present controversy\nbetween the parties.\n     The question  is really  one of  interpretation of	 two\nimportant provisions relating to the computation of business\nincome for  purposes of	 income tax.  We may  start with the\nprovisions of  the Indian  lncome Tax Act, 1922 (hereinafter\nreferred to  as the &apos;1922 Act&apos;). The computation of business\nincome for  purposes of	 income tax  was done  in accordance\nwith the  provisions of	 section 10  of the said Act. In the\nprocess of making such computation, the Act provided for two\nimportant deductions  (among  others),	in  respect  of	 the\ncapital assets	employed in  the business. The first was the\ndeduction under clause (vi) of Section 10(2) of an allowance\nin respect of the depreciation of building, machinery, plant\nor furniture being the property of the assessee and used for\nthe purposes  of the business, at a prescribed percentage of\nthe written  down value	 of such  assets. This	allowance is\ncalculated, in	respect of  the year  of acquisition  of the\nproperty, at a percentage of its actual cost to the assessee\nand in subsequent years at a graduated scale on the basis of\nthe actual  cost less the depreciation allowances granted in\nthe preceding years. In strict principle, this is an\nallowance of  capital nature but it is now well settled that\nthe allowance  of depreciation	has to be taken into account\nin order  to ascertain	the true  profits of a business and,\ntherefore, an  assessee	 is  permitted	to  deduct,  in	 the\ncomputation of	the business  income year  after  year,	 the\nprescribed percentage  of the  value of	 the assets used for\nthe purposes of business. The second allowance was not there\nin the 1922 Act originally and was introduced by the Income-\ntax (Amendment)	 Act, 1946.  The introduction was of certain\nallowances  in	 respect  of   expenditure  on.	 \"scientific\nresearch related  to the  business\", an expression which was\ndefined in  a fairly  comprehensive manner  by the  statute.\nThree types  of allowances were permitted in respect of this\ncategory of  expenditure of which we are here concerned with\nonly one.  This provision  was contained  in clause (xiv) of\nS.10(2) which permitted a deduction.\n     \"in respect of any expenditure of a\n     capital   nature	 on   scientific\n     research related  to the  business,\n     an allowance  for each  of the Five\n     consecutive     previous	   year.\n     beginning	 with the  year in which\n     the expenditure  was  incurred,  or\n     where the	expenditure was incurred\n     prior to  the commencement	 of  the\n     business,	for  each  of  the  five\n     consecutive     previous	   years\n     beginning with  the year  in  which\n     the business  was commenced,  equal\n     2to one-fifth of such expenditure:\n     Provided that no allowance shall be\n     made for  any expenditure	incurred\n     more than	three years  before  the\n     commencement of the business:\n     A Provided further that-\n      XXX   XXX	    XXX\n     (d) where	a deduction  is	 allowed\n     for any  previous year  under  this\n     clause in	respect	 of  expenditure\n     represented wholly or partly by any\n     asset,  no	  deduction   shall   be\n     allowed under clause (vi) or clause\n     (vii) for the same previous year in\n     respect of that asset;\n     (e) where	an asset  is used in the\n     business after it ceases to be used\n     for scientific  research related to\n     that business,  and a  claim for an\n     allowance	under	clause	(vi)  or\n     clause (vii)  is made in respect of\n     that asset,  the actual cost to the\n     assessee  of  the	asset  shall  be\n     treated as reduced by the amount of\n     any deductions  allowed under  this\n     clause;\"\n     A cursory	and conjoint  reading of  section 10(2) (vi)\nand section  10(2) (xiv)  suggests that	 where	an  assessee\nincurs	expenditure   of  a  capital  nature  on  scientific\nresearch related to the business and the expenditure results\nin the	acquisition of	an asset,  the assessee	 can  claim,\nunder clause  (vi), a  deduction of the specified percentage\nof the	written down  value of	the asset   and under clause\n(xiv) he can ask for a deduction, in five consecutive years,\nof the expenditure he has incurred on the acquisition of the\nasset. For  this purpose, we are assuming that an asset used\nfor scientific research related to the business is also ipso\nfacto an  asset used  for the purpose of business. There has\nbeen some  debate before  us as to whether this is always so\nbut we need not enter into that controversy for the purposes\nof the present case.\n     It will  at once  be seen that, if these two provisions\nare applied   simultaneously, it would result in granting an\nassessee  a   double  allowance	  in  respect  of  the	same\nexpenditure -  one of  the entire amount over a period	of 5\nyears and  the other  a percentage of the expenditure over a\nnumber .  consecutive years  at a  graded scale	 as  already\nmentioned. The	question at  once leaps	 to the	 mind as  to\nwhether it  could have been the intention of the legislature\nto  permit   both  these  deductions  simultaneously  to  an\nassessee. The  provisions of  clauses (d)  and	(e)  of	 the\nproviso to  S.10(2) (xiv)  contain a  clue  to	answer	this\nquestion. More about it later.\n     We next  turn to  the provisions of 1961 Act. The topic\nof depreciation	 is dealt  with by section 32. Section 32(1)\n(ii) provides for depreciation. As under the 1922 Act, it is\nallowed at a percentage of the written down value of certain\ncapital assets	employed in  the  bussiness.  The  topic  of\nscientific research expenditure is dealt with by section 35.\nSection 35(1)  provides for  the deduction  of four types of\nexpenditure on	scientific	research  and  what  we	 are\nconcerned with is the deduction provided under section 35(1)\n(iv), which is to the following effect:\n     (iv) in  respect of any expenditure\n     of a  capital nature  on scientific\n     research related  to  the	business\n     carried on	 by the	 assessee,  such\n     deduction	as   may  be  admissible\n     under  the	    provisions	of  sub-\n     section (2).\"\n     Sub-section (2)  provides that,  for  the	purposes  of\nclause (iv)of  sub-section (1),	 one-fifth  of	the  capital\nexpenditure incurred  in any previous year shall be deducted\nfor that  previous year;  and the balance of the expenditure\nshall be  deducted in  equal instalments in each of the four\nimmediately  succeeding	  previous  years.   There   is	  an\nexplanation which  is not relevant for our present purposes.\nReading S.35(2) further, it provides in clauses (iv) and (v)\nas follows:\n     \"(iv) where  a deduction is allowed\n     for any  previous year  under  this\n     section in	 respect of  expenditure\n     represented wholly	 or partly by an\n     asset,  no	  deduction   shall   be\n     allowed under clauses (i), (ii) and\n     (iii) of sub-section (1) of section\n     32 for  the same  previous year  in\n     respect of that asset;\n     (v) where	the asset  mentioned  in\n     clause (ii) is used in the business\n     after it  ceases  to  be  used  for\n     scientific research related to that\n     business,	depreciation   shall  be\n     admissible under  clauses (i), (ii)\n     and  (iii)	  of  sub-section(1)  of\n     section 32.\"\nReference must	also be made to Explanation 1 to s. 43(1) in\nthis context. It read as follows at the relevant time:\n     \"Explanation:  Where  an  asset  is\n     used in business after it ceases to\n     be	 used  for  scientific	research\n     related  to  that	business  and  a\n     deduction	has  to	 be  made  under\n     clause (i),  clause (ii)  or clause\n     (iii) of  sub-section (I)	or  sub-\n     section  (1A)   of	 section  32  in\n     respect of	 that asset,  the actual\n     cost of  the asset to the assessee,\n     as reduced	 by the	 amount	 of  any\n     deduction allowed under clause (iv)\n     of sub-section (1) of section 35 or\n     under any	corresponding  provision\n     of the  Indian Income-tax Act, 1922\n     (11 of 1922).\"\n     From the  above it	 will be seen that the provisions of\nSection 32(1)  (ii) and	 Section 35(2) (i) (iv) and (v) read\nwith  Explanation   1  to   s.43(1)  virtually	 repeat	 the\nprovisions contained in Section 10(2) (vi) and 10(2)(xiv) of\nthe 1922  Act, so  that the  question  earlier	posed  still\nloomed in the  background of 1961 Act.\n     In 1968  there was	 an amendment  in the  provisions of\nSection 35(2).	The  sub-section  was  amended	to  read  as\nfollows:\n     \"(2) For  the  purposes  of  clause\n     (iv) of sub-section (1),-\n     (i) in  a case  where such	 capital\n     expenditure is  incurred before the\n     1st day  of April,	 1967, one-fifth\n     of the capital expenditure incurred\n     in	 any   previous	 year  shall  be\n     deducted for  that	 previous  year;\n     and the  balance of the expenditure\n     shall   be	   deducted   in   equal\n     instalments for  each of  the  four\n     immediately   succeeding	previous\n     years;\n     (i-a) in  a case where such capital\n     expenditure is  incurred after  the\n     31st day  of March, 1967, the whole\n     of	  such	  capital    expenditure\n     incurred in any previous year shall\n     be	 deducted   for	 that	previous\n     year.\"\n     The effect	 of this amendment was only to provided that\nthe  entire   amount  of  capital  expenditure	incurred  in\nrelation to  scientific research  was allowed as a deduction\nin one	year instead  of being	spread over a period of five\nyears as  was the  position earlier. This amendment does not\ntouch the   controversy	 in issue  before us  and it  has no\nsolution to offer to our present difficulty.\n     The provisions  of Section	 10(2) (vi) and (xiv) of the\nold Act	 had been administered between 1946 and 1962 and the\nprovisions of  Section 32  and 35  of the 1961 Act have been\nadministered since  1962. The  question	 whether an assessee\ncan  simultaneously  claim  an	allowance  or  deduction  in\nrespect of  the same  expenditure once	under Section 32 and\nagain in   Section 35 must have cropped up in some cases and\ndoes appear that such a double claim was put forward in some\ncases. The  contention on  behalf of  the assessees was that\nthe allowances	in respect  of depreciation  on the one hand\nand in respect of capital expenditure on scientific research\non the other are two totally different and independent heads\nof allowances.	 one  is a notional allowance to provide for\nthe wear  and tear  of	a  capital  asset  employed  in	 the\nbusiness as the years roll by; the other is an allowance for\nactual expenditure  of a  capital nature granted, on the eve\nof our	country&apos;s independence,	 in order  to give fillip to\nnew industrial innovations and the development of indigenous\nknow-how and  techniques by  proper planning on research and\ndevelopment by	various business  houses. It  is   therefore\nsuggested that	there is  nothing absurd  in construing	 the\nstatutes act  as providing  cumulatively for  both types  of\ndeductions in  respect of  the same  capital asset. The only\nlimitations on	this right are the two placed by the statute\nitself. The first limitation, contained in clause (d) of the\nproviso to  Section 10(2)  (xiv) and  s.35(2) (iv)  is	that\nboth the deductions cannot be claimed \"for the same previous\nyear\" in  respect of  the same	capital	 asset.	 The  second\nlimitation is found in clause (e) of the proviso  to Section\n10(2) (xiv)  and s.35(2)  (v) which  say that  if a  capital\nasset used  for scientific research ceases to be so used but\nis thereafter  brought into a  business for use therein, the\nactual cost for purposes of granting depreciation in respect\nof the asset thereafter should be taken as the amount of its\noriginal cost  reduced by  the amount  of deductions allowed\nunder Section  10(2) (xiv)  or s.35(2).	 In other words, the\ncontention of the assessee was and is that both the types of\nallowances are	permissible under  the statute except to the\nextent limited	by clauses  (d) and  (e) of  the proviso  to\nSection 10(2)  (xiv) of	 the  1922  Act	 and  reproduced  in\nclauses (iv) and (v) of	 Section 35(2) of the 1961 Act.\n     Before us	it is claimed on behalf of the assessee that\nthis interpretation  of the  statutory	provisions  is	very\nclear, patent  and unambiguous.	 It is	alleged that despite\nthis, some Income-tax Officers started disallowing the claim\nof depreciation	 in respect  of such  capital assets even in\nprevious years	during which  no deduction  was	 claimed  or\nallowed under Section 10(2) (xiv) or Section 35(2), contrary\nto the	clear language	of clause  (d) of  s.10(2) (xiv) and\ns.35(2) (iv). These Of orders were reversed on appeal either\nby the	Appellate Commissioner	or by  the Tribunal.  It was\nsuggested that	these decisions	 were almost  unanimously in\nfavour of  the assessee	 but the   department  persisted  in\npursuing the  matter upto  the stage of the High Court. Only\none reference  on this	topic came up before the High Courts\nand is	reflected in  the decision  of	the  Karnataka	High\nCourt, reported	 as CIT v. Indian Telephone Industries Ltd.,\n(1980) 126 I.T.R. 528. This was a reference of the year 1977\nmade at	 the instance  of the Commissioner of Income Tax and\nthe Commissioner of Income Tax lost this reference. The High\n(Sourt	re-affirmed   the  position  contended	for  by	 the\nassessee as  the one and only possible interpretation of the\nstatutory provisions. It is, therefore, contended that there\nwas, and  could have  been, no	doubt that  an assessee	 was\nentitled to  claim depreciation allowance in respect of such\nassets in  respect of  previous years  other than  those  in\nwhich an  allowance   had been allowed under the other head.\nWe shall revert later to this aspect of the matter.\n     At this stage, the Finance (No.2) Act, 1980 intervened.\nIt amended section 35(2) (iv) to read as follows:\n     \"(iv) where  a deduction is allowed\n     for any  previous year  under  this\n     section in	 respect of  expenditure\n     represented wholly	 or partly by an\n     asset,  no	  deduction   shall   be\n     allowed   under clauses  (i),  (ii)\n     and (iii)	of  sub-section	 (1)  of\n     section 32	 for  the  same	 or  any\n     other previous  year in  respect of\n     that asset.\"\n		      (Emphasis added)\n     The  Finance  Act	made  this  amendment  retrospective\nw.e.f. 1.4.62,	that is, the date of the commencement of the\n1961 Act.  This amendment is undoubtedly far-reaching in its\neffect.	 It   will  result  in	completion  of	the  pending\nassessments of	several years  on the  footing	of  the	 new\nprovision. It  will also involve re-opening or rectification\nof completed  assessments of  earlier years,  to the  extent\npermissible under the provisions of sections 148 and 154, in\ncases where  assessees had  been granted  \"double allowance\"\naccepting their	 contention at	the  time  of  the  original\nassessments. The  effect will be not for one assessment year\nbut for a number of assessment years in succession. Painting\na very	grim picture  of the  consequences  of	giving	full\nretrospective effect  to the  amendment, the  assessees	 say\nthat it will impose unexpected and impossible burden on them\nover the  years. jeopardise their solvency and lay them open\nto action  by creditor	and financial  institutions. Such an\nonerous burden, it is said. is unreasonable\nand  oppressive	 and  the  provision  imposing	such  burden\nviolates the  fundamental  rights  of  the  assessees  under\nArticles 14  and 19(1)	(g) of the Constitution of India. It\nis on  this plea  that, even  though assessments and appeals\nare pending in several of these cases, the petitioners chose\nto approach  this Court	 by  way  of  writ  petitions  under\nArticle 32  of	the  Constitution.  These  are	mostly	writ\npetitions of the year 1981 and are now coming up for hearing\nafter a period of 10 years.\n     Learned counsel  for the  assessees do  not contest the\ncompetence  of	 the  legislature   to	enact  the  impugned\nprovision, nor	do they dispute the right of the legislature\nto give	 retrospective effect  to statutory  provisions. The\ncontention only	 is that  retrospective	 provisions  may  be\npermissible   even in  taxing statutes	in  certain  special\ncircumstances such  as in  the case of provisions clarifying\nthe  impact   of  a  statute,  provisions  curing  defective\nlegislations in	 the light of the judicial decisions and the\nlike. They,  however, say that if the legislature chooses to\nimpose a  totally new  burden,	which  was  not	 at  all  in\ncontemplation	earlier	   and	 proceeds   to	 give	full\nretrospective effect  thereto, such  an	 attempt  should  be\nstruck	down   as    unreasonable  and	discriminatory.	 The\nprincipal questions, therefore, for our consideration are:\n     1)	 Were	the  earlier   statutory\n     provisions capable	 of  only    one\n     interpretation, namely, that placed\n     by the  assessees or  was there any\n     ambiguity in relation thereto ?\n     (2) If  there  was	 some  doubt  or\n     ambiguity	 about	  the	 earlier\n     legislation,  and	 the  1980   Act\n     clarified	 the   position	  by   a\n     retrospective amendment,  would  it\n     offend  the   provisions	of   the\n     Constitution ?\n     (3) If,  on  the  other  hand,  the\n     earlier provision	was  very  clear\n     and    capable    of    only    one\n     interpretation, as	 placed	 by  the\n     assessee,	 was   the   legislature\n     within its	 rights in  amending the\n     provision	retrospectively	  w.e.f.\n     1.4.62   and   thus   imposing   an\n     unreasonable  tax	 burden	 on  the\n     assessees?\n     Taking up	the first  of the three questions, it has to\nbe considered  from two	 angles, one  factual and the other,\nlegal. An  attempt was	made on behalf of the petitioners to\nproject an  image as  if the  interpretation  sought  to  be\nplaced by  the department on pre-1980 provisions to disallow\ndepreciation on such assets was so far-fetched that it never\nreceived the  approval of  the higher appellate authorities.\nIt was	suggested that	the appeals by assessees against the\ndisallowance invariably	 succeeded and it was the Department\nthat had  to move  the High Court on reference, the first of\nwhich references came up before the Karnataka High Court in\nC.l.T. v.  Indian Telephone  Industries	 (1980)	 126  I.T.R.\n548 and was answered against the Department. On the basis of\nsuch allegations  the petitioners attempted to make out that\nthe Department&apos;s  interpretation was  patently untenable and\nthat the  1980 amendment is not in the nature of a statutory\nclarification of  an ambiguity	but a  totally new and fresh\nimposition sought  to be  unjustifiably given  retrospective\neffect.\n     But, as Shri B.B. Ahuja has pointed out on the basis of\nthe averments  of the  petitioner in one of the cases, viz.,\nW.P.1153/81, the  impression sought  to be  created  by	 the\npetitioners does  not accord  with the	correct	 facts.	 The\nposition in  the case  is available  only as it stood at the\ntime when  the writ  petition and the counter affidavit were\nfiled	and   subsequent   developments	  are	not   known.\nNevertheless, the  picture that	 emerges is  this.  In	that\ncase, the  Income-tax  Officer	(I.T.O.)  is  said  to	have\nallowed depreciation on assets used for scientific research,\nfor the	 assessment year  1969-70, though  this is denied by\nthe department.	 The claim  was perhaps	 disallowed  by	 the\nI.T.O. for the assessment year 1970-71, but it was allowed\nby the	Allahabad Bench of the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal\n(I.T.A.T.) by  its order  dated 30.8.76.  For the assessment\nyear 1971-72,  the I.T.O.  disallowed the  depreciation. The\nAppellate Assistant  Commissioner (A.A.C.)  allowed it.	 The\ndepartment appealed to the Delhi Bench of the I.T.A.T. which\naccepted the department&apos;s plea by its order dated 13.8.79\n placing  reliance on the decision of a Special Bench of the\nI.T.A.T. It  has been  stated that  the	 assessee  filed  an\napplication for	 reference  to	the  High  Court  which	 was\npending when the writ petition was filed. For the assessment\nyears 1972-73  to 1974-75,  the assessments are pending as a\nstay order  had been  obtained for  reasons  which  are	 not\nknown. For  the assessment  years 1975-76  and 1976-77,	 the\nassessee claimed  depreciation	on  a  number  of  items  of\nscientific research  assets. The I.T.O. \"allowed\" the claims\nsubject to  the rider  that \"there  is no  provision to give\ndeduction of  more than	 100% of  the expenditure  by way of\ndepreciation\". The  assessee  appealed	to  Commissioner  of\nIncome-tax (Appeals)  who disallowed the claim. For 1977-78,\nthe l.T.O. disallowed the claim and the C.l.T. dismissed the\nassessee&apos;s appeals. For assessment years 1978-79 to 1980-81,\nthe assessments	 are stated  to be  pending. The above facts\nare sufficient to show that, atleast after 1.4.1968, - there\nis no  information before  us as  to  the  position  between\n1.4.1946 and  31.3.1968 -  the Department  has been  putting\nforward its  objections on  the issue  and that the same was\nthe subject  matter  of	 controversy  at  various  appellate\nstages, some  decided in  favour of,  and some	against, the\nassessee. A Special Bench of the l.T.A.T. had indeed decided\nthe issue  against the	assessee. In  this background, it is\nnot correct  to say  that the position was crystal clear and\nthat, save  for a  few ITOs  who took  a biassed  view,	 the\nauthorities were  all agreed that the Department&apos;s stand was\nuntenable. Some	 of the	 reported decisions  also show	that\nthere was  a live  controversy and that references have been\nmade to	 the  High  Court  both	 at  the  instances  or	 the\nassessees [see	Alkali &amp;  Chemical Corporation of India Ltd.\nv. C.l.T. (1986) 161 I.T.R. 820 (Cal.), and C.I.T. v. Indian\nExplosives Ltd.,  (1992) 192  I.T.R. 144 (Cal.)], as well as\nat the instance of the Revenue [see, C.I.T. v. International\nInstruments P. Ltd., (1983) 144 I.T.R. 936 (Kar.); C.I.T. v.\nMahindra Sintered Products Ltd. (1986) 161 I.T.R. 692 (Bom.)\nand Warner  Hindustan Ltd.  v. CIT,  (1988) 171	 I.T.R.	 224\n(A.P.)]. The petitioner&apos;s contention that, under the\n pre-amended  provisions, depreciation	on such	 assets	 was\nrecognised  allround   as  clearly  allowable  is  therefore\nrejected. We  have dealt  with this  aspect only  to meet an\naspect that  was urged. What is really important is the true\nand correct  interpretation of	those provisions,  not	what\nsomeone thought	 of it	then and to this aspect we shall now\nturn.\n \n     The second	 aspect of  the First of the three questions\nposed  earlier	 for  our  consideration  is  the  legal  or\ninterpretational aspect	 of the	 provisions  as	 they  stood\nprior to  the 1980  Amendment. Under  the provisions  of the\nstatute as  they stood	earlier, could	the  assessees	have\nclaimed continued  grant of depreciation after the expiry of\nfive previous  years before the 1968 amendment and after the\nexpiry or  the first  year after  the 1968  amendment,	even\nthough the  entire cost of the capital asset in question had\nbeen allowed  to  be  written  off  completely	against	 the\nbusiness  profits  of  those  five  previous  years  or	 one\nprevious year  as the  case may	 be? We	 think the answer to\nthis question  must emphatically  be in the negative. In our\nview, it is impossible to conceive of the legislature having\nenvisaged  a   double  deduction  in  respect  of  the	same\nexpenditure, even  though it  is true  that the two heads of\ndeduction do  not  completely  overlap	and  there  is	some\ndifference in  the rationale  of the  two  deductions  under\nconsideration. On behalf of the assessees reliance is placed\non the	following circumstances to support a contention that\nthe statute  did not  intend one  deduction to	preclude the\nother :\n     (i) lt  is pointed	 out that  s.10(2) (xiv) of the 1922\nAct, was  inserted in  1946 consequent on the insertion of a\ncorresponding  provision   in  the   United  Kingdom.	That\nprovision, viz. s.20(4) of the U.K. Finance Act, 1944\n read thus :\n     (4) Where	a deduction  is	 allowed\n     for any  year under  this	 or  the\n     last preceding  section in	 respect\n     of expenditure   represented wholly\n     or	 partly	  by  any   assets,   no\n     deduction	 shall be  allowed under\n     any provisions  of	 the  Income-tax\n     Act other	than this  part of  this\n     Act in  respect of	 wear and  tear,\n     obsolescence,    depreciation    or\n     exceptional depreciation  of  these\n     assets for	 any year  of assessment\n     during any	 part of  which they are\n     used by  the person carrying on the\n     trade   for   scientific	research\n     related to the trade. \"\n	  (emphasis supplied)\n     The Indian provision, it is said, has made a deliberate\ndeparture from	the said  provision and	 limited the  bar of\ndepreciation only  to those  previous years  during which  a\ndeduction is allowed under S.10(2) (xiv);\n     (ii) When	the Income-tax	Bill,  1961  was  under	 the\nconsideration of  the  Law  Commission,	 the  provisions  of\nS.10(2) (vi)  and (xiv) were carefully reviewed. But changes\nwere made  and the  provisions of the new Act in this regard\nwere drafted in pari materia with those of the old Act ;\n     (iii) The language used in clause (d) of the proviso to\nS.10(2)	 (xiv)	and  S.35(2)  (iv)  again  is  significantly\ndifferent from the language used in various other provisions\nof the	Act which,  in	like  contexts	of  possible  double\nallowances, emphatically  rule out  deductions in respect of\nthe same expense or exemptions in respect of the same income\nunder two  different provisions	 for the  same or  even	 any\nother assessment  year :  See, for  example, Sections  20(2)\n35B(2), 35C(2), 35CC(4), 35CCA(3), 35CCB(3), 35D(b), 35E(8),\n80GGA(4), 80HH(9A), 80HHA(7) and 80HHB(S); and\n     (iv) When the relevant provisions say that depreciation\nshall not be allowed in certain previous years, it permits a\ndisallowance only  in those  previous years  and  means,    The seeds of the present controversy were sown as early as in 1946. It is unfortunate that this matter should be coming up before this Court for its consideration nearly five decades later, though it must be pointed out that the issue in its present form is the outcome of an amendment made by the Finance (No.2) Act, 1980 (hereinafter referred to as \'the 1980 Act\') to the Income Tax Act, 1961* (hereinafter referred to as \'the 1961 Act\'). It is also a curious co-incidence that the 1980 Act effected two amendments in the 1961 Act with retrospective effect and the validity of both these provisions have been challenged before the courts. The first was the controversy with regard to the retrospective amendment of s.80-J which was settled by this Court by its decision in Lohia Machines Limited v. Union of India, (1985) 152 I.T.R. 308 (SC). It is the second amendment to the provisions contained in section 35(2) of the 1961 Act that has given rise to the present controversy between the parties.\r\n\r\nheld: So far as the arguments of taking away of vested rights is concerned, it is evident from the facts stated in the writ petition 1153/81 - which was treated as representative of the facts and contentions in all the writ petitions and with reference to which facts were arguments addressed itself that none of the assessments relating to any of the assessment years concerned herein has become final. They are pending at one or the other stage and in one or the other forum. I need not dilate upon this aspect inasmuch as the impugned amendment merely makes explicit what was implicit in the unamended clause, as explained hereinabove. In such a situation, the argument of any right vesting in the assessees is misplaced.\r\n\r\nThe writ petitions accordingly fail and are dismissed. No costs.\r\n\r\nPetitions  was dismissed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ','Sachalmal Parasram Vs Ratnabai And Ors. JUDGMENT S.M. Sikri, C.J.\r\n\r\n1. This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh dismissing the appeal filed by the appellant before us. The relevant facts for the determination of the points raised before us are as follows :\r\n\r\n2. Respondents Nos. 1, 2 and 3, who were the owners of the premises in dispute, mortgaged the premises in favour of respondent No. 4, with possession. Vide two mortgage deeds dated December 5, 1947 and October 26, 1948, for the amounts of 12,000/-and Rs. 4,000/- respectively. The date of payment was October 8, 1952, but by a subsequent agreement dated November 18, 1952, this was extended. The agreement further provided as follows :\r\n\r\nThe portion of the house in your side shall remain with you at a rental of Rs. 50/- per month. It was with you previously at Rs. 43/- per month. We shall not be responsible for any decrease or increase in the rental thereof. You shall have the right to let out the half portion of the shop on your side to any person at full rent\r\n\r\nOn May 1, 1958 respondent No. 4, the mortgagee in possession, filed a suit for foreclosure. During the pendency of this suit he let out the premises to the appellant at Rs. 55/- per month. It was provided in the rent agreement between the mortgagee and the appellant that &quot;incase the owner of the house gets the house released from mortgage under us, then I shall get the house vacated for you and hand it over to you.&quot; On September 28, 1960, a compromised decree for redemption was passed. The mortgagors, in execution of the said compromise decree, sought to take possession of the premises in dispute, which had been rented to the appellant. The appellant&#39;s objections under Order 21 Rule 97, CPC, were ultimately disallowed by the High Court, in revision, on April 18, 1964. The appellant then filed the present suit under Order 21, Rule 103, CPC for a declaration that &quot;the plaintiff (appellant) being the tenant of defendants Nos. 1, 2 and 3 (respondents) cannot be evicted unless eviction proceedings are taken against him under M.P. Premises Control Act.&quot; In the alternative, the appellant prayed for a declaration that &quot;if the plaintiff is considered to be the tenant of deft No. 4 even after the redemption decree the plaintiff cannot be evicted. He also prayed for a consequential permanent injunction. The Trial Court dismissed the suit. An appeal before the Additional District Judge also failed. As already mentioned, the second appeal before the High Court also failed.\r\n\r\n3. The learned Counsel for the appellant submitted that respondent No. 4, being the mortgagee in possession, had the right to let the premises in dispute both under Section 76 of the Transfer of Property Act, and under the agreement dated November 18, 1952. According to him, this act was an act prudent management and was binding on the respondents Nos. 1, 2 and 3. He further contended that he was protected by the provisions of the Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Control Act, 1961, and could not be evicted except in accordance with the provisions of that Act.\r\n\r\n4. The points raised by Mr. Naunit Lal are concluded by the decision of this Court in All India Film Corporation Ltd. v. Sri Rajagyan Nath : , which decision was unfortunately not brought to our notice during the course of the hearing. In this case the facts were similar. A mortgagee in possession had let out the premises, which was a cinema house, and the lessee had further sublet the same, to sub-les Sections On redemption the purchaser\r\n Property - Mortgage - Section 76(a) of Transfer of Property Act, 1882 - High Court expelled Appeal documented by Appellant for assertion that Plaintiff being an occupant can not be removed unless ousting procedures are taken against him and furthermore petitioned God for significant lasting directive - Hence, this Appeal - Whether, demonstration of rent was not demonstration of judicious administration - Held, long rent on such little lease was not demonstration of reasonability - However, Section 76(a) of Act expressed that demonstrations done genuine and wisely in common course of administration bound even after end of title of mortgagee under lock and key - Moreover, lease deed itself stipulated that renter would empty house and hand over same to Respondent on the off chance that proprietor of House got house discharged from home loan - There was no landowner and no inhabitant - Therefore arrangements of Rent Restriction Act couldn&#39;t matter - Appeal rejected.\r\n Disposed off','Hira Lal Rattan Lal Etc.

They  raise\ncommon questions of law for decision, and they are  directed\nagainst a common judgment of the Allahabad High Court.\nThe  facts  of the case lie within a  narrow  compass.	 The\nappellants  are dealers in foodgrains including cereals	 and\npulses	especially  split or processed foodgrains  and	dal.\nThe dispute in this case centers round the question  whether\nthe  Government	 is  competent	to  levy  sales-tax  on	 the\npurchases   made  by  the  appellants  of  split   processed\nfoodgrains  and	 dal  under the	 provisions  of	 the  United\nProvinces  Sales  Tax  Act, 1948 as  amended  by  the  Uttar\nPradesh	 Sales Tax Act (Amendment and Validation) Act,	1970\n(which will hereinafter be referred to as the Act).\nUnder  the Sales Tax Act as it originally stood	 which	will\n-hereinafter  be  referred  to as the  principal  Act),	 the\npurchases  of  split  or processed  foodgrains	and  dal  by\ndealers	 were sought, to be brought to tax under s.  3-D  of\nthe  principal Act read with the notification  issued.	 The\nvalidity  of the levy was challenged by Tilock Chand  Prasan\nKumar,	the appellant in Civil Appeal NO&apos;. 1625 of  1971  in\nrespect	 of  the assessment made on him for  the  assessment\nyear  1966-67  by assessment order dated June  30,  1968  by\nmeans of a writ petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution.\nThe  High  Court of Allahabad struck down the  levy  holding\nthat the dal purchased by the petitioner before it could not\nbe  said  to be a commodity essentially different  from	 the\narhar  dal  purchased by the dal mills and  accordingly	 the\npurchases effected by the petitioner could not be  regarded\nas  the first purchases.  This decision is reported  in	 25,\nS.T.C.	p. 118.	 Thereafter the Governor of U.P.  issued  an\nordinance  known as Uttar Pradesh Sales Tax  (Amendment	 and\nValidation) Ordinance, 1970 (U.P. Ordinance\n \nNo. 2 of 1970) adding inter alia Explanation 11 to s. 3-D as\nwell as s. 7 to the principal Act.  This ordinance was later\non  enacted  as	 an  Act  to  which  we	 have  already	made\nreference.  The provisions of the Amending Act are identical\nwith the provisions in the Ordinance.  Though at the time of\nthe  institution  of  the writ petitions  from	which  these\nappeals arise, the Ordinance had not yet been made into	 the\nAct, the Amending Act came into force during the pendency of\nthe writ petitions.  Hence we shall refer to the  provisions\nof the Amending Act.\n	      Under the principal Act a dealer is defined in\n	      s.  2(c)	as \" \"dealer\" means  any  person  or\n	      association   of	persons	 carrying   on	 the\n	      business	of buying or selling goods in  Uttar\n	      Pradesh, whether for commission,	remuneration\n	      or  otherwise, and includes any firm or  Hindu\n	      Joint   Family  and  any	society,   club	  or\n	      association  which sells goods to its  members\n	      and also includes any department of the  State\n	      Government  or  the Central  Government  which\n	      carries  on such business and any	 undertaking\n	      engaged  in the generation or distribution  of\n	      electrical energy or any other form of power.\"\n	      (Explanation  to the section is  not  relevant\n	      for our present purpose).\n	      Section 3 of the Act provides for the levy  of\n	      multi-point tax.	The portion of that  section\n	      which  is	 material for  our  present  purpose\n	      reads :\n	      \"Subject to the provisions of this Act,  every\n	      dealer shall, for each assessment year, pay a\n	      lax at the rate of two naye paise per rupee on\n	      his  turnover  of such year,  which  shall  be\n	      determined   in	such  manner   as   may	  be\n	      prescribed\"\n	      Section  3-A  provides  for  a  single   point\n	      taxation in respect of sale of certain  goods.\n	      At  present we are only concerned with  s.  3-\n	      D(1).  It provides :\n	      \"Except as provided in sub-section (2),  there\n	      shall be levied and paid, for each  assessment\n	      year  or part thereof, a tax on the  turnover,\n	      to  be  determined in such manner	 as  may  be\n	      prescribed,  of  first  purchases	 made  by  a\n	      dealer  or  through  a  dealer,  acting  as  a\n	      purchasing  agent in respect of such goods  or\n	      class  of	 goods,	 and  at  such	rates,	 not\n	      exceeding	 two paise per rupee in the case  of\n	      foodgrains, including cereals and pulses,	 and\n	      five  paise  per rupee in the  case  of  other\n	      goods and with effect from such date, as	may,\n	      from  time to time, be notified by the,  State\n	      Government in this behalf.\"\n	      (Explanation 1 to this section is not relevant\n	      for our purpose).\n \nThe notification issued under s. 3-D of the principal Act on\nOctober	 1,  1964 (Notification No. S. T.  7122/X)  provided\nthat  with  effect  from October 1, 1964,  the	turnover  of\npurchases  in  respect of goods mentioned therein  shall  be\nliable to tax under s. 3-D at the rate mentioned:\n\"Foodgrains    1.5 paise per rupee on first purchase\nOn  the	 basis	of s. 3-D read	with  the  notification,  as\nmentioned  earlier, the authorities under the Act sought  to\nbring to tax under the principal Act the first purchases  of\nprocessed  or split foodgrains including dal on	 the  ground\nthat  they constituted a separate item of  foodgrains  quite\nindependent  of the unprocessed or unsplit foodgains.	This\nview, as seen above, was negatived by the High Court.  After\nthe  decision  of  the High Court,  the	 principal  Act	 was\namended.   Under  the.	Amending Act  one  more	 Explanation\nviz., Explanation 11 was added to s. 3-D.\n	      \"For  the purposes of this sub-section,  split\n	      or  processed foodgrains, such as in the	form\n	      of  dal shall be deemed to be  different	from\n	      unsplit	or   unprocessed   foodgrains,	 and\n	      accordingly, nothing in this sub-section shall\n	      be  construed to prevent the imposition,	levy\n	      or  collection  of the tax in respect  of	 the\n	      first   purchases	  of  split   or   processed\n	      foodgrains  merely because. tax had  been	 im-\n	      posed  levied or collected earlier in  respect\n	      of the first purchases of those foodgrains  in\n	      their unsplit or unprocessed form.\"\n	      The  Amending  Act  also	added  a  validating\n	      provision to the principal Act viz. s. 7. That\n	      section reads :\n	      \"Notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order\n	      of  any  court or tribunal  to  the  contrary,\n	      every  notification  issued or  purporting  to\n	      have been issued under Section 3-A or  Section\n	      3-D  of  the  principal Act  before  the	com-\n	      mencement of this Act shall be deemed to	have\n	      been  issued under that section as amended  by\n	      this  Act and shall be so interpreted  and  be\n	      deemed to be and always to have been as  valid\n	      as if the provisions of this Act were in force\n	      at   all	material  times;   and	 accordingly\n	      anything	done or any action taken  (including\n	      any order made, proceeding taken, jurisdiction\n	      exercised,  assessment  made, or	tax  levied,\n	      collected or paid purporting to have been done\n	      or   taken   in	pursuance   of	 any	such\n	      notification)  shall  be	deemed	to  be,	 and\n	      always to have been, validly and lawfully done\n	      or taken.\"\n	      It will be necessary later on to consider what\n	      was the vice that the legislature intended  to\n	      cure by the Amending Act.	 The\n	      --L498Sup Cl/73\n \n	      sequence	 of  events  itself  discloses	 the\n	      purpose  of  the	Ordinance  as  well  as	 the\n	      Amending	Act.  That apart, the  statement  of\n	      objects  and  reasons which  can	be  usefully\n	      looked  into  for the purpose of	finding	 the\n	      vice  that  the  legislature  was	 trying	  to\n	      provide against reads thus\n	      \"Sections	 3-A and 3-D of the U.P.  Sales	 Tax\n	      Act,  1948 provide for single point  taxation.\n	      Under the fondler section the tax is levied on\n	      the turnover of sales, while under the  latter\n	      the  tax	is levied on the turnover  of  first\n	      purchases.  Plain and ornamented glass bangles\n	      are subject to tax separately under section 3-\n	      A.   Similarly, unsplit and split	 pulses	 are\n	      separately  subject to tax under section	3-D.\n	      It has been held by the High Court in one case\n	      that tax cannot be levied separately on  plain\n	      and ornamented glass bangles under section 3-A\n	      and  in  another	that tax  cannot  be  levied\n	      separately  on unsplit and split pulses  under\n	      section  3-D  because in their  opinion  plain\n	      glass  bangles are not a	commodity  different\n	      from  ornamented glass bangles  and  similarly\n	      unsplit  pulses and split pulses are also	 not\n	      two  different commodities.

They further  took	 the\n	      plea that the amendments incorporated were not\n	      effective	 enough	 to bring to tax  the  first\n	      purchases of split or processed foodgrains and\n	      pulses.	 The  High  Court   rejected   these\n	      contentions and dismissed the writ  petitions.\n	      Thereafter  these	 appeals have  been  brought\n	      after  obtaining	certificates from  the	High\n	      Court.\n	      The  validity  of	 the levy  in  question	 was\n	      challenged on the following grounds&apos;:\n	      (1)   That  no fresh levy can be imposed by  a\n	      retrospective legislation;\n \n	      (2)   That  the legislature cannot in case  of\n	      legislation  of the nature with which  we	 are\n	      concerned,    separate	into	 independent\n	      commodities   split  and	unsplit	 pulses	  or\n	      processed	 or unprocessed pulses and  on	that\n	      footing  seek to impose tax twice over on	 the\n	      same commodity in respect of the goods  liable\n	      to be taxed at a single point;\n	      (3)   That  the newly added Explanation to  s.\n	      3-D read with s. 7 of the Amending Act amounts\n	      to an unlawful usurpation of judicial power by\n	      the legislature;\n	      (4)   The newly added Explanation II to s. 3-D\n	      is violative of Art. 14 of the  Constitution\n	      There  is	 no rational  basis  for  separating\n	      split  or	 processed pulses  from	 unsplit  or\n	      unprocessed pulses;\n	      (5)   On a true construction of Explanation It\n	      to s. 3-D no fresh charge can be held to	have\n	      been imposed,\n	      (6)   No	levy  of purchase tax  can  be	made\n	      without a fresh Notification under s. 3-D read\n	      with Explanation 11 showing therein separately\n	      foodgrains  unsplit or unprocessed as well  as\n	      foodgrains split or processed; and\n	      (7)   That   the	 power	conferred   on	 the\n	      Government   under  s.  3-D  amounts   to	  an\n	      excessive delegation of legislative power. and\n	      consequently void.\nThe  source  of	 the  legislative power	 to  levy  sales  or\npurchase  tax  on goods is Entry 54 of the List	 II  of	 the\nConstitution.	 It   is  well	settled	 that	subject	  to\nconstitutional restrictions a power to legislate includes  a\npower to legislate prospectively as well as retrospectively.\nIn this regard legislative power to impose tax also includes\nwithin	itself	the power to  tax  retrospectively--see	 The\nUnion of India v. Madan Gopal Kabra;(1) M. P.  Sundararamier\n&amp;  Co. v. The State of Andhra Pradesh and Anr. (2) ;  J.  K.\nJute Mills Co. Ltd. v. The State of Uttar Pradesh and  Anr.;\n(3) Chhotabhai Jethabhai Patel and Co. v. The Union of India\nand Anr. (4 Sri Ramkrishna &amp; Ors. v. The State of Bihar. (5)\nIn the last mentioned case it was specifically decided	that\nwhere  the legislature can make a valid law, it can  provide\nnot  only  for	the prospective operation  of  the  material\nprovisions  of the said law but it can also provide for	 the\nretrospective operation of the said provisions.\nWe see no force in the second contention advanced on  behalf\nof  the	 appellants.  As seen earlier the  general  rule  as\nenunciated in s. 3 is multi point tax sales tax or  purchase\ntax; but power\n(1) [1954] S. C. R. 541.\n(2)  [1958] S. C. R. 1422.\n(3)  12.

Legislature  was	 not  incompetent  to  separate	 the\nprocessed  or split pulses from the unsplit  or	 unprocessed\npulses and treat the two as separate and independent goods.\nIn  Jagannath and Ors. v. Union of India,(1) question  arose\nfor  decision  whether	it was open to	the  legislature  to\nimpose	separate excise duty on tobacco leaf as well  as  on\nbroken leaf of tobacco.	 This Court overruled the contention\nthat  such a levy was invalid. It head that it was open	 for\nthe legislature to separate the two items.  We see no  basis\nfor  the  contention  that the legislature  cannot  for	 the\npurpose of tax under the Act separate the split or processed\nPulses	from the unsplit or unprocessed.  The power  of	 the\nlegislature  to specify the nature of the goods the sale  or\npurchase of which, it will bring to tax is very wide.\nNow coming to point No. 3, there is no justification for the\ncontention  that  the legislature has usurped  any  judicial\npower.	The legislature has not purported either directly or\nby  necessary implication to overrule the decisions  of	 the\nAllahabad  High.  Court in Tilok Chand Prasan  Kumar&apos;s	case\n(supra).   On the other hand it. has accepted tha Under the U.P. Deals Tax Act 1948 as it initially stood the \r\n\r\nbuys of split or handled foodgrains	and dal by \r\n\r\nmerchants were looked to be conveyed to assess under s. 3-D of the \r\n\r\nchief Act read with the notice issued. in a ','Mirza Nausherwan Khan &amp; Anr Vs The Collector (Land CIVIL  APPELLATE  JURISDICTION : Civil Appeal  No.  2025  of\n1968.\nAppeal	 from  the  judgment  and  decree  dated  the	18th\nOctober,1967  of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in C.

The contest  before  us  is\nconfined  to the quantum of compensation and, although	Shri\nVasudeva Pillai, counsel for the appellants&apos; has pressed his\npoints	with persistence, we are unable to disturb the	High\nCourt&apos;s award.\nThe land, vast in extent, had a building with a plinth	area\nof  3,300 sq. yds.  The area in which the acquired  plot  is\nsituate	 is  perhaps an important one in  the  City.   After\ngetting	 expert	 valuation  made of  the  buildings  by	 the\nCentral	 Public	 Works Department engineers,  the  Collector\nawarded a sum of Rs. 41,674/- for the buildings, Rs. 1,440/-\nfor the standing trees and a sum of Rs. 30,630/for a belt of\nland  50  ft.  deep  at Rs. 15/- per  square  yard  and	 Rs.\n99,435/-  for  the remaining area of 13,258 sq.	 yds.	The,\ntotal figure together with statutory solarium granted by the\nCollector was Rs. 1,99,155.85. This figure fell far short of\nthe ambitious claim of the appellant and, when the case came\nbefore	the  City Civil Court on a reference, there  was  an\nenhancement   of   compensation.    Although   the   learned\nAdditional Chief Judge held that the area was a little	less\nthan had been determined by the Collector, the market  value\nof the building was increased nearly four fold on the  basis\nof  a multiple of 25 times the rent fetched.  On  the  other\nitems also some changes were made and, consequentially,	 the\ntotal  amount was raised to Rs. 3,31,092/-.   The  appellant\narrived	 in  the High Court asking for more (and  the  State\nalso appears to have appealed, but its appeal was  dismissed\nand we are not therefore concerned with it).\nSome  measure of good fortune attended the appeal since	 the\nHigh Court altered the multiple from 25 to 27 in fixing	 the\ncompensation for the building.	Otherwise, it  substantially\naffirmed the findings of the trial Court, except that to the\nadvantage  of the appellant it restored the  area  acquired.\nThe net result was the appellant obtained a total sum of Rs.\n3,52,326.65 as compensation.\nIt is thus clear that from the Collector to the Civil  Court\nand  on, to the High Court. there has been an escalation  in\nthe  amount  of compensation and, hopefully, the  owner	 has\nreached	 this  Court with his appeal,  under  a	 certificate\nwhich  he  secured under Art. 133(1)(a)	 before	 the  recent\namendment.  We mention this because we are unable to discern\nany  substantial  question of law of general  importance  in\ncounsel&apos;s   submissions	 or  the  points  outlined  in	 the\nmemorandum of appeal which merits the consideration of	this\nCourt.\n \nMerely	because the claim is large the judgment need not  be\nlong  :and,  although  the appellant tried  to	spread	the,\ncanvas	 wide,	 we   regard   the   points   deserving	  of\nconsideration-as  falling  within  a  narrow  compass.	 The\nburden	of  the song has been that Hyderabad has,  for	his-\ntorical	 reasons,  become  a great city and  that  the	land\nacquired has precious potential value which has not  entered\nthe  judicial computation at the lesser levels. (By  way  of\naside  one, may say that society economic development  of  a\nCity-  may  enhance  the  value of  space  without  any	 the\nlittlest contribution by its owner and it is, in one  sense,\nunfair	that  society should pay to an individual  a  higher\nprice  not  because he has-earned it but  because  of  other\ndevelopmental factors.	Of course, we are concerned with the\nLand  Acquisition  Act as it is and this  thought  therefore\nneed not be pursued).  Counsel has also urged that the	land\nand the building taken together had a personality of its own\nand  therefore a special value, missed by the courts  below,\nshould	be ascribed and the methodology of breaking  up	 the\ntotality  into	buildings  and	lands  separately  This appeal, by certificate, arises out of land acquisition proceedings under the Hyderabad Land Acquisition Act (Hyderabad Act IX of 1309 Fasli) (hereinafter called the Act, for short) which substantially resembles the provisions of the Central Land Acquisition Act. The Government of Andhra Pradesh acquired a large open area with some buildings thereon by Notification, dated January 3, 1957 with a view to construct Income-tax add Central Excise Offices at Hyderabad. The contest before us is confined to the quantum of compensation and, although Shri Vasudeva Pillai, counsel for the appellants\' has pressed his points with persistence, we are unable to disturb the High Court\'s award. The land, vast in extent, had a building with a plinth area of 3,300 sq. yds. The area in which the acquired plot is situate is perhaps an important one in the City. After getting expert valuation made of the buildings by the Central Public Works Department engineers, the Collector awarded a sum of Rs. 41,674/- for the buildings, Rs. 1,440/- for the standing trees and a sum of Rs. 30,630/for a belt of land 50 ft. deep at Rs. 15/- per square yard and Rs. 99,435/- for the remaining area of 13,258 sq. yds. The, total figure together with statutory solarium granted by the Collector was Rs. 1,99,155.85. This figure fell far short of the ambitious claim of the appellant and, when the case came before the City Civil Court on a reference, there was an enhancement of compensation. Although the learned Additional Chief Judge held that the area was a little less than had been determined by the Collector, the market value of the building was increased nearly four fold on the basis of a multiple of 25 times the rent fetched. On the other items also some changes were made and, consequentially, the total amount was raised to Rs. 3,31,092/-. The appellant arrived in the High Court asking for more (and the State also appears to have appealed, but its appeal was dismissed and we are not therefore concerned with it). Some measure of good fortune attended the appeal since the High Court altered the multiple from 25 to 27 in fixing the compensation for the building. Otherwise, it substantially affirmed the findings of the trial Court, except that to the advantage of the appellant it restored the area acquired. The net result was the appellant obtained a total sum of Rs. 3,52,326.65 as compensation. It is thus clear that from the Collector to the Civil Court and on, to the High Court. there has been an escalation in the amount of compensation and, hopefully, the owner has reached this Court with his appeal, under a certificate which he secured under Art. 133(1)(a) before the recent amendment. Court mention this because court is unable to discern any substantial question of law of general importance in counsel\'s submissions or the points outlined in the memorandum of appeal which merits the consideration of this Court.\r\n\r\nHeld: Court is satisfied with the valuation of the rented portion of the house adopted by the High Court is correct. Shri Pillai argued in vain for an augmentation of the value on the potential user of the plot for a Cinema House. This story has been factually disbelieved by the Courts below and we cannot reopen the matter. Court must also remember that the Court below has been indulgent enough to adopt a multiple of 27 despite the fact that the buildings acquired are over 30 years old. Nor does it come with grace from the appellant to contend against the belting method since he himself had asked for its application before the Collector and the trial Court.\r\n\r\nCourt is thus satisfied that there is no law, no fact, which comes to the rescue of the appellant and his appeal, virtually against concurrent findings of fact, therefore deserves to be, and is hereby, dismissed with costs. ','Daya Singh Lahoria Vs Union Of India And Ors With\nSpecial Leave Petition (Crl.) Nos. 2697-2698  of 2000.\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nPATTANAIK,J.\nLITTTTTTTJ\n\n    The Writ Petition and the Special Leave Petitions raised\nthe common question, and as such were heard together and are\ndisposed  of by this common judgment.  The grievance of	 the\npetitioner Daya Singh Lahoria, in the Writ Petition is, that\nthe  Criminal Courts in the country have no jurisdiction  to\ntry  in respect of offences which do not form a part of	 the\nextradition  judgment by virtue of which the petitioner	 has\nbeen  brought  to this country and he can be tried only	 for\nthe  offences  mentioned  in the  Extradition  Decree.	 The\npetitioner  has	 also  prayed for quashing of  the  FIR	 and\ncharge	sheet  against	him which are not  included  in	 the\nextradition judgment of the USA Court.	It appears, that the\nUnited	States District of Texas Fort Worth Division  issued\nthe  judgment  of certification of extraditability  and	 the\nsaid  decree  certifies to sustain under Extradition  Treaty\nbetween	 the  United  States  and  the	United	Kingdom	 and\nNorthern  Ireland  with the Government of Republic of  India\nand  specifies the offences for which the accused, mentioned\nin  the	 extradition  order  could  be	tried.	 It  is	 the\ncontention of the petitioner that he cannot be tried for the\noffences   other   than	 the   offences	 mentioned  in	 the\nextradition  order  as	that  would be	a  contravention  of\nSection	  21  of  the  Extradition   Act  as  well  as	 the\ncontravention of the provisions of the International Law and\nthe very Charter of Extradition Treaty.\n\n    The	 Special Leave Applications are directed against the\norder of Rajasthan High Court wherein the High Court refused\nto  entertain  a  Habeas  Corpus  Petition  and	 decide	 the\nquestion  as  to  the jurisdiction of the  Designated  Court\nunder  the  provisions	of   the  Terrorist  and  Disruptive\nActivities  (Prevention)  Act, 1987, on the ground  that  an\nobjection  to  the  said jurisdiction could  be	 made  under\nSection	 18 of the Act before the very Designated Court	 and\nan application for issuance of a Writ of Habeas Corpus would\nnot lie.  The question for consideration in the said Special\nLeave  Petitions,  therefore, is whether an accused, who  is\nbeing  tried  in respect of offences under  the	 Extradition\nTreaty	can  be tried for any other offence which  does	 not\nform  a part of the decree in view of the specific provision\ncontained in Section 21 of the Extradition Act, 1962.\n\n    To	consolidate  and  amend	 the  law  relating  to	 the\nextradition of fugitive criminals and to provide for matters\nconnected  therewith, or incidental thereto, the Extradition\nAct of 1962 has been enacted.  Prior to the enactment of the\naforesaid  law of extradition applicable to India was  found\nscattered in the United Kingdom Extradition Act of 1870, the\nFugitive Offenders Act, 1881 and the Indian Extradition Act,\n1903.	The expression extradition means, surrender by one\nState  to  another of a person desired to be dealt with	 for\ncrimes	 of  which  he	has   been  accused  and  which	 are\njusticiable  in the Courts of the other States.	 The  rights\nof  a  citizen	not to be sent out to  foreign	jurisdiction\nwithout	 strict compliance with law relating to	 extradition\nis  a valuable right.  This Extradition Act is a special law\ndealing	 with criminals and accused of certain crimes and it\nprescribes the procedure for trial as well as the embargo in\ncertain contingencies.	The expression extradition offence\nhas  been  defined in Section 2 (c) of the Act to  mean,  in\nrelation  to  a	 foreign  State, being a  treaty  State,  an\noffence	 punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall\nnot  be	 less than one year under the laws of India or of  a\nforeign	 State	and  includes  a  composite  offence.	 The\nexpression  extradition Treaty has been defined in Section\n2(d)  to  mean, a treaty (agreement or arrangement) made  by\nIndia  with  a foreign State relating to the extradition  of\nfugitive  criminals and includes any treaty relating to	 the\nextradition  of fugitive criminals made before the 15th	 day\nof August, 1947, which extends to, and is binding on, India.\nThe  expression	 foreign State is defined in Section  2(e)\nincludes   any	State  outside	 India	and  includes  every\nconstituent  part,  colony  or	dependency  of	such  State.\nSection	 21  of	 the  Extradition Act is  relevant  for	 our\npurpose.\n\n    Section  21, as it stood in the Extradition Act of	1962\nis extracted hereinbelow in extenso:\n\n    Section 21:	 Accused or convicted person surrendered or\nreturned  by foreign State or Commonwealth country not to be\ntried  for previous offence:- Whenever any person accused or\nconvicted  of an offence, which if committed in India, would\nbe  an extradition offence, is surrendered or returned by  a\nforeign	 State	or Commonwealth country, that  person  shall\nnot, until he has been restored or has had an opportunity of\nreturning to that State or country, be tried in India for an\noffence	 committed  prior to the surrender or return,  other\nthan  the  extradition offence proved by the facts on  which\nthe surrender or return is based.\n\n    This  section  is  based  on Section 19  of	 the  United\nKingdom Extradition Act, 1870.	The original Act of 1962 was\namended	 by  Act  66  of  1993.	   Under  the  1962  Act,  a\ndistinction   had  been	  maintained  between	Commonwealth\ncountries  and	foreign States and the foreign	States	were\nconsidered   as	 treaty	 States.    The	  extradition	with\nCommonwealth  countries	 were  separately  governed  by	 the\nSecond	Schedule  of the Act and the Central Government	 was\ngiven	power	under  Chapter	 III  to  conclude   special\nextradition   arrangements  with   respect  to	Commonwealth\ncountries  only.   The amended Act of 1993 enables India  to\nconclude  extradition  treaty with foreign State,  including\nthe   Commonwealth   countries,	   without   treating	them\nstructurally  different.  It provides for  extra-territorial\njurisdiction  over  foreigners for crimes committed by	them\noutside	 India and it incorporates composite offences in the\ndefinition  of	extradition offence.  It excludes  political\noffences  as  a	 defence in cases of offences of  a  serious\nnature	and  it covers extradition requests on the basis  of\ninternational  convention.   It	 also  enables	the  Central\nGovernment  to	make  and receive requests  for	 provisional\narrest	of fugitives in urgent cases pending the receipt  of\nthe  formal extradition request.  Section 21 of 1962 Act was\nsubstituted by Act 66 of 1993, as follows:\n\n\n    Section 21	Accused or convicted person surrendered or\nreturned  by  foreign  State  not to be	 tried	for  certain\noffences.   - Whenever any person accused or convicted of an\noffence,   which,  if  committed  in   India  would  be	  an\nextradition offence, is surrendered or returned by a foreign\nState,	such person shall not, until he has been restored or\nhas  had an opportunity of returning to that State, be tried\nin India for an offence other than.\n\n    (a)	 the extradition offence in relation to which he was\nsurrendered or returned;  or\n\n    (b) any lesser offence disclosed by the facts proved for\nthe  purposes of securing his surrender or return other than\nan  offence in relation to which an order for his  surrender\nor return could not be lawfully made;  or\n\n    (c)	 the  offence in respect of which the foreign  State\nhas given its consent.\n\n    The	  provision   of  the	aforesaid   Section   places\nrestrictions  on  the trial of the person extradited and  it\noperates  as a bar to the trial of the fugitive criminal for\nany  other  offence  until the condition of  restoration  or\nopportunity  to return is satisfied.  Under the amended	 Act\nof 1993, therefore, a fugitive could be tried for any lesser\noffence,  disclosed  by	 the facts proved or  even  for	 the\noffence	 in respect of which the foreign State has given its\nconsent.   It thus, enables to try the fugitive for a lesser\noffence, without restoring him to the State or for any other\noffence, if the State concerned gives its consent.  In other\nwords,	it may be open for our authorities to obtain consent\nof  the	 foreign  State to try the fugitive  for  any  other\noffence	 for  which  the extradition decree might  not	have\nmentioned,  but	 without obtaining such consent, it  is	 not\npossible  to  try  for	any other offence,  other  than	 the\noffence	 for which the extradition decree has been obtained.\nThe  Extradition  Treaty contains several articles of  which\nArticle	 7 is rather significant for our purpose, which	 may\nbe quoted hereinbelow in extenso:-\n\n    Article 7.	A person surrendered can in no case be kept\nin  custody or be brought to trial in the territories of the\nHigh  Contracting Party to whom the surrender has been	made\nfor  any other crime or offence, or on account of any  other\nmatters,  than	those for which the extradition	 shall	have\ntaken  place,  until  he has been restored, or	has  had  an\nopportunity  of	 returning, to the territories of  the	High\nContracting Party by whom he has been surrendered.\n\n    This  stipulation  does n Removal Act, 1962 - Section 21 - an outlaw brought into this nation under an Extradition Decree can be attempted just for the offenses specified in the Extradition Decree and for no other offense and the Criminal Courts of this nation will have no purview to attempt such outlaw for whatever other offense. ','State Of T.N Vs Ananthi Ammal The Judgmenttt of the Court was delivered by S.P. BHARUCHA, J.-\r\n\r\nCivil Appeal No. 3312 of 1981\r\n\r\n1.This appeal by special leave is filed by the State of Tamil Nadu against the judgment and order of the High Court of Madras dated 9-9-1981, where by the Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for Harijan Welfare Schemes Act, 1978, was struck down as being ultra vires the Constitution of India. The High Court came to the conclusion that the said Act did not enjoy the protection of Articles 31-C or 31-A and that it was violative of Articles 14, 19 and 300-A of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n2.Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the said Act was not violative of Article 14 or Article 19 or Article 300-A and that, in any event, it was protected by reason of Article 31 A. Learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the said Act was violative of Article 14 inasmuch as it was enacted to acquire lands for a purpose which could as well be served by the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, and that a comparison of the provisions of the said Act with those of the Land Acquisition Act showed that the provisions of the said Act were far harsher insofar as the landowner was concerned. Learned counsel for the respondents also submitted that the said Act did not enjoy the protection conferred by Article 31-C notwithstanding the declaration in that behalf contained in Section 2 thereof.\r\n\r\n3.The said Act contains in Section 2 the declaration aforementioned, namely, that it is enacted to give effect to the policy of the State towards securing the principles laid down in Part IV and, in particular, Article 46 of the Constitution. It is enacted to provide for acquisition of land for Harijan Welfare Schemes.\r\n\r\n4.Section 3 of the said Act is the definition section. It defines &#39;Court&#39; to mean, in the city of Madras, the Madras City Civil Court and elsewhere, the Subordinate Judge&#39;s Court having jurisdiction, and if there is no such Subordinate Judge&#39;s Court, the District Court having jurisdiction. A &quot;Harijan Welfare Scheme&quot; is defined to mean any scheme for provision of house sites for Harijans, for constructing, extending or improving any dwelling house for Harijans, for providing any burial or burning ground for Harijans, for providing any pathway leading to such dwelling house, burial or burning ground or for providing any other amenity for the benefit of Harijans. Sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the said Act read thus:\r\n\r\n&quot;4. Power to acquire land.- (1) Where the District Collector is satisfied that for the purpose of any Harijan Welfare Scheme, it is necessary to acquire any land, he may acquire the land by publishing in the District Gazette a notice to the effect that he has decided to acquire the land in pursuance of this section. (2)Before publishing a notice under sub- section (1), the District Collector or any officer authorised by the District Collector in this behalf, shall call upon the owner or any other person, who, in the opinion of the District Collector or the officer so authorised may be interested in such land, to show cause why it should not be acquired. (3)(a) The District Collector may, where he has himself called upon the owner or other person to show cause under sub-section (2), pass such orders as he may deem fit on the cause so shown;\r\n\r\n(b)Where any officer authorised by the District Collector has called upon the owner or other person to show cause under sub- section (2), the officer so authorised shall make a report to the District Collector containing his recommendations on the cause so shown for the decision of the District Collector. After considering such report the District Collector may pass such orders as he may deem fit.\r\n\r\n5.Land acquired to vest in Government free from all encumbrances.- When a notice under sub-section (1) of Section 4 is published in the District Gazette, the land to which the said notice relates shall, on and from the date on which the notice is so published vest absolutely in the Government free from all encumbrances.\r\n\r\n6.Right to receive amount.- Every person having any interest in any land acquired under this Act shall be entitled to receive and be paid an amount as hereinafter provided.\r\n\r\n7.Determination of amount.- (1) The amount payable in respect of any land acquired under this Act shall be the market value of such land on the date of publication of the notice under sub-section (1) of Section 4.&quot; Section 8 sets out the matters that are to be ignored in determining the amount under Section 7. Section 9 entitles any person who does not agree with the amount determined by the prescribed authority under Section 7(2) to prefer an appeal to the &#39;Court&#39; within such period as may be prescribed. Sub-section (1) of Section 10 requires the prescribed authority to determine who, in his opinion, are entitled to receive the amount where several persons claim to be interested therein and what is payable to each of them. Sub- section (2) states that where a dispute arises in this behalf the prescribed authority may refer it for the decision of the court and the court must, in deciding such dispute, follow the provisions of Part III of the Land Acquisition Act. Section 11 reads thus: &quot;11. Payment of amount.- (1) After the amount has been determined, the prescribed authority shall tender payment of the amount to the persons entitled thereto and shall pay it to them-\r\n\r\n(i)in a lump sum in a case where it does not exceed two thousand rupees,and\r\n\r\n(ii)in all other cases, in such number of equal annual instalments not exceeding five as may be determined by the prescribed authority and the amount of each such annual instalment shall not be less than two thousand rupees: Provided that where the balance of the amount due in any instalment is less than two thousand rupees, only the actual amount so due shall be paid.\r\n\r\n(2)If the persons entitled to the amount do not consent to receive it or if there be no person competent to alienate the land, or if there be any dispute as to the title to receive the amount, or as to the apportionment of it, the prescribed authority shall deposit the amount in the Court, and the Court shall deal with the amount so deposited in the manner laid down in Sections 32 and 33 of the Land Acquisition &#39;Act, 1894 (Central Act I of 1894).&quot;\r\n\r\nSection 12 provides for payment of interest. It says that when the compensation amount is not paid or deposited on or before taking possession of the land, the prescribed authority shall pay it with interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the time of taking possession until payment. Section 13 reads thus:\r\n\r\n&quot;13. Appeal to High Court.- Subject to the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Central Act V of 1908) applicable to appeals from original decrees, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any enactment for the time being in force, a second appeal shall lie to the High Court from any decision of the Court under this Act, if the amount as determined by the prescribed authority exceeds such sum as may be prescribed.&quot;\r\n\r\nSection 20 states that the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, save as provided in the said Act, shall cease to apply to any land which is required for the purpose specified in Section 4(1) and such land shall be acquired only in accordance with the provisions of the said Act. Section 22 reads thus:\r\n\r\n&quot;22. Application of the Act to certain pending cases of acquisition.- (1) The provisions of this Act shall apply also to any case or cases in which proceedings have been started before the commencement of this Act for the acquisition of any land for the Harijan Welfare Scheme under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (Central Act I of 1894) (hereinafter in this section referred to as the said Act) but no award has been made by the Collector under Section 11 of the said Act before such commencement, as if-\r\n\r\n(i) the notification published under sub- section (1) of Section 4 of the said Act, or\r\n\r\n(ii)the declaration made under Section 6 of the said Act, or\r\n\r\n(iii)the notice given under sub-section (1) of Section 9 of the said Act, were a notice to show cause against the acquisition of the land served under sub- section (2) of Section 4 of this Act. (2)Nothing contained in sub-section (1) shall apply in relation to any land unless and until after&#39; the District Collector has published a notice in the District Gazette to the effect that the said land is required for the purpose specified in sub-section (1) of Section 4 of this Act.&quot;\r\n\r\n5. It was submitted by learned counsel for the respondents that no enquiry as required by Section 5 of the Land Acquisition Act was contemplated by the said Act. Whereas it was the Government which was required to consider objections and the need for acquisition and make a declaration thereafter that the land was required for a public purpose under the Land Acquisition Act, it was, under the said Act, left to the District Collector to be satisfied that the land was required for the purpose of a Harijan Welfare Scheme. No enquiry into the value of the land was contemplated under the said Act inasmuch as a provision equivalent to Section 11 of the Land Acquisition Act was not to be found in the said Act.\r\n\r\nWhereas the Land Acquisition Act set out the matters that were required to be considered for the purposes of award of compensation there was no such provision in the said Act. The said Act did not provide for a reference to the court in regard to a claim for enhancement of compensation in the manner of Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act; it provided only for an appeal to the court and, having regard to the terms of Section 9, that appeal was restricted to the amount of solatium payable under Section 7(2) of the said Act. Section 11 of the said Act provided for the payment of the compensation amount in instalments in the event that the amount thereof exceeded Rs 2000. Section 13 of the said Act provided for a second appeal to the High Court only if the amount as determined by the prescribed authority exceeded such sum as might be prescribed. This sum, it may be mentioned, was at the relevant time Rs.50,000, which was the amount prescribed for the purposes of all second appeals to the High Court under the rules for the purpose.\r\n\r\n6. In State of M.P v. G.C. Mandawar1 a Constitution Bench held that Article 14 does not authorise the striking down of the law of one State on the ground that, in contrast with the law of another State on the same subject, its provisions are discriminatory, nor does it contemplate the law of the Centre or of a State dealing with similar subjects being held to be unconstitutional by a process of comparative study of the provisions of the two. The sources of authority for the two being different, Article 14 can have no application. In Sant Lal Bharti v. State of Punjab2 this was reiterated.\r\n\r\n7. When a statute is impugned under Article 14 what the court has to decide is whether the statute is so arbitrary or unreasonable that it must be struck down. At best, a statute upon a similar subject which derives its authority from another source can be referred to, if its provisions have been held to be reasonable or have stood the test of time, only for the purpose of indicating what may be said to be reasonable in the context. We proceed to examine the provisions of the said Act upon this basis.\r\n\r\n8. Sub-section (1) of Section 4 empowers the District Collector, if he is satisfied that it is necessary to acquire some land for the purpose of a Harijan Welfare Scheme, to acquire that land by publishing in the District Gazette a notice to the effect that he has decided to acquire it in pursuance of Section 4. Sub-section (2) of Section 4 obliges the District Collector or any officer authorised by him in this behalf to call upon the owner or any other person who, in the opinion of the District Collector or the officer so authorised, is interested in such land to show cause why it should not be acquired. Where the District Collector has called upon the owner or other person to show cause under sub-section (2), clause (a) of sub-section (3) requires him to pass orders on the cause so shown. Where an officer authorised by the District Collector has called upon the owner or other person to show cause under sub-section (2), clause (b) of Section 3 requires that officer to report to the District Collector his recommendations on the cause so shown and the 1 (1955) 1 SCR 599 AIR 1954 SC 493 2 (1988) 1 SCC 366 (1988) 2 SCR 107 District Collector is required to pass such orders as he may deem fit after considering the report. Sub-section (2) of Section 4, therefore, obliges the acquiring authority to serve notice upon the landowner and other persons interested in the land to show cause why it should not be acquired. By reason of sub-section (3) of Section 4, such cause has to be taken into account and orders passed in respect thereof. It is only thereafter that the acquiring authority can arrive at the satisfaction that it is necessary to acquire the land. The provisions of Section 4, therefore, substantially encapsulate the provisions of Sections 4 to 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, the only major difference being that, under the said Act, it is the District Collector and not the State Government who must be satisfied that the land is required to be acquired. It does not appear to us that this is a provision whi ch is unreasonable or arbitrary.\r\n\r\n9.By reason of Section 5, the land in respect of which notice under Section 4(1) is published vests absolutely in the State\r\n This appeal by special leave is filed by the State of Tamil Nadu against the judgment and order of the High Court of Madras dated 9-9-1981, where by the Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for Harijan Welfare Schemes Act, 1978, was struck down as being ultra vires the Constitution of India. The High Court came to the conclusion that the said Act did not enjoy the protection of Articles 31-C or 31-A and that it was violative of Articles 14, 19 and 300-A of the Constitution. These civil appeals each party shall bear and pay its own costs.\r\n ','D.B. Madan Vs Commissioner Of Income-Tax JUDGMENT\r\n\r\n1. Heard learned counsel on both sides. Special leave granted.\r\n\r\n2. The High Court declined to call upon the Appellate Tribunal to state a case and refer a question of law said to arise out of the Tribunal&#39;s appellate order for its opinion. The circumstance that, in doing so, the High Court relied on a decision which in turn followed an earlier one in CIT v. T.S. Hajee Moosa and Co. (Mad) implied that a question of law did arise, but the question, in view of the earlier decision, was held as not a referable question of law. It is always open to the High Court to follow its earlier decision and answer the question of law one way or the other according as whether the view taken in the earlier case commends itself to it or whether, in its opinion, that earlier view needs reconsideration. But it cannot always be said that, in all cases where a similar question of law had been answered in an earlier case in a\r\n High Court declined to call upon the Appellate Tribunal to state a case and refer a question of law said to arise out of the Tribunal&#39;s appellate order for its opinion. The circumstance that, in doing so, the High Court relied on a decision which in turn followed an earlier one in CIT v. T.S. Hajee Moosa and Co. (Mad) implied that a question of law did arise, but the question, in view of the earlier decision, was held as not a referable question of law- Facts and circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was justified in holding that the expenditure on the air travel of the assessee&#39;s wife was not incurred wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the business of the assessee and that the benefit derived by the wife would detract from the exclusiveness of the outlay so as to render it ineligible as a deductible expenditure- Appeals are disposed of accordingly.\r\n ','Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd Vs Union Of India & Anr 63 at 69; Council v. Hindustan Co-operative Insurance Society Ltd., 58 I.A. 259, Ramswarup v. Munshi &amp; Ors. [1963] 3 SCR 858; Bolani Ores Ltd. v. State of Orissa, [1975] 2 SCR 138; referred to.\r\n\r\n(c) Section 55 is an instance of legislation by incorporation and not legislation by reference. In enacting s. 55 the legislature did not want to confer an unlimited right of appeal but wanted to restrict it. It found that the grounds set out in the then existing s. 100 CPC were appropriate for restricting the right of appeal and hence incorporated them in s.55. The legislature could never have intended to limit the right of appeal to any ground or grounds which might from time to time find place in s. 100 without knowing what those grounds were. [1063 B-D]\r\n\r\n(d) Secondly, the Act is a self-contained code and it is not possible to believe that the legislature could have made the right of appeal under such a code dependent on the viscititudes of a section in another statute. [1063 F]\r\n\r\n(e) That apart, an indissoluble link between s. 55 and s. 100, CPC would lead to a startling result. If, for example, s. 100 were repealed, s. 55 would be reduced to futility and the right of appeal under the Act would be wholly gone. It would be absurd to place on the language of s. 55 an interpretation which might in a given situation result in denial of the right of appeal altogether and thus defeat the plain object and purpose of the section. [1063 H]\r\n\r\n(f) Even assuming that the right of appeal under s.55 is restricted to the ground specified in the new s. 100 CPC the present appeal would still be maintainable because it involves a substantial question of law relating to the interpretation of s. 13(2) of the Act. [1064 D]\r\n\r\n(g) The test for determining whether a question of law raised in an appeal is a substantial question of law is to see whether it is of general public importance or whether it directly or substantially affects the rights of parties and if so whether it is an open question in the sense that it is not finally settled by this Court or by the Privy Council or by the Federal Court or is not free from difficulty or call for discussion of alternative views. [1064 E] Sir Chunilal V. Mehta &amp; Sons Ltd. v. The Century Spinning and Manufacturing Co. Ltd., [1962] Supp. 3 SCR 549; referred to.\r\n\r\nIn the present case the appeal clearly involves a substantial question of law within the meaning of the Act, because the interpretation of s. 13(2) directly and substantially affects the rights of the parties and is not finally settled by this Court.\r\n\r\n2(a) The words &quot;in the manner in which it was made-&#39; occurring in s. 13(2) have no bearing on the content or the scope and ambit of the power but merely indicate the procedure to be followed by the Commission in amending or revoking an order made by it. [1064 H]\r\n\r\n(b) The power conferred under s. 13(2) is of the widest amplitude and in this respect it is unlike s. 22 of the English Act. This power is intended to ensure that the order passed is and continues to be in conformity with the requirements of the Act, and the trade practice condemned by the order is really and truly a restrictive trade practices and it must therefore, be construed in a wide sense so as to effectuate the object and purpose of the grant of the power. [1065 B]\r\n\r\n(c) The powers under s. 13(2) and s. 55 are distinct and independent powers and one cannot be read as subject to the other. The scope and applicability of s. 13(2) is not cut down by the provision for appeal under s. 55. It is perhaps because the right of appeal given under s. 55 is limited to a question of law that a wide and unfettered power is conferred on the Commission to amend or revoke an order in appropriate cases. [1066 A]\r\n\r\n(d) The conferment of such wide and unusual power under s. 13(2) was necessary to ensure that an erroneous order is capable of being corrected. An order made under s. 37 or under any other provision of the Act may affect not only the parties before the Commission but also others such as the whole net-work of distributors or dealers who were not before the Commission. It may also affect the entire trade in the product. There may be some Facts or circumstances having a crucial bearing on the determination of the enquiry which, if taken into account, may result in a different order being made or some fact or circumstance may arise which may expose the invalidity of the order or render it bad. There may be a material change in the relevant circumstances subsequent to the making of the order. Therefore, by its very nature. the order of the Commission is transient or pro-tempore and must be liable to be altered or revoked according as there is material change in the relevant economic facts and circumstance. [1366 B-E]\r\n\r\n(e) But howsoever large may be the power under s. 13(2), it cannot be construed to be so wide as to permit a rehearing on the same material without anything more with a view to showing that the order was wrong on facts. [1067]\r\n\r\n(f) When Regulation 85 says that the provisions of s. 114 and O. XLVII, r. 1 CPC shall as far as may, be applied to the proceedings under s. 13(2) it cannot be read to mean that an application under s. 13(2) can be maintained only on the grounds set out in s. 114 and O. XLVII r. 1. This regulation does not in any manner limit the width and amplitude of the power under s. 13(2). A good part of it is procedural in nature and has nothing to do with the grounds on which an application under s. 13(2) may be maintained. The words &quot;as far as may&quot; occurring in its last part do not indicate that an application under s. 13(2) can be maintained only on the grounds set out in s. 114 and O. XLVII, r. 1, CPC. All that they indicate is that the provisions of s. 114 and O. XLVII, r. 1 are to be invoked only to the extent applicable, and if in a given case they are not applicable they may be ignored; but that does not mean that the power conferred under s. 13 (2) would not be exercisable in such a case. The reference to the provisions of s. 114 and O. XLVII, r. 1 does not limit the grounds on which an application may be made under s. 13(2). Clearly, therefore, even if a case does not fall within s. 114 and O. XLVII, r. 1, the Commission would have power in an appropriate case to amend or revoke an order made by it in the exercise of its power under s. 13(2). [1067 E-H] 3(a) The power of the Commission under s. 13(2) was exercisable in the present case and the order dated 14th May 1976 was liable to be revoked. [1077 B]\r\n\r\n(b) The submission of the distributorship agreement for registration under s. 33 cannot be construed as admission on the appellant&#39;s part that the clauses in the agreement constituted restrictive trade practices. The appellant had possibly submitted the agreement for registration on the erroneous view (which was also the view of the Commission in the Telco case) that the moment an agreement contains a trade practice falling within any of the clauses of s. 33(1) the trade practice must, irrespective of whether it falls within the definition of s. 2(o) or not, be regarded as a restrictive trade practice and the agreement must be registered. The question whether a particular trade practice is restrictive or not is essentially a question of law based on the application of the definition in s. 2(o) to the facts of a given case and no admission on a question of law can ever be used, in evidence against the make of the admission. Therefore, even assuming that there was an admission in submitting the agreement for registration it could not be used as evidence against the appellant in the enquiry under s. 37. [1075 C-G]\r\n\r\n(c) There was nothing in the conduct of the appellant which would amount to acquiescence or raise an estoppel against it. The appellant did not at any time, accept the impugned order knowing that it was erroneous. There can be no acquiescence without knowledge of the right to repudiate or challenge. [1068 H]\r\n\r\n(d) Neither did the failure of the appellant to prefer an appeal amount to acquiescence on its part because an application under s. 13(2), which is An alternative and a more effective remedy, was available to it. [1069 G]\r\n\r\n(e) The fact that the appellant did not implement the impugned order by entering into revised distributorship agreements with its distributors also showed that there was no acquiescence on its part so far as the order dated 14th May 1976 was concerned. [1070 C]\r\n\r\n(f) Estoppel can arise only if a party to a proceeding had altered his position on the faith of a representation or promise made by another. In the instant case there is nothing to show that the Registrar had altered his position on the basis of the application for extension of time made by the appellant. [1107 D] 4(a). The order of the Commission was bad because it was based on no material and, could not possibly have been made by the Commission. [1076 A-B]\r\n\r\n(b) The definition of restrictive trade practice in the Act is, to some extent, based on the rule of reason evolved by American courts while interpreting a similar provision in the Sherman Act. The rule of reason normally requires ascertainment of facts or features peculiar to the particular business, its condition before and after the restraint was imposed, the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable, the history of the restraint and the evil believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular restraint and the purpose sought to be attained. It is only on a consideration of these factors that it can be decided whether a particular act, contract or agreement imposing the restraint is unduly restrictive of competition so as to constitute restraint of trade. Certain restraint of trade are unreasonable per se because of their pernicious effect on competition and lack of any redeeming virtue; they are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and, therefore, illegal without elaborate enquiry as to the precise harm they have caused or the business execuse for their use. In such cases illegality does not depend on a showing of the unreasonableness of the practice and it is unnecessary to have a trial to show the nature, extent and degree of its market effect. [1074 A, B; 1075 A-B]\r\n\r\n(c) It is now settled law that every trade practice which is in restraint of trade is not necessarily restrictive trade practice. If a trade practice merely regulates and thereby promotes competition it would not fall within the definition even if it is to some extent in restraint of trade. Therefore, the question whether a trade practice is a restrictive trade practice or not has the decided not on any theoretical or a priori reasoning. but by inquirie whether it has or may have the effect of preventing distorting or restricting competition. The peculiar facts and features of the trade would be very much relevant in determining this question. [1072 H]\r\n\r\n(d) In the Telco case this Court laid down that an application by the Registrar under s. 10(a) (iii) must contain facts which in his opinion constitute restrictive trade practice and show or establish as to how the alleged clauses constitute restrictive trade practice in the context of the facts. But even if the application does not set out any facts or features showing how the trade practices complained of by the Registrar are restrictive practices, the Registrar can still, at the hearing of the enquiry, in the absence of any demand for particulars being made by the opposite party produce material before the Commission disclosing facts or features which go to establish the restrictive nature of the trade practice complained of and if that is done, the defect in the application would not be of much consequence. [1070 G-H] In the instant case the burden of producing the necessary material that the impugned trade practices had the actual or probable effect of diminishing or destroying competition and were therefore restrictive trade practices was on the Registrar who made on application before the Commission. No material beyond reproducing the impugned clauses of the agreement and the words of the relevant sections having been produced, the application of the Registrar was contrary to the law laid down by this Court. Therefore, the Commission had no basis for making its order dated 14th May 1976.\r\n\r\n(e) The argument that the trade practices referred to in the offending clauses were per se restrictive trade practices and in any event, even if any supporting material was necessary, it was to be found in the admission of the appellant contained in its letter submitting the distributorship agreement for registration was without any force.\r\n\r\n5(a). When the issue before the court is whether a practice trade practice set out in an agreement has or may have the effect of preventing, distorting or restricting competition so as to constitute a restrictive trade practice, it is the actual or probable effect of the trade practice which has to be judged and there is no question of contradicting, varying, adding to or substracting from the terms of the agreement by admitting extraneous evidence. The various factors stated earlier are required to be taken into account only for the purpose of determining the actual or probable effect of the trade practice referred to in the particular clause. In such a case it is not right to shut out oral evidence to determine the actual or probable effect of the trade practice. [1078 D-E]\r\n\r\n(b) It is not s. 33(1) which invalidates a clause in an agreement relating to a trade practice but it is the restrictive nature of the trade practice as set out in s. 2(o) which makes it void. [1079 E]\r\n\r\n(c) When a question of restrictive trade practice arises in relation to a clause in an agreement it is the trade practice in the clause that has to be examined for determining its actual or probable effect on competition. A clause in an agreement may proprio vigore impose a restraint. Where such restraint produces or is reasonably likely to produce the prohibited statutory effect it would clearly constitute a restrictive trade practice and the clause would be bad. [1108 D-E] Tata Engineering &amp; Locomotive Co. Ltd., Bombay,, v. The Registrar of the Restrictive Trade Agreement New Delhi, [1977] 2 SCR 685, applied.\r\n\r\nObservations in Hindustan Lever Ltd. v. M.R.T.P. [1977] 3 SCR 455; disapproved.\r\n\r\n(d) In a case where a clause in agreement does not by- itself impose any restraint but empowers the manufacturer or supplier to take some action which may be restrictive of competition, the mere possibility of action being taken, which may be restrictive of competition, would not in all cases affect the legality of the clause. What is required to be considered for determining the legality of the clause is whether there is a real probability that the presence of the clause itself would be likely to restrict competition. This is basically a question of market effect and cannot be determined by adopting a doctrainaire approach. Each case would have to be examined on its own facts from a business and commonsense point of view. It cannot, therefore, be said that in every case where the clause is theoretically capable of being so utilised as to unjustifiably restrict competition it would constitute a restrictive trade practice. [1081 E-H] 6(a). The order dated 14th May 1976 was clearly vitiated by an error of law apparent on the face of the record inasmuch as it contained only the final and operative order without giving any reasons in support of it. [1083 E]\r\n\r\n(b) The two conditions precedent before the Commission can pass a cease and desist order are (i) it must be found that the trade practice complained of is a restrictive trade practice and (ii) where such a finding is reached the Commission must be satisfied that none of the &quot;gateways&quot; pleaded in answer to the complaint exists. [1082 D-E]\r\n\r\n(c) In the instant case the appellant did not appear before the Commission and no &#39;gateways&quot; were pleaded and therefore the question of the Commission arriving at a satisfaction in regard to &quot;gateways&quot; did not arise. Nonetheless the Commission was required to be satisfied that the trade practices complained of were restrictive trade practices. The order dated 14th May 1976 did not contain any discussion showing that the Commission had reached the requisite satisfaction. It gave merely bald directions without any reasons. The ex-parte character of the order did not absolve the Commission from the obligation to give reasons in support of the order because the appellant would have been entitled to prefer an appeal even against on ex-parte order and in the absence of reasons, the appellant would not be in a position to attack the order in appeal. It is well established that every quasi-judicial order must be supported by reasons. [1082 E-H] N.M. Desai v. Textiles Ltd., C.A. 245 of 1970, dec. On 17th Dec., 1975; Simons Engineering Co. v.

Datar and Girish Chandra for Respondent No. 2.\r\n\r\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATI, J.-This appeal under section 55 of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) raises interesting questions of law relating to the interpretation and application of certain provisions of the Act. The facts giving rise to the appeal are for the most part undisputed and they may be briefly stated as follows:\r\n\r\nThe appellant is a public limited company engaged in manufacture and sale of jeep motor vehicles and their Spare parts and accessories. Since 1947 the appellant was marketing and distri-\r\n\r\nbuting jeep motor vehicles and it had set up a large and complex net work of dealers, who were described as distributors, for marketing and after sale service of such vehicles. In or about 1956 the appellant started manufacturing its own jeep motor vehicles and since then it has been manufacturing such vehicles and distributing and marketing the same through its net work of distributors. The appellant has appointed these distributors for marketing and sale of jeep motor vehicles on certain terms and conditions contained in a standard distributorship agreement. The material clauses of this agreement read as follows:\r\n\r\n&quot;Section (3): TERRITORY OF DISTRIBUTOR:-` The Company grants to Distributor the non-exclusive privilege (except as hereinafter provided) of selling at re tail and the right (except hereinafter provided) to appoint in writing by forms of agreements approved by the Company, Dealers to sell at retail the products enumerated in Section 2 of this agreement, within the following territory and also demarcated in the map attached hereto and which forms a part of this agreement.\r\n\r\nDistributor accepts the above retail setting privileges and agrees to develop with diligence the sales of sale products in said territory in accordance with this agreement and undertakes to achieve the quantum of sales in the territory as may be fixed by the Company from time to time.\r\n\r\nSection (4): LIMITATIONS ON TERRITORIAL RIGHTS:-\r\n\r\n(i) Distributor agrees not to solicit outside of the territory described in Section 3-the purchase of any products.\r\n\r\n* * * * Section (6): PRICE AND PAYMENT :-Distributor will pay for products the Company&#39;s established Distributor net prices in effect on date on despatch.

The allowance shall be made in respect of new and unused &#39;Jeep&#39; Motor Vehicles of the then current model in respect of which the price change has been made which `have been purchased by Distributor from the Company within a period of 30 (thirty) days prior to the effective date of such decrease in suggested list price, and which distributor shall have in his unsold stock on such effective date. The allowance shall be equal to the difference between the net amount paid to the Company for such &#39;Jeep&#39; Motor Vehicle (less all allowance thereto granted), and the net amount which would have been paid had such &#39;Jeep&#39; motor vehicles been purchased at the reduced price. No allowance, how ever, shall be made unless there is a reduction in the RETAIL list price and increases in discounts, bonuses and the like shall in no event be considered as a reduction in price.\r\n\r\n* * * * Section (17): CARE OF OWNER AND CUSTOMER RELATIONS :- Distributor agrees-\r\n\r\n* * * *\r\n\r\n(a) To refrain from selling or offering for sale any competing product. The Company shall be the sole judge as to whether a product is competing or not&quot;\r\n\r\nThe appellant by its letter dated 27th January, 1971 submitted to the Registrar of Restrictive Trade Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the Registrar) certified copies of agreements entered into by the appellant with the Distributors for registration, since in the opinion of the appellant, they were registrable under the provisions of Ch. V of the Act. The appellant also submitted to the Registrar along with its letter dated 19th May, 1972 four copies of the standard distributorship agreement for registration in terms of cl. (ii) of Rule 12 of the Monopolies Restrictive Trade Practices Rules, 1970 (hereinafter referred to as the Rules) and the standard distributorship agreement was registered by the Registrar under section 35 of the Act.\r\n\r\nOn 17th December, 1975 the Registrar made an application to 11 the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission (hereinafter referred to as the Commission) under section 10(a) (iii) of the Act pointing out to the Commission that the standard distributorship agreement entered into by the appellant with the distributors was filed by the appellant for registration in the office of the Registrar and the same had been duly registered under section 35 of the Act. The Registrar drew the attention of the Commission to clauses (3), (4), (5), (6), (11), (13), (14), (17) and (20) of the standard distributorship agreement and claimed that the provisions contained in these clauses related &quot;to restrictive trade practices relating to imposing restrictions on persons and classes of persons to whom goods are sold and from whom goods are bought tie-up sales/full-line forcing; exclusive dealing; granting or allowing concessions; discounts, over- riding commission, etc. in connection with or by reason of dealings; resale price maintenance; and allocation of area/market for disposal of products covered under the agreement, respectively attracting clauses (a), (b), (c),\r\n\r\n(e), (f) and (g) of section 33(1) and/or section 2(o) of the Act&quot; and that these restrictive trade practices had and might have the effect of preventing, distorting and restricting competition and tended to bring about monopolisation of prices and conditions of delivery and to affect the flow of supplies in the market relating to goods covered under the standard distributorship agreement in such manner as to impose on the consumers unjustified costs and restrictions and the same were prejudicial to public interest. The Registrar prayed on the basis of these allegations that the Commission be pleased to inquire into the restrictive trade practices indulged in by the appellant, under section 37 of the Act and pass such orders as it might deem fit and proper. The Commission, on receipt of this application, decided, in exercise of the powers conferred upon it under sections 10(a) and 37 of the Act, to hold inquiry into the restrictive trade practices complained of by the Registrar and issued notice dated 2nd January, 1976 under Regulation 53 of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission Regulations, 1974 (hereinafter referred to as the Regulations) to the appellant that if the appellant wished to be heard in the proceedings before the Commission, it should comply with the requirements of Regulations 65 and 67 failing which the Commission would proceed with the inquiry in the absence of respondent. The appellant, by its letter dated 3rd February, 1976, acknowledged receipt of the notice and intimated to the Commission that it did not wish to be heard in the proceedings before the Commission but put forward its submissions in regard to the restrictive trade practices alleged by the Registrar in his application. The appellant pointed out that the clauses of the standard distributionship agreement complained of by the Registrar did not constitute restrictive trade practices for the reasons explained in the letter and requested the Deputy Secretary to place their submissions before the Commission at the enquiry to be held by it. The letter was purported to be submitted in terms of Regulations 36(3), but the reference to this Regulation was obviously under some misapprehension because this Regulation occurred in Chapter V which provided the procedure for reference under Chapter III and IV and it had no application in case of an inquiry under section 37 of the Act. The Joint Secretary (Legal) of the Commission pointed out to the appellant by his letter dated 11th February, 1976 that if the appellant wished to be heard in the proceedings, the appellant should comply with the requirements of Regulations 65 and 67 and it is only if the appellant did so, that it could file a reply in answer to the application of the Registrar and moreover, the reply had to be properly drawn and duly verified and declared as provided in those Regulations. The Joint Secretary. (Legal) made it clear that in view of this legal position obtaining under Regulations 65 and 67, it was not possible to take note of contents of the letter addressed by the appellant setting out the explanation for the various clauses impugned in the application of the Registrar. Though this position, in law was specifically pointed out by the Joint Secretary (Legal) on behalf of the Commission, the appellant did not comply with the procedure set out in Regulations 65 and 67 with the result that the Commission decided to proceed exparte against the appellant. The Registrar filed an affidavit of the Assistant Registrar dated 10th May, 1976 in support of the allegations contained in the application but this affidavit surprisingly did not contain any further or other material than that set out in the application. No other evidence, oral or documentary, was produced by the Registrar and the Commission proceeded to decide the issues arising in the enquiry on the basis of the application supported by the affidavit of the Assistant Registrar. The Commission, after going through the application and the affidavit of the Assistant Registrar and hearing the Registrar, made an order dated 14th May, 1976, the operative part of which was in the following terms:\r\n\r\n&quot;(1) The Respondent is hereby restrained and prohibited by any agreement with any distributor to restrict by any method the persons or classes or persons to whom the goods are sold whether such person be retail purchaser or a dealer.\r\n\r\n(2) The Respondent is hereby restrained and prohibited from restricting in any manner, any purchaser whether a dealer or otherwise in the course of its trade from acquir-\r\n\r\ning or otherwise dealing in any goods other than those of the Respondent or the goods of any other person. (3) The Respondent is hereby restrained and prohibited from selling any goods to any distributor, dealer or other wise on the condition that the prices to be charged on resale by the purchaser shall be the prices stipulated by the respondent unless it is clearly stated that prices lower than those prices may be charged. The Respondent is hereby directed that in all future price lists it must state on the cover or on the front page that the prices if any indicated therein as resale prices are maximum prices and that the prices lower than those price may be charged.\r\n\r\n(4) The Respondent is hereby restrained and prohibited from allocating any area or market to any distributor or dealer for the disposal of the Respondent&#39;s goods. (5) The Respondent is hereby restrained and prohibited from preventing any distributor from appointing any dealer of its own choice on such terms and conditions as may be mutually agreed upon between distributors and dealers in cases where the Respondent does not undertake any obligation, liability or responsibility in respect of the dealers.\r\n\r\n(6) The clauses in the agreements relating to the above restrictive trade practices are hereby declared to be void. The practices arising therefore, shall be discontinued and shall not be repeated. (7) The Respondent shall within 3 months from the date of service of this order on it make and file an affidavit before the Commission setting out the manner in which this order has been given effect to. A copy of the said affidavit shall simultaneously be furnished to the Registrar.\r\n\r\n(8) There will be no order as to costs.&quot;\r\n\r\nSince the appellant was required to file an affidavit of compliance within three months as directed by cl. (7) of the Order, the appellant filed an affidavit dated 10th September, 1976 stating that the appellant had fully implemented in practice the directions contained in Paragraphs (1) and (5) of the Order and refrained from enforcing against the distributors any of the clauses which had been declared void by the Commission. The appellant also pointed out that a draft of a new distributorship agreement was being finalised by the appellant with a view to giving effect to the &quot;restrictions and prohibitions&quot; contained in the Order. The Registrar filed an affidavit of the Deputy Registrar dated 27th September, 1976 seeking particulars from the appellant showing how the appellant had implemented the directions contained in the Order. The appellant by its reply dated 11th November, 1976 pointed out that since the date of receipt of the Order, the appellant had not given effect to the trade practices covered by paragraphs (1) to (5) of the Order nor required any of the distributors to abide by the clauses of the standard distributorship agreement relating to those trade practices and on the contrary, intimated to the distributors that the old distributorship agreement would have to be substituted by a new revised agreement. The appellant submitted that since the clauses of the standard distributorship agreement declared void by the Commission were not enforceable in law by the appellant, it did not make any difference whether or not they were deleted from the existing distributorship agreement and in view of the fact that a new revised agreement was being prepared which would comply with the directions contained in the Order, it was not necessary, to effect any amendments in the existing distributorship agreement. It seems that there was a hearing before the Commission on this issue as regards compliance with the directions contained in the Order and the draft of the revised distributorship agreement prepared by the appellant was considered and pursuant to the suggestion made by the Commission, the appellant agreed to amend two clauses in the draft and the Commission by its Order dated 7th December, 1976 directed that the revised distributorship agreement should be filed by the appellant by 31st March, 1977.\r\n\r\nNow, it appears that subsequent to the Order of the Commission dated 7th December, 1976 an important decision was given by this Court in Tata Engineering &amp; Locomotive Co. Ltd., Bombay v. The Registrar of the Restrictive Trade Agreement, New Delhi(&#39;) relating to the interpretation of some of the relevant provisions of the Act bearing on restrictive trade practices. This decision was given in all appeal preferred by Tata Engineering Locomotive Co. Ltd. (herein- after referred to as the Telco against an order made by the Commission in an enquiry under section 37 and it reversed the view taken by the Commission in several important respects. Though this decision was given on 21st January, 1977, it was not fully reported until March 1977 and on reading it, the appellant felt that the order of the Commission dated 14th May, 1976 required reconsideration, as it was contrary to the law laid down in this decision. The appellant accordingly made an application to the Commission on 31st March. 1977 where, besides asking for extension of time for filing a copy of the revised distributorship agreement on the ground that the dealers were spread out all over India and it would take considerable time for execution of the revised distributorship agreement by them, the appellant pointed out that it had not contested the enquiry proceedings under section 37 in the first instance because the decision given by the Commission in the Telco case was directly applicable, but since that decision of the Commission was reversed by this Court in appeal, the appellant was advised to move a suitable application for amendment and/or modification of the Order dated 14th May, 1976 and that was also an additional reason why the time for filing the revised distributorship agreement should be extended, so that the revised distributorship agreement could be in accordance with the directions, if any. which might be given by the Commission on the proposed application. The Commission acceded to the request contained in this application and extended the time for filing the revised distributorship agreement upto 4th June, 1977.\r\n\r\nThe appellant thereafter made an application dated 30th May, 1977 under section 13(2) of the Act read with Regulation 85 for revocation, amendment or modification of the Order of the Commission dated 14th May, 1976. The appellant set out in this application various facts and features relating to its trade of manufacture and sale of Jeep motor vehicles and their spare parts and accessories and enumerated a number of grounds on which the order of the Commission dated 14th May, 1976 deserved to be revised, revoked, amended or otherwise modified. The application was opposed by the Registrar by filing a reply dated. 17th August, 1977. The parties were thereafter heard by the Commission on 26th August, 1977 and pursuant to the directions given by the Commission. affidavits of documents were filed and evidence was recorded on both sides. It appears that in the course of the evidence the appellant came to know that in November 1977 Hindustan Motors Ltd. had introduced in the 6 market diesel trekker which was clearly a competing vehicle and the appellant thereupon applied to the Commission on 30th January. 1978 for amendment of the application by adding a plea that the fact that since November 1977 Hindustan Motor Ltd. had started manufacturing and selling diesel trekker which was a highly competitive product was another material change in the relevant circumstances which justified the revocation, amendment or modification of the Order dated 14th May, 1976. This application for amendment was opposed by the Registrar on the ground that it was made at a very late stage of the proceeding. The Commission did not pass any order on this application for amendment and kept it pending and proceeded to dispose of the main application by an Order dated 28th February, 1978 by which it rejected the main application with costs and added a short order On the same day stating that in view of the order on the main application, there would be no order on the application for amendment. The appellant thereupon preferred the present appeal in this Court under section 55 challenging the validity of the order made by the Commission rejecting the application of the appellant.\r\n\r\nBefore we set out the rival contentions of the parties in the appeal, it would be convenient at this state to refer to the relevant provisions of the Act and the Regulations. Section 2 is the definition section and clause (u) of this section defines &#39;trade practice&#39; to mean &quot;any practice relating to the carrying on of any trade, and includes-(i) anything done by any person which controls or affects the price charged by, or the method of trading of, any trader or any class of traders (ii) a single or isolated action of any person in relation to any trade&quot;. &#39;Restrictive trade practice&#39; is defiled in section 2, clause (o) to mean &quot;a grade practice which has, or may have, the effect of preventing distorting or restricting, competition in any manner and in particular,-(i) which tends to obstruct the flow of capital or resources into the stream of production, or (ii) which tends to bring about manipulation of prices, or conditions of delivery or to affect the flow of supplies in. the market relating to goods or services in such manner as to impose on the consumers unjustified costs or restrictions.&quot; Section 5, subsection (1) provides for the establishment of the Commission which is to consist of a Chairman and not less than two and not more than eight other members to be appointed by the Central Government and sub- section (2) of section 5 lays down that the Chairman shall be a person who is or has been or is qualified to be a judge of the Supreme Court or of a High Court. It is obvious from these two sub-sections of section 5 that the Legislature clearly contemplated that the Commission must have a Chairman who would provide the judicial element and there must be at least two other members who would provide expertise in subjects like economics, law, commerce. accountancy, industry, public affairs or administration. so that there could be a really high-powered expert commission competent and adequate to deal with the various problems which come before it. It, however, appears that the Central Government paid scant regard to this` legislative requirement and though the office of Chairman fell vacant as far back as 9th August, 1976, it failed to make appointment of Chairman until 24th February, 1978. Of the two other members of the Commission one had already resigned earlier and his vacancy was also not filled with the result that the Commission continued with only one member for a period of about 18 months. This was a most unfortunate state of affairs, for it betrayed total lack of concern for the proper constitution and functioning of the Commission and complete neglect of its statutory obligation by the Central Government. We fail to see any reason why the Central Government could not make the necessary appointments and properly constitute the Commission in accordance with the requirements of the Act. It is difficult to believe that legal and judicial talent in the country had become so impoverished that the Central Government could not find a suitable person to fill the vacancy of Chairman for a year and a half. Moreover it must be remembered that the appointments, after all, have to be made from whatever legal and judicial talent is available and the situation is not going to improve by waiting for a year or two: a new star is not going to appear in the legal firmament within such a short time and the appointments cannot be held up indefinitely. Indeed, it is highly undesirable that important quasi-judicial or administrative posts should remain vacant for long periods of time, because apart from impairing the efficiency of the functioning of the statutory authority of the administration. inexplicable delay may shake the confidence of the public in the integrity of the appointments when made. Turning back to the provisions of the Act, we find that section 10(a) (iii) empowers the Commission to inquire into any restrictive trade practice upon an application made to it by the Registrar. The powers of the Commission while holding an enquiry under the Act are enumerated in section 12 and section 13, sub-section (2) provides that &quot;any order made by the Commission may be amended or revoked at any time in the manner in which it was made&quot;. Then follow sections 14 to 19 which deal inter alia with the procedure to be followed by the Commission. We are not concerned with Sections 20 to 32 which occur in Chapters III and IV because they deal with topics other than restrictive trade practices. Chapter V relates to registration of agreements relating to restrictive trade practices and it consists of sections 33 to 36 of which only sections 33 and 35 are material. Sub- section (1) of section 33 provides that any agreement relating to a restrictive trade practice falling within one or more of the categories specified there shall be subject to registration in accordance with the provisions of Ch. V and proceeds to enumerate the categories of restrictive trade practices covered by that provision and section 35 lays down the time within which an agreement falling within section 33, sub-section (1) shall be registered and the procedure to be followed for effectuating such registration. Sections 37 and 38 are the next important sections and they occur in Ch. V headed A &quot;control of certain restrictive trade practices&quot;. Sub-section (1) of section 37 provides that &quot;the Commission may inquire into any restrictive trade practice, whether the agreement, if any, relating thereto has been registered under section 35 or not, which may come before it for inquiry and, if after such inquiry it is of opinion that the practice is prejudicial to the public interest, the Commission may, by order, direct that-(a) the practice shall be discontinued or shall not be repeated, (b) the agreement relating there to shall be void in respect of such restrictive trade practice or shall stand modified in respect thereof in such manner as may be specified in the order&quot;. Section 38, sub-section (1) enacts that for the purposes of any proceedings before the Commission under section 37, a restrictive trade practice shall be deemed to be prejudicial to the public interest unless the Commission is satisfied of any one or more of the circumstances set out in that subsection and is further satisfied, after balancing the competing considerations, that the restriction is not unreasonable. These circumstances specified in sub-section (1) of section 38 render a trade practice permissible even though it is restrictive and provide what have been picturesquely described in the English law as &quot;gateways&quot; out of the prohibition of restrictive trade practices. Section 55 is the next relevant section and it provides that any person aggrieved by any order made by the Central Government under Ch. III or Ch. IV or as the case may be, of the Commission under section 13 or section 37 may, within 60 days from the date of the order, prefer an appeal to the Supreme Court on &quot;one or more of the grounds specified in section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908&quot;. This is the section under which the present appeal has been preferred by the appellant. The last section to which we must refer is section 66 which confers power on the Commission to make Regulations for the efficient performance of its functions under the Act. The Commission has, in exercise of the power conferred by this section, made the Regulations of which three arc material. namely, Regulations 65, 67 and 85. These Regulations, in so far as material, read as follows &quot;Section 65: APPEARANCE OF PARTIES : Every respondent who wishes to be heard in the proceedings shall within 14 days of the service upon him of the copy of the notice of enquiry, enter an appearance in the office of the Commission by delivering to the Secretary six copies of a memorandum stating that the respondent wishes to be heard in the proceedings and containing the name of his advocate having an office in Delhi or New Delhi and duly authorised to accept service of processes and the Secretary shall send one copy of the memorandum to the Registrar in case where proceedings are initiated under sub- clause (iii) of clause (a) of section 10, and in all other cases to the Director of Investigation.&quot; &quot;Section 67: REPLY TO THE NOTICE: Every respondent who has entered an appearance shall within four weeks of his entering appearance deliver to the Secretary a reply to the notice (5 copies) which shall include:-\r\n\r\n(a) particulars of each of the provisions of section 38 of Act on which he intends to rely; and\r\n\r\n(b) particulars of the facts and matters alleged by him to entitle him to rely on such provisions.&quot; &quot;Section 85: AMENDMENT OR REVOCATION OF ORDER ETC.: An application under sub-section (2) of section 13 of the Act for amendment-or revocation of any order made by the Commission in any proceedings shall be supported by evidence on affidavit of the material change in the relevant circumstances or any other fact or circumstances on which the applicant relies. Unless the Commission otherwise directs notice of the application together with copies of the affidavits in support thereof, shall be served on every party who appeared at the hearing of the previous proceedings and every such party shall be entitled to be heard on the application and the provisions of section 114 and Order XLVII of the Code of Civil Procedure, &#39;908 (5 of 1908), shall as far as may, be applied to these proceedings.&quot; It is against the background of these provisions of the Act and the Regulations that we have to determine the question arising for consideration in the appeal.\r\n\r\nThe contention of the appellant in support of the appeal was that the Order dated 14th May, 1976 suffered from various infirmities and was liable to be revoked or in any event modified under section 13(2) of the Act. It was said that the application of the Registrar on which the Order dated 14th May, 1976 was made did not set out any facts or features showing how the trade practices referred to in the application were restrictive of competition so as to constitute restrictive trade practices and merely contained a bald recital of the impugned clause and mechanical reproduction of the language of the relevant sections without anything more. The application of the Registrar was thus not in accordance with the law laid down in the decision of this Court in the Telco case and no order could be made upon it by the Commission. It was also urged that there was no material placed before the Commission by the Registrar on the basis of which the Commission could possibly come to the conclusion that the trade practices referred to in the application were restrictive trade practices. Even if the Commission was justified in proceeding exparte against the appellant, the highest that could be assumed in favour of the Registrar was that the facts set out in the application and the supporting affidavit of the Assistant Registrar would be deemed to be admitted, but, apart from the impugned clauses, no other facts were set out either in the application or in the affidavit of the Assistant Registrar and there was accordingly no evidence on which the order dated 14th May, 1976 could be made by the Commission. It was also contended that the Order dated 14th May, 1976 did not set out any facts peculiar to the trade of the appellant or the conditions before and after the imposition of the restraint or the actual or probable effect of the restraint nor did it indicate as to how the trade practices referred to in the impugned clauses constituted restrictive trade practices; it was a non-speaking order which did not give any reasons at all for holding that the trade practices complained of were restrictive trade practices and hence it was vitiated by a legal infirmity. The appellant further urged that the Order dated 14th May, 1976 was a continuing order as it required the appellant not merely to cease but also to desist from the restrictive trade practices set out in the order and it was, therefore, required to be continually justifiable and since the facts and features of the trade set out in the application of the appellant clearly established that the trade practices referred to in the impugned clauses did not constitute restrictive trade practices, the Order dated 14th May, 1976 was not justified and in any event could not be continued and it was accordingly liable to be revoked or amended under section 13(2). It was submitted that in any event the Order dated 14th May, l 976 was contrary to the law declared by this Court in the Telco case and since the decision in the Telco case was a fact or circumstance subsequent to the making of the Order, it justified the invocation of the power under section 13(2) for revoking or modifying the Order. Lastly, it was contended that in any view of the matter there was a material change in the relevant circumstances subsequent to the making of the Order dated 14th May, 1976 in that Hindustan Motor Ltd. started manufacturing and marketing competing utility vehicles since June 1976 and this was sufficient to warrant reconsideration of the Order under section 13 (2) . The respondents raised a preliminary objection against the maintainability of the appeal on the ground that under section 55 read with the newly substituted section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, an appeal could lie to this Court only on a substantial question of law and since the contentions raised on behalf of the appellant did not raise any substantial question of law, the appeal was not maintainable. The respondents also urged that on a proper construction of section 13(2) read with Regulation 85, the Commission could revoke or amend the Order dated 14th May, 1976 only if there was a material change in the relevant circumstances since the making of the Order or any of the grounds specified in Order XLVlI rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 was available to the appellant. The second and third grounds specified in Order XLVII, rule 1 obviously did not exist in the present case and the claim of the appellant for exercise of the power under section 13(2) could, if at all, rest only on the first ground, namely error of law apparent on the face of the record. But, said the respondents, there was no error of law apparent on the face of the record so far as the Order dated 14th May, 1976 was concerned, nor was there any material change in the relevant circumstances subsequent to the making of the order and hence section 13(2) was not attracted. The respondents contended that what the appellant was seeking to achieve by the application under section 13(2) was reconsideration of the Order dated 14th May, 1976 which was clearly impermissible, since section 13(2) could not be used as a substitute, for section 55 and that too, without the restrictive condition of that section. It was also urged on behalf of the respondents that, in any event the appellant was precluded from challenging the Order dated 14th May, 1976 by an application under Section 13(2) by reason of its subsequent conduct in acquiescing in the Order and unconditionally accepting the same. The appellant clearly waived the defects or infirmities if any in the Order dated 14th May, 1976 and was precluded from raising any contention against the validity of that Order. The respondents disputed validity of the contentions raised on behalf of the appellant and urged that in any event even if any of these defects or infirmities were present, they did not render the Order void as being without jurisdiction and hence the validity of the Order could not be challenged in the collateral proceedings under section 13(2). The respondents also contended that in any view of the matter the Order dated 14th May, 1976 was justified inasmuch as the trade practices complained of by the Registrar were restrictive trade practices. These were the rival contentions urged on behalf of the parties and we shall now proceed to examine The first question that arises for consideration in the preliminary objection of the respondents is as to what is the true scope and admit of an appeal under section 55. That section provides inter alia that any person aggrieved by an order made by the Commission under section 13 may prefer an appeal to this Court on &quot;one or more of the grounds specified in section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908&quot;. Now at the date when section 55 was enacted, namely, 27th December, 1969, being the date of coming into force of the Act, section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure specified three grounds on which a second appeal could be brought to the High Court and one of these grounds was that the decision appealed against was contrary to law. It was sufficient under section 100 as it stood then that there should be a question of law in order to attract the jurisdiction of the High Court in second appeal and, therefore, if the reference in section 55 were to the grounds set out in the then existing section 100, there can be no doubt that an appeal would lie to this Court under section 55 on a question of law. But subsequent to the enactment of section 55 section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure was substituted by a new section by section 37 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1976 with effect from 1st February, 1977 and the new section 100 provided that a second appeal shall lie to the High Court only if the High Court is satisfied that the case involves a substantial question of law. The three grounds on which a second appeal could lie under the former section 100 were abrogated and in their place only one ground was substituted which was a highly stringent ground, namely, that there should be a substantial question of law. This was the new section 100 which was in force on the date when the present appeal was preferred by the appellant and the argument of the respondents was that the maintainability of the appeal was, therefore, required to be judged by reference to the ground specified in the new section 100 and the appeal could be entertained only if there was a substantial question of law. The respondents leaned heavily on section 8(1) of the General Clauses Act, 1897 which provides:\r\n\r\n&quot;8(1) Where this Act, or any Central Act or Regulation made after the commencement of this Act, repeals and re-enacts, with or without modification, any provision of a former enactment, then references in any other enactment or in any instrument to the provision so repealed shall, un-\r\n\r\nless a different intention appears, be construed as references to the provision so re-enacted.&quot;\r\n\r\nand contended that the substitution of the new section 100 amounted to repeal and re-enactment of the former section 100 and, therefore, on an application of the rule of interpretation enacted in section 8(1), the reference in section 55 to section 100 must be construed as reference to the new section 100 and the appeal could be maintained only on the ground specified in the new section 100, that is, on a substantial question of law. We do not think this contention is well founded. It ignores the distinction between a mere reference to or citation of one statute in another and an incorporation which in effect means bodily lefting a provision of one enactment and making it a part of another. Where there is mere reference to or citation of one enactment in another without incorporation, section 8(1) applies and the repeal and re-enactment of the provision referred to or cited has the effect set out in that section and the reference to the provision repealed is required to be construed as reference to the provision as re-enacted. Such was the case in the Collector of Customs, Madras v. Nathella Sampathu Chetty &amp; Anr. and the New Central Jute Mills Co. Ltd. v. The Assistant Collector of Central Excise, Allahabad &amp; Ors. But where a provision of one statute is incorporated in another, the repeal or amendment of the former does not affect the latter. The effect of incorporation is as if the provision were written out in the incorporating statute and were a part of it. Legislation by incorporation is a common legislative device employed by the legislature, where the legislature for convenience of drafting incorporates provisions from an existing statute by reference to that statute instead of setting out for itself at length the provisions which it desires to adopt. Once the incorporation is made, the provision incorporated becomes an integral part of the statute in which it is transposed and thereafter there is no need to refer to the statute from which the incorporation is made and any subsequent amendment made in it has no effect on the incorporating statute. Lord Esher, M.R., while dealing with legislation in incorporation in In re. Wood&#39;s Estate (1886) 31 Ch.D. 607 pointed out at page 615:\r\n\r\n&quot;If a subsequent Act brings into itself by reference some of the clauses of a former Act, the legal effect of that, as has often been held, is to write those sections into the new Act.\r\n\r\njust as if they had been actually written in it with the pen, or printed in it, and, the moment you have those clauses in the later Act, you have no occasion to refer to the former Act at all.&quot;\r\n\r\nLord Justice Brett, also observed to the same effect in Clark v. Bradlaugh (1881) 8 Q.B.D. 63 at 69 :\r\n\r\n&quot; there is a rule of construction that, where a statute is incorporated by reference into a second statute, the repeal of the first statute by a third statute does no affect the second.&quot;\r\n\r\nThis was the rule applied by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Secretary of State for India in Council v. Hindustan Cooperative Insurance Society Ltd. The Judicial Committee pointed out in this case that the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 having been incorporated in the Calcutta Improvement Trust Act, 1911 and become an integral part of it, the subsequent amendment of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 by the addition of sub-section (2) in section 26 had no effect on the Calcutta Land Improvement Trust Act, 1911 and could not be read into it. Sir George Lowndes delivering the opinion of the Judicial Committee observed at page 267 :\r\n\r\n&quot;In this country it is accepted that where a statute is incorporated by reference into a second statute, the repeal of the first statute does not affect the second: see the cases collected in Craies on Statute Law, 3rd edn. pp. 349, 350.\r\n\r\n\r\n	  x		x	      x		     x\r\n	      x	   x   x    The independent existence of the\r\n\r\n\r\ntwo Acts is, therefore, recognized; despite the death of the parent Act, its offspring survives in the incorporating Act. x x x It seems to be no less logical to hold that where certain provisions from an existing Act have been incorporated into a subsequent Act, no addition to the former Act, which is not expressly made applicable to the subsequent Act, can be deemed to be incorporated in it, at all events if it is possible for the subsequent Act to function effectually without the addition.&quot;\r\n\r\nSo also in Ramswarup v. Munshi &amp; Ors., it was held by this Court that since the definition of &quot;agricultural land&#39; in the Punjab Alienation of Land Act, 1900 was bodily incorporated in the Punjab Pre-emption Act, 1913, the repeal of the former Act had no effect on the continued operation of the latter. Rajagopala Ayyangar, J., speaking for the Court observed at pages 868- 869 of the Report:\r\n\r\n&quot;Where the provisions of an Act are incorporated by reference in a later Act the repeal of the earlier Act has, in general, no effect upon the construction or effect of the Act in which its provisions have been incorporated.\r\n\r\nx x x x In the circumstances, therefore, the repeal of the Punjab Alienation of Land Act of 1900 has no effect on the continued operation of the Pre-emption Act and the expression &#39;agricultural land&#39; in the latter Act has to be read as if the definition in the Alienation of Land Act had been bodily transposed into it.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe decision of this Court in Bolani Ores Ltd. v. State of Orissa also proceeded on the same principle. There the question arose in regard to the\r\n Area 10(a) (iii) of the Monopolies and Restrictive Exchange Practices Act, 1969 empowers the Monopolies and Prohibitive Trade Practices Commission to enquire into any prohibitive exchange hones upon an application made to it by the Registrar of Restrictive Trade Agreements. Segment 13(2) gives that &quot;any request made by the Commission might be revised or repudiated whenever in the way in which it was made.&quot; Section 55 gives that any individual distressed by an arrange made by the Central Government or the Commission under s. 13 or s. 37 may incline toward an interest to the Supreme Court on one or more of the grounds determined in s. 100, Code of Common Procedure, 1908. On the date on which the Act came into drive s. 100 C.P.C. indicated three grounds on which a moment bid could mislead the High Court one of them being that the choice claimed against was opposite to law. By an correction made in 1976 s.100 was substituted by a new segment which gives that a moment bid should deceive the High Court just if the High Court is fulfilled that the case includes a considerable question of law. The appealing party, who was a producer of jeep engine vehicles, their save parts and embellishments, submitted for enrollment to the Registrar of Restrictive Trade Understandings, standard distributorship assentions went into by it with its merchants. After registering the understandings, in his application to the Commission, the Enlistment center charged that certain conditions in the assention identified with prohibitive exchange rehearses and that some of them were biased to open intrigue. The litigant, in answer to the Commission&#39;s notice, expressed that it didn&#39;t wish to be heard in the procedures prior to the Commission, bringing up while there was nothing in the decried provisions of the understanding which could be said to constitute prohibitive exchange hones the reasons whereof had as of now been clarified in its answer. 1039 The Registrar documented before the Commission a testimony in support of his application yet that too did not contain any further or extra material than what was set out in his application. No other confirmation, oral or narrative, was delivered by him before the Commission in support of the affirmation that the agreement constituted a prohibitive exchange rehearse. By its request dated May 14, 1976 the Commission pronounced certain provisions of the litigant&#39;s distributorship assention to be void. While correspondence was going on between the Enlistment center and the litigant on the accommodation of a changed distributorship understanding, this Court in Tata Engineering and Train Co. Ltd. v. Enlistment center of Restrictive Trade Rehearses, [1977] 2 SCR 685 gave its understanding on the pertinent arrangements of the Act. Immediately the appealing party made an application to the Commission calling attention to that it did not challenge the enquiry procedures under s. 37 in the first occasion in light of the fact that the Commission&#39;s choice in the Telco case was specifically pertinent; yet now that that choice had been turned around by the Supreme Court in request, its request dated May 14, 1976 required correction/change. An application under s. 13 (2) read with control 85 was in like manner made for denial, correction or modification of the Commission&#39;s request of May 14, 1976. The Commission rejected this application by a request dated 28th February 1978. In its allure under s. 55 of the Act impugning the Commission&#39;s request dated 28th February 1978 the appealing party battled that (1) the Registrar&#39;s application claiming prohibitive exchange hones did not set out any actualities demonstrating how the litigant&#39;s exchange practices were prohibitive in nature and that the Registrar&#39;s application not having been made as per the law set around this Court in Telco case the denounced arrange of the Commission was subject to be denied or adjusted under s. 13(2); (2) the request did not give any purposes behind its choice as was vitiated; and (3) the order was a proceeding with request in light of the fact that it required the appealing party not merely to stop but also cease from the prohibitive exchange rehearses set out in the arrange and was, in this way required to be persistently reasonable and since it was, in opposition to the law set down in Telco case it was at risk to be repudiated or revised; in any occasion the choice of this Court being ensuing to the making of the Commission&#39;s order, there was sufficient legitimization for repudiating or modifying the request under s. 13(2) of the Act. The respondent, then again, battled that (1) on a use of the control of understanding authorized in s. 8(1) or the General Clauses Act, reference in s. 55 to s. 100 C.P.C. must be understood as a kind of perspective to the new s. 100, C.P.C. thus understood an interest to the Supreme Court would lie just if the case included &quot;a considerable question of law&quot; and not generally and since for this situation no such question was included, the interest was not viable; (2) s. 13(2) couldn&#39;t be utilized by the litigant as a substitute for s. 55; and (3) by reason of its consequent lead in assenting in the Commission&#39;s request and genuinely tolerating it, the litigant was blocked from raising any dispute against its legitimacy in offer to this Court. Permitting the interest, ^ HELD: The appeal is viable under s. 55 of the Act. [1064 C] 1(a) On a legitimate understanding of s. 55 it must be held that the grounds speci- 1040 fied in the then existing s. 100 CPC were joined in s. 55 and the substitution of the new s. 100 did not influence or confine the grounds as joined in s. 55. In any occasion, the present interest brings up generous issues of law, and so is viable. [1064 C] (b) There is a refinement between a unimportant reference to then again reference of one statute in another and a consolidation. Where there is a minor reference to or reference of one establishment in another without consolidation, s. 8(1) of the General Clause Act applies and the annulment and re-order of the arrangement alluded to or refered to has the impact set out in that area and the reference to the arrangement canceled is required to be interpreted as reference to the arrangement as re-established. In any case, where a provision of one statute is consolidated in another, the annulment or revision of the former does not influence the last mentioned. The effect of consolidation is as though the arrangement incorporated were worked out in the incorporting statute and were a piece of it. Once the consolidation is made, the arrangement joined turns into an indispensable part of the statute in which it is transposed and thereafter there is no compelling reason to allude to the statute from which the consolidation is made and any resulting change made in it has no impact on the consolidating statute.

','Shamkant Narayan Despande Vs Maharashtra Industrial CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Special Leave petition (c) No.\n4748 of 1991.\nFrom the Judgment and Order dated 21.1.91 of the Bombay High\nCourt in W.P. No. 3481 of 1990.\nN.B. Shetye,  P.M.  Pradhan  and  A.M.	khanwilkar  for	 the\npetitioner.\nDushyant Dave, Beliram Vakil, Abrar Ali, Ajit Yogi, Gajender\nLal, Mukul Gupta and Ms. Sonia Khan for the Respondents.\nThe Judgment of the court was delivered by\n     SAWANT,  J.   The	petitioner  is	diploma-  holder  in\nEngineering  and holds the post of Executive Engineer in the\nrespondent-Corporation. Till 1974, the promotion post of the\nsuperintending Engineer	 was  available	 both  for  diploma-\nholders and degree-holders according to merit-cum-seniority.\nThis was  so according	to  the	 practice  followed  by	 the\nCorporation without  making any	 rules or regulation in that\nbehalf. In  1974, the corporation made regulation by passing\na resolution  by passing a resolution and continued the same\npractice. Admittedly,  the regulation  were not	 made  under\nsection 64  of the  Maharashtra Industrial  Development Act,\n1961 [hereinafter  referred to as the &apos;Act&apos;] under which the\nrespondent-corporation was  created. Thereafter in 1988, the\ncorporation passed a resolution, for the first time,. making\n75 per	cent of	   the	posts  of  superintending  engineers\navailable to  the executive Engineers holding degrees and 25\nper cent  to  the  Executive  Engineers	 who  were  diploma-\nholders.  This	 resolution  was   also	 admittedly   not  a\nregulation made	 under the   said  section 64.	But for this\nresolution, the	 petitioner who was senior to respondent NO.\n2 would	 have been  promoted to	 the post  of Superintending\nEngineer on  31st October,  1990. However,  since respondent\nNo.2 was a degree holder, he got the said resolution and was\npromoted to the said post on that date. It is this promotion\nwhich was challenged by the petitioner by a writ petition in\nthe High  Court. The  High Court  by the  impugned  judgment\ndismissed the said petition.\n     2.	 Two   contentions  were  raised\n     before us.\n     (i) that no classification could be\n     made among	 the Executive Engineers\n     on the  basis of  their educational\n     qualification for	the  purpose  of\n     promotion	 to    the    post    of\n     superintending Engineer, since they\n     belong  to	  the  same   cadre   of\n     Executive Engineers and do the same\n     work.  There   was	 also  a  common\n     seniority	  of	the    Executive\n     Engineers	maintained.   hence  the\n     classification  was  discriminatory\n     in nature and violative of Articles\n     14 and 16 of the Constitution .\n     (ii)  that	  if  at   all	such   a\n     discrimination was	 permissible, it\n     could be  made only  be a statutory\n     rule  or  regulation  framed  under\n     Section 64	 of the said Act. A mere\n     resolution	   or	 an    executive\n     instruction could	not effect  such\n     discrimination.\n3.   We find  not merit in either of the two contentions. It\nis now	well settled  that for	the purpose  of promotion, a\nvalid classification  can made among the members holding the\nsame post  on the  basis of their qualification. In state of\nJummu &amp;	 Kashmir v.  Triloki Nath Khosa &amp; Ors., [1974] 1 SCR\n771, a Constitution Bench of his court has clearly held that\nsuch a	classification is  permissible and  does not violate\nArticles 14  and  16  of  the  Constitution  the  Court	 has\nobserved there that in state of Mysore &amp; Anr. v. P. Narasing\nRao, [1968]  1 SCR  407 and The Union of India and others v.\nDr.(Mrs.) S.B.	Kholi, AIR  1973 SC 811, it was already held\nthat   classification	 on   the   basis   of	 educational\nqualification was  permissible. The  Court then	 referred to\nRoshan Lal  Tandon v.  Union of India, [1968] 1 SCR  185 and\ndistinguished it  on the facts by pointing out that it was a\ncase of	 the direct  recruits and  promotees integrated into\none cadre.  Once they  were integrated they lost their birth\nbirth-marks, viz.  the different   sources  from which	they\nwere recruited.	 [Emphasis supplied].  The court pointed out\nthat Roshan Lal&apos;s case [supra] was thus no authority for the\nproposition that  if direct  recruits  and    promotees	 are\nintegrated into	 one class  they cannot	 be  classified	 for\npurposed of promotion on a basis other than that in the case\nbefore the them the classified for purpose of promotion on a\nbasis  other  than  that  they	were  drawn  from  different\nsources. The  court also  pointed out  that the	 very  Bench\nwhich decided  Roshan Lal&apos;s    case  [supra]  he Constitution of India, Art.14, Art.16 - Promotion to post of Superintending Engineer - Classification of degree-holder and confirmation holder Executive Engineers - Not violative Arts. 14 and 16. \r\n\r\nMaharashtra Industrial Development Act (3 of 1962), S.64. \r\n\r\nAIR 1983 SC 881, Held per incuriam. \r\n\r\nAIR 1974 SC 1, Foll. \r\n\r\nAdvancement - Classification among same class on premise of capabilities - Permissible. \r\n\r\nMaharashtra Industrial Development Act (3 of 1962), S.63 - Promotion to post of Superintending Engineer - Classification of degree holder and confirmation holder Executive Engineers - Made by Corporation by passing simple determination - Not illicit. \r\n\r\nAuthoritative law - Change in administration condition by passing simple determination - allowable. \r\n\r\nStates of Service - Can be changed by official guidelines.\r\n\r\nheld: The proposition that in the absence of the rules and regulations, the authority can act by executive instruction finds direct support in Mysore state Road Transport Corporation v.

The  learned  single  Judge  of the  High \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCourt,   by   order   dated   24.11.1976,     quashed   the   order   dated \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n01.05.1973   and   directed   that   in   case   the   State   wants   to \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreopen   the   order   dated   23.04.1969,   it   can   do   so   by   giving \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproper opportunity of hearing to the petitioners therein.   After \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe aforesaid judgment, on 25.03.1978, a notice was served on \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe respondents by the PHED stating that it wanted to get the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nland   back   from   the   respondents   which   had   been   restored   to \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem for its own use and order dated 23.04.1969 was sought \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto   be   recalled.     It   was   also   stated   that   the   respondents   are \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nliable   to   be   evicted   from   the   land   in   question.     The \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nrespondents filed objections against the notice for recalling the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norder dated 23.04.1969.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(e)    Since the notice for recalling the order dated 23.04.1969 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas not been formally dropped, the respondents filed a suit in \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   Court   of   Munsif   and   Judicial   Magistrate,   Jodhpur   City, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJodhpur.   The Munsif Magistrate, by order dated 30.06.1982, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndecreed   the   suit   restraining   the   State   Government   from \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmaking   any   alterations   in   the   contract   that   has   come   into \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexistence in pursuance of the order dated 23.04.1969.  Notices \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere   sent   to   the   respondents   to   appear   before   the   Revenue \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister   as   the   Revision   Petition   for   cancellation   of   the   plot \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngranted in the year 1969 was pending before him.  The parties \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappeared   before   the   Revenue   Minister.     By   order   dated \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15.12.1992,   the   Revenue   Minister   cancelled   the   order   dated \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23.04.1969. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(f)    Challenging   the   order   of   the   Revenue   Minister,   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrespondents   filed   a   petition   being   W.P.   No.   1526   of   1993 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbefore  the  High  Court.     The  learned  single  Judge  of the  High \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCourt, by order dated 19.03.2002, allowed the same.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n(g)    Against   the   said   judgment,   the   State   filed   D.B.   Civil \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial Appeal (W) No. 270 of 2002 and the respondents also \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfiled   cross   objections   before   the   High   Court.     The   Division \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBench   of   the   High   Court,   by   impugned   judgment   dated \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14.10.2003,   dismissed   the   appeal   filed   by   the   State   and \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nallowed the cross objection filed by the respondents herein.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(h)    Aggrieved   by   the   said   order   of   the   Division   Bench,   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nState Government filed these appeals before this Court by way \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof special leave petitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(3)    Heard   Dr.   Manish   Singhvi,   learned   counsel   for   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappellants,   Mr.   Dipankar   Gupta,   learned   senior   counsel   for \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrespondent   Nos.   1-6   and   Ms.   Bhati,   learned   counsel   for   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nintervenor.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(4)    The   main   issue   in   these   appeals   is   about   the   grant   of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n460.15   bighas   of   land   on   23.04.1969   by   the  PHED  to   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrespondents   herein.     As   far   as   the   remaining   land   of   143 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbighas   is   concerned,   even   the   Division   Bench   of   the   High \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCourt,   in   the   impugned   order,   remitted   the   matter   to   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRevenue Minister.  Inasmuch as the issue of remaining land of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n143   bighas   raised   by   the   respondents   is   pending   before   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nRevenue   Minister,   the   same   is   not   relevant   for   our   present \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(5)    It   is   the   contention   of   the   learned   counsel   for   the   State \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   the   order   dated   23.04.1969   about   the   grant   of   603.16 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbighas of land (including 460.15 bighas - the subject matter of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npresent proceedings) was ex facie without jurisdiction as it was \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nallotted   by   the  PHED  on  flimsy   and  fallacious   grounds  about \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncancellation   of   patta   way   back   in   the   year   1942   and   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompensation sought in the year 1968.   It is relevant to note \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat the same was cancelled way back in 1973.   Inasmuch as \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopportunity of hearing was not given, the learned single Judge \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof the High Court, by order dated 24.11.1976, remanded back \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto the State Government for     deciding the matter afresh after \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngiving due opportunity of hearing to the respondents herein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(6)    On   behalf   of   the   State,   it   was   pointed   out   that   it   has \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlegitimate   grievance   with   the   allotment   dated   23.04.1969   by \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  PHED.     The cancellation was made way back in the year \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1942   for   allotment   made   in   the   year   1941   on   the   ground   of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nviolation   of   lease   conditions.     The   respondents   have   claimed \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhuge   compensation   for   construction   said   to   have   been   made \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nduring   subsistence   of   lease   in   the   year   1949   itself   and   filed \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplication for compensation with regard to the cancellation of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npatta   in   the   year   1968.     According   to   the   State,   the   said \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplication   was   barred   by   limitation   and   it   was   also   filed \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbefore wrong forum, i.e., the PHED, when it should have been \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfiled   before   the   Land   Revenue   Department,   which   is   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappropriate Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(7)    It   is   also   the   grievance   of   the   State   that   the   allotment \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndated 23.04.1969  was cancelled on 01.05.1973,  however, the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHigh   Court   set   aside   the   same   on   24.11.1976   on   the   limited \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nground that there was violation of natural justice and directed \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   State   Government   to   decide   it   afresh   after   giving \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopportunity   of   hearing.     In   those   circumstances,   the   State \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwants to exercise its power under the Land Revenue Act read \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith the orders passed by the learned single Judge of the High \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCourt   dated   24.11.1976   and   the   Revenue   Minister   dated \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15.12.1992.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(8)    It   was   highlighted   that   the   judgment   of   the   trial   Court \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndated 30.06.1982 is also nullity since there was no discussion \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non   merits   with   regard   to   the   validity   of   allotment   dated \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n23.04.1969. Though it was pointed out by the counsel for the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrespondents that it was hit by the principle of  res judicata  as \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclarified by the counsel for the appellants, the principle of  res  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njudicata shall only apply if there is discussion or finding on the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsame   subject   matter.     A   perusal   of   the   decree   of   injunction \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   had   been   passed   on   23.04.1969   shows   that   it   did   not \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadvert to the merits of the case at all.  It is also not in dispute \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   the   subject   Property - Notice for reviewing - Objections against the notice for reviewing the request permitted by High Court - Hence, introduce claim - Held, arrive being referred to has a place with the Revenue Department of the State of Rajasthan and the PHED had no purview at all to reestablish 460.15 bighas of land for the Respondents - It was unnecessary to specify that while passing crisp requests as coordinated, the State Government needed to issue notice to every one of the gatherings concerned and choose the same as per law - Appeals permitted. Appeals Allowed','Dahyabhai Ranchhoddas Dhobi &amp; Anr Vs State Of Gujarat &amp; Ors P. Sathasivam, J.\n\n1) Leave granted.\n\n2) This appeal is directed against the judgment and order\n\ndated 12.01.2009 passed by the High Court of Gujarat at\n\nAhmedabad in Special Civil Application No. 5663 of 1990\n\nwith Civil Application No. 3458 of 2006 whereby the High\n\nCourt dismissed the petition preferred by the appellants\n\nherein.\n\n\n\n\n \n3) Brief facts:\n\na)   According to the appellants, they are owners of the\n\nland in question measuring 848.66 sq.m., Nandh No.\n\n2190/P, Ward No.4 of Surat City.        The State of Gujarat\n\ninitiated   acquisition   proceedings    under   the   Land\n\nAcquisition Act, 1894 (hereinafter referred to as the \"Act\")\n\nfor construction of a school in the land in question under\n\nthe Surat Municipal Corporation. The appellants objected\n\nto the said acquisition on the ground that:\n\n(i) this is the only land for them for carrying on the\n\nbusiness of washermen and they are using this land for\n\nthe purpose of their livelihood.\n\n(ii) There are vacant/open lands adjoining to the land in\n\nquestion.\n\n(iii) Within a radius of 1 km., number of schools are\n\navailable particularly being run by the Surat Municipal\n\nCorporation.\n\n\n\n\n \n(iv) While acquiring the land, the respondents have not\n\nfollowed the provisions of Sections 4, 5, 6 and 11A of the\n\nAct.\n\nb)     On the other hand, it is the stand of the State\n\nGovernment that:\n\n(i) the land is required for establishing a primary school by\n\nthe Surat Municipal Corporation.\n\n(ii) They fully complied with the statutory notices and\n\nother requirements.\n\n(iii) The appellants did not avail the opportunity of\n\nparticipating in the 5A enquiry by filing objections.\n\n(iv) The declaration made under Section 6 of the Act is\n\nwithin time.\n\n(v) Award under Section 11A has been passed within the\n\nstatutory period. Since the establishment of school is for\n\na public purpose and in view of compliance of all the\n\nstatutory formalities, there is no merit in the appeal and\n\nprayed for dismissal of the same.\n\n\n\n\n \n4)   Heard Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel for\n\nthe appellants and Mr. Prashant G. Desai, learned senior\n\ncounsel for the Surat Municipal Corporation and Ms.\n\nHemantika Wahi, learned counsel for the State of Gujarat.\n\n5)   Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel for the\n\nappellants has raised the following contentions:\n\na)   there was no hearing/enquiry in terms of Section 5A\n\nof the Act which is mandatory;\n\nb)   the locality publication was not effected under\n\nSection 6(2);\n\nc)   the Award passed under Section 11A was not made\n\nwithin two years from the date of last publication of\n\nnotification under Section 6, therefore the acquisition is\n\nvitiated;\n\nd)   after change of classification of the land in question,\n\nnamely, residential use, the respondents are not permitted\n\nto establish a primary school which is not permissible;\n\ne)   In view of the fact that the area being designated as\n\nresidential congested by houses on either side, it is not a\n\n \nfit place for establishing a school as observed by this\n\nCourt in Avinash Mehrotra vs. Union of India and\n\nOthers, (2009) 6 SCC 398.\n\n6)   On the other hand, Mr. Prashant G. Desai, learned\n\nsenior counsel for the Surat Municipal Corporation has\n\nsubmitted that in view of Section 12 (2) (b) and Section 20\n\n(1) of the Gujarat Town Planning &amp; Urban Development\n\nAct, 1976, the State Government is well within their\n\npowers in establishing a primary school in Surat.       He\n\nfurther submitted that all the statutory provisions have\n\nbeen strictly complied with and the declaration under\n\nSection 6 and Award under Section 11A were duly made\n\nwithin the prescribed time. Ms. Hemantika Wahi, learned\n\ncounsel appearing for the State, by drawing our attention\n\nto specific averments in the counter affidavit submitted\n\nthat the appellants having not filed objections in the\n\nenquiry under Section 5A, all the three modes of\n\npublication as contemplated under Section 6 were duly\n\npublished and made and Award passed within the\n\n \nprescribed period, there is no infirmity in the acquisition\n\nproceedings and prayed for dismissal of the appeal.\n\n7)   We    have    considered     the   rival   contentions   and\n\nperused the relevant materials.\n\n8)   With regard to the first objection as to enquiry under\n\nSection 5A of the Act though the appellants have stated\n\nthat they were not given an opportunity of being heard, in\n\nthe counter affidavit filed by the Special Land Acquisition\n\nOfficer,   Surat   before   the   High    Court    it   has   been\n\nspecifically asserted that notification under Section 4 in\n\nthe Official Gazette was published on 09.03.1989, public\n\nnotice displayed at the office of Mamlatdar of the\n\nconcerned Ward on 20.04.1989 and hearing of objections\n\nunder Section 5A was fixed on 20.05.1989. In para 4 of\n\nthe counter affidavit, the Land Acquisition Officer has\n\nspecifically stated that appellants were given several\n\nopportunities for hearing their objections from time to\n\ntime. The hearing was fixed on 29.05.1989, 05.06.1989,\n\n12.06.1989, 20.09.1989, 28.09.1989 and 16.10.1989 and\n\n \nthe appellants were heard through their lawyer Mr.\n\nKashyap H. Shukla.           In view of the above specific\n\ninformation the contention contrary to the same is liable\n\nto be rejected.\n\n9)   The second objection is that locality publication was\n\nnot effected under Section 6(2) of the Act.       In the same\n\ncounter   affidavit,   the   Land   Acquisition   Officer   has\n\nasserted that publication of notification under Section 6\n\nwas published in the Gazette dated 21.03.1990.          Public\n\nNotice displayed at the office of Mamlatdar of the\n\nconcerned Ward on 19.04.1990. In the light of the said\n\ninformation, the claim that no publication of notice in the\n\nlocality under Section 6(2) cannot be accepted.\n\n10) The third and the important objection relates to\n\npassing of Award under Section 11A. It is the stand of the\n\nappellants that Award was not made within two years\n\nfrom the date of last publication of Notification under\n\nSection 6 hence the acquisition is vitiated.      Since heavy\n\nreliance was placed on the said objection, it is useful to\n\n \nrefer Section 6 and Section 11A of the Act which reads\n\nthus:\n\n    \"6. Declaration that land is required for a public\n    purpose.- (1) Subject to the provision of Part VII of this Act,\n    when the appropriate Government is satisfied, after\n    considering the report, if any, made under section 5A, sub-\n    section (2), that any particular land is needed for a public\n    purpose, or for a Company, a declaration shall be made to\n    that effect under the signature of a Secretary to such\n    Government or of some officer duly authorized to certify its\n    orders and different declarations may be made from time to\n    time in respect of different parcels of any land covered by the\n    same notification under section 4, sub-section (1)\n    irrespective of whether one report or different reports has or\n    have been made (wherever required) under section 5A, sub-\n    section (2);\n\n    Provided that no declaration in respect of any particular\n    land covered by a notification under section 4, sub-section\n    (1)-\n\n    (i) published after the commencement of the Land\n    Acquisition (Amendment and Validation) Ordinance, 1967 (1\n    of 1967), but before the commencement of the Land\n    Acquisition (Amendment) Act, 1984 shall be made after the\n    expiry of three years from the date of the publication of the\n    notification; or\n\n    (ii) published after the commencement of the Land\n    Acquisition (Amendment) Act, 1984 shall be made after the\n    expiry of one year from the date of the publication of the\n    notification:\n\n    Provided further that no such declaration shall be made\n    unless the compensation to be awarded for such property is\n    to be paid by a Company, or wholly or partly out of public\n    revenues or some fund controlled or managed by a local\n    authority.\n\n    Explanation 1. - In computing any of the periods referred to\n    in the first proviso, the period during which any action or\n    proceeding to be taken in pursuance of the notification\n    issued under section 4, sub-section (1), is stayed by an order\n\n\n \nof a Court shall be excluded.\n\nExplanation 2. - Where the compensation to be awarded for\nsuch property is to be paid out of the funds of a corporation\nowned or controlled by the State, such compensation shall\nbe deemed to be compensation paid out of public revenues.\n\n(2) Every declaration shall be published in the Official\nGazette, and in two daily newspapers circulating in the\nlocality in which the land is situated of which at least one\nshall be in the regional language, and the Collector shall\ncause public notice of the substance of such declaration to\nbe given at convenient places in the said locality (the last of\nthe dates of such publication and the giving of such public\nnotice, being hereinafter referred to as the date of the\npublication of the declaration), and such declaration shall\nstate the district or other territorial division in which the\nland is situate, the purpose for which it is needed, its\napproximate area, and, where a plan shall have been made\nof the land, the place where such plan may be inspected.\n\n(3) The said declaration shall be conclusive evidence that the\nland is needed for a public purpose or for a company, as the\ncase may be; and, after making such declaration, the\nappropriate Government may acquire the land in manner\nhereinafter appearing.\n\n11A. Period within which an award shall be made.- (1) The\nCollector shall make an award under section 11 within a\nperiod of two years from the date of the publication of the\ndeclaration and if no award is made within that period, the\nentire proceeding for the acquisition of the land shall lapse:\n\nProvided that in a case where the said declaration has been\npublished before the commencement of the Land Acquisition\n(Amendment) Act, 1984, the award shall be made within a\nperiod of two years from such commencement.\n\nExplanation - In computing the period of two years referred\nto in this section, the period during which any action or\nproceeding to be taken in pursuance of the said declaration\nis stayed by an order of a Court shall be excluded.\"\n\n\n\n\n \n11) These provisions were considered by this Court in\n\nvarious decisions.       In Krishi Utpadan Mandi Samiti\n\nand Another vs. Makrand Singh and Others, (1995) 2\n\nSCC 497, the question that was posed for consideration\n\nwas whether the High Court was right in its conclusion\n\nthat the declaration under Section 6 was published after\n\nthree years and the last of the publications shall be the\n\nlast date for the purpose of computing three years&apos; period\n\nenvisaged in clause (i) of the proviso to sub-section (1) of\n\nSection 6 of the Act as amended by Land Acquisition\n\n(Amendment) Act, 1984. The discussion and conclusion\n\nin paras 4 and 5 are relevant:\n\n     \"4. The question, therefore, is that which date of the\n     publications in three steps i.e. publication in the Gazette,\n     two newspapers and local publication to be the last date for\n     the purpose of computing three years&apos; limitation prescribed\n     in clause (i) of the proviso to Section 6(1) of the Act. Prima\n     facie, it gives an impression that the last of any of the three\n     steps puts in motion, the running of limitation of three\n     years. But on deeper probe, it does not appear to be so and\n     such a construction would easily defeat the public purpose\n     and deflects the course of justice. So it is necessary to\n     understand the scheme and policy of the Act to get the crux\n     of the question. It is seen that sub-section (1) of Section 4\n     gives power of eminent domain to the State to acquire the\n     land, whenever it appears to it that the land is needed or\n     likely to be needed for any public purpose or for any\n     company, by a notification published in the Official Gazette\n\n\n \nand two daily newspapers circulating in that area and at\nleast one of them should be in the regional language and\nalso the Collector is enjoined to cause public notice of the\nsubstance of notification to be given at convenient places in\nthe said locality in which the land is situated. It is also\nmentioned thereunder that the last date of such publication\nand the giving of such public notice \"being hereinafter\nreferred to\" as the date of publication of the notification. It\nwould be seen that the purpose of notification under Section\n4(1) is an intimation to the owner or person having an\ninterest in the land that Government exercised the power of\neminent domain in relation to his land and for public\npurpose his land is needed or likely to be needed; puts an\nembargo on his freedom to deal with the land as an\nunencumbered land and also pegs the price of the land\nprevailing as on that date. It also is a caveat to the Collector\nto make the award under Section 11 as well as to determine\nthe market value prevailing as on the last of the dates to be\nthe date and the award should be made within a period\nprescribed by Section 11-A, lest the entire acquisition shall\nstand lapsed. The word `hereinafter&apos; is for such purposes as\nwell as for the purpose of determination of the compensation\nunder Chapter III of the Act as well. Therefore, the word\n`hereinafter&apos; referred to as the last date of the publication of\nthe notification is the date from which the prevailing prices\nof the land is to be computed etc.\n\n\n5. Clause (i) of the proviso to Section 6(1) mandates the\npublication of the declaration in the Official Gazette and it\nshould be within three years from the date of the publication\nof the notification under Section 4(1) i.e. the last of the dates\nreferred to in Section 4(1). The word `publish&apos; emphasises the\nact accomplished i.e. declaration under Section 6(1) being\npublished in the Official Gazette. The last date under Section\n6(2) shall be the date for the purposes \"hereinafter referred\nto\" would be not for computing the period of three years\nprescribed in clause (i) of proviso to Section 6(1) of the Act as\nit was already done, but purposes to be followed hereinafter.\nOtherwise language would have been \"hereinbefore done\".\nSub-section (2) as such did not prescribe any limitation\nwithin which the declaration under Section 6(1) or other\nsteps hereinafter to be taken, in other words, the steps to be\ntaken thereafter in making the award under Section 11 or in\ncomputation of the period prescribed in Section 11-A. The\npublication of the declaration in two daily newspapers\nhaving circulation in the locality one of which is in the\nregional language and the publication of the substance of\n\n\n \n    the declaration in the locality are ministerial acts and is a\n    procedural part. It appears that these publications are\n    required to be done to make the declaration published in the\n    manner, to be conclusive evidence of the public purpose\n    under Section 6(1) and also to provide limitation to make the\n    award under Section 11 by the Collector. In other words, the\n    limitation prescribed under Section 11-A is for the purpose\n    of making the award and if the Collector fails to do so, the\n    entire proceeds under Sections 4(1) and 6(1) shall stand\n    lapsed. If this consistent policy of the Act is understood\n    giving teeth to the operational efficacy to the scheme of the\n    Act and public purpose the Act seeks to serve, we are of the\n    considered view that publication in the Official Gazette\n    already made under clause (i) of proviso to sub-section (1) of\n    Section 6 is complete, as soon as the declaration under\n    Section 6(1) was published in the Official Gazette. That will\n    be the date for the purpose of computation of three years&apos;\n    period from the last of the dates of the publication of the\n    notification under Section 4(1). The procedural ministerial\n    acts prescribed under sub-section (2) are only for the\n    purpose of the procedure to be followed `hereinafter&apos;, in other\n    words, the steps to be taken subsequent to the publication of\n    the declaration under Section 6(1) of t Property - Validity of securing procedures - Sections 4, 5A, 6, 6 and 11A Land Acquisition Act, 1894 - Acquisition procedures were started under the Land Acquisition Act for development of a school on the land under the Surat Municipal Corporation - Appellants the proprietors, tested the obtaining on grounds procurement not done according to arrangements set down under the Act and honor was not made inside two years from the date of last production of Notification under Section 6 subsequently, the obtaining is vitiated - High Court rejected the request of favored by the Appellants - Hence exhibit Appeal — Whether High court was supported in expelling the appeal to favored by the Appellants - Held, notice under Section 4 in the Official Gazette was distributed, open notice was shown at the workplace of Mamlatdar of the concerned Ward and knowing about protests under Section 5A was additionally settled and the Appellants were given a few open doors for hearing their complaints now and again — Notification under Section 6 was keep going distributed on nineteenth April, 1990 and in this manner the time of two years stipulated in Section 11A would start to keep running from nineteenth April, 1990 and, along these lines, the distribution of the Award under Section 11 of the Act on eighteenth April, 1992 was inside the stipulated time point of confinement of two years - Land being referred to kept under booking for school in the endorsed improvement anticipate the State Government under Section 17 of the Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Act, it is the obligation of the Corporation to gain the land for actualizing the arrangements of the same - No Interference with the Order of High court - Appeal expelled \r\n\r\nProperty - \"Need\" and \"need\" - Appellant fought that in perspective of presence of many schools in and around the region, there is no compelling reason to build up a school in the place that is known for the Appellants - Held, In regard of \"need\" and \"need\", it is for the Government and their specialists to take a choice considering different angles - If such a choice is taken in view of materials it is not for the Court to question their case - Appeal expelled ','Arjun Singh Vs State Of H.P Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.\n\n\n\n\n1.    Leave granted.\n\n\n\n2.    Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a learned Single Judge\n\nof the Himachal Pradesh High Court upholding the conviction of the\n\nappellant for offences punishable under Sections 376, 511, 363 and 366 as\n\nwell as Section 109 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short the `IPC&apos;). He\nwas sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 7 years, 3 years, 4\n\nyears, 5 years and 7 years for the aforesaid offences alongwith fine with\n\ndefault stipulation.\n\n\n\n3.    Prosecution version as unfolded during trial is as follows:\n\n\n\n      On 18.7.1999, the victim (PW10) boarded the bus to Shimla from\n\nSolan. When the bus bearing registration No. HP-12-4113 reached near\n\npetrol pump (HIMFED) situated near Nav Bahar towards Chotta Shimla, all\n\nthe passengers got down, except the prosecutrix and accused-appellant\n\nArjun Singh. Accused Arjun Singh committed forcible sexual intercourse\n\nwith the prosecutrix against her will and without her consent. The victim\n\nwas kidnapped by the accused who was minor at the time of kidnapping in\n\nbus No.HP-12-4113 from Solan. The accused had induced the prosecutrix\n\nthat he would marry her after reaching Nalagarh. The FIR was registered.\n\nThereafter the investigation was carried out and the challan was put in the\n\nCourt. The appellant was charged for offences punishable under Sections\n\n376, 511, 366 and 109 of the Indian Penal Code. The prosecution examined\n\n15 witnesses to prove its case. The appellant had examined Shri Arvind\n\nSharma (DW 1) as defence witness. The learned Additional Sessions Judge,\n\n\n\n \nSolan, convicted and sentenced the accused as stated above. The sentences\n\nwere directed to run concurrently. It is to be noted that two persons faced\n\ntrial for the aforesaid offences i.e. appellant who was the conductor of the\n\nvehicle, and one Daler Singh who was the driver of the vehicle. Since\n\naccused persons abjured guilt, trial was held. The trial court placed reliance\n\non the evidence of the prosecutrix (PW1) and her mother (PW 3). As a plea\n\nrelating to the age of the prosecutrix to show that she was a consenting party\n\nwas taken, the person who had issued the date of birth certificate was\n\nexamined as PW 4. According to the said certificate the date of birth was\n\n19th October, 1984. She was admitted to the school on 1st April, 1997 and\n\nhad left it on 24th October, 1998. The trial Court held that the age of the\n\nvictim was less than 16 years and placed reliance on the documents\n\nproduced. It was also submitted by the accused persons that no rape has\n\nbeen committed. This plea also was rejected by the trial court.\n\n\n\n      Accordingly the trial court while holding the appellant guilty,\n\nacquitted co-accused. As noted above, appeal before the High Court was\n\ndismissed.\n\n\n\n\n \n4.    In support of the appeal the stand taken before the trial court and the\n\nHigh Court were reiterated.\n\n\n\n5.    Learned counsel for the respondent-State supported the judgment of\n\nthe High Court.\n\n\n\n6.    So far as the age aspect is concerned in Vishnu v. State of\n\nMaharashtra [2006(1) SCC 283] it was inter alia held as follows:\n\n\n                \"20. It is urged before us by Mr Lalit that the\n             determination of the age of the prosecutrix by\n             conducting ossification test is scientifically proved and,\n             therefore, the opinion of the doctor that the girl was of\n             18-19 years of age should be accepted. We are unable to\n             accept this contention for the reasons that the expert\n             medical evidence is not binding on the ocular evidence.\n             The opinion of the Medical Officer is to assist the court\n             as he is not a witness of fact and the evidence given by\n             the Medical Officer is really of an advisory character and\n             not binding on the witness of fact.\"\n\n\n\n\n7.    In State of Chhattisgarh v. Lekhram [2006(5) SCC 736] it was held\n\nthat the register maintained in a school is admissible evidence to prove the\n\ndate of birth of the person concerned in terms of Section 35 of the Indian\n\nEvidence Act, 1872 (in short `Evidence Act&apos;). It may be true that in the\n\nentry of the school register is not conclusive but it has evidentiary value.\n\n \n8.    Learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that the evidence of\n\nthe Doctor clearly rules out the commission of rape. The Medical officer\n\n(PW 9) has stated that rape had not been committed and sexual intercourse\n\nhad not taken place.\n\n\n\n9.    The offence of rape occurs in Chapter XVI of IPC. It is an offence\n\naffecting the human body. In that Chapter, there is a separate heading for\n\n`Sexual offence&apos;, which encompasses Sections 375, 376, 376-A, 376-B,\n\n376-C, and 376-D. `Rape&apos; is defined in Section 375. Sections 375 and 376\n\nhave been substantially changed by Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1983,\n\nand several new sections were introduced by the new Act, i.e. 376-A, 376-\n\nB, 376-C and 376-D. The fact that sweeping changes were introduced\n\nreflects the legislative intent to curb with iron hand, the offence of rape\n\nwhich affects the dignity of a woman. The offence of rape in its simplest\n\nterm is `the ravishment of a woman, without her consent, by force, fear or\n\nfraud&apos;, or as `the carnal knowledge of a woman by force against her will&apos;.\n\n`Rape&apos; or `Raptus&apos; is when a man hath carnal knowledge of a w (1) Indian Penal Code, 1860 - Sections 376, 511, 365, 366 and 109- - Rape, and so forth.- - Conviction and sentence - Whether subject to obstruction?- - Held, \"halfway\"- - Rape does not seem to have been conferred - But rather endeavor to submit assault - Clearly settled - Hence, offense under Section 376 not made out- - But rather that under Section 511 obviously made out- - In foundation of certainties of case, Section 109 has no application - Appellant properly indicted and sentenced for offenses under Sections 365, 366 and 511- - But his conviction under Sections 109 and 376 unsustainable- - But put aside. \r\n\r\n(2) Evidence Act, 1872- - Sections 3 and 9- - Appreciation of proof - Evidence of therapeutic officer on age- - Really of counseling character- - And not official on observer of actuality. ','Karnataka Industrial Areas Vs Nandi Cold Storage Pvt. Ltd J U D G M E N T I.A. NO.1 IN CIVIL APPEAL NO. 5542 OF 2004 Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.\r\n\r\n1. Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission at New Delhi (in short the &#39;National Commission&#39;). Respondent had filed a complaint against the appellant before the National Commission.\r\n\r\n2. Background facts in a nutshell are as follows:\r\n\r\n3. In the complaint respondent inter alia stated as follows:\r\n\r\nThe complainant company, desirous of opening a cold storage unit in the State of Karnataka, applied for allotment of land to the appellant in August 1991. After meeting all the formalities required from time to time by the appellant, a plot bearing No.2 of Chickballapur Industrial Area, measuring 2.5 acre of land, was allotted for setting up a cold storage. Possession certificate was issued on 26/30.8.93. The complainant also in the meantime obtained a loan of Rs.67 lakh from the Karnataka State Financial Corporation (in short &#39;KFC&#39;). For the first time in August 1994, a letter was written by appellant to the complainant that &quot;the company could not go ahead with construction activity on the plot allotted as the erstwhile land owner of plot No.2 covered in Sy.No.29 and 30 of Jadalathimmanahally Village has obtained stay order from the High Court of Karnataka in W.P.No.70/88 challenging the acquisition proceedings. The Board initiated action for vacating the stay order granted by the High Court of Karnataka. However, the company could not go ahead with implementation in view of the stay order granted by the High Court. The complainant sought for permission to go ahead with implementation after the litigation in respect of the above land is disposed of by the High Court. The Board should also grant extension of time to the company for implementation of the project after disposal of the litigation.\r\n\r\n4. Original land holder took back possession forcibly in view of the order of the Karnataka High Court. The writ petition filed by the original land holder was allowed by the High Court leaving the complainant high and dry without land, more so when in September 1994, the KFC cancelled the term loan in view of the fact that no progress was made in the implementation of the project. Since the complainant was keen to go ahead with the project, on collecting some information, it approached the appellant to allot plot No.1-A and 1-B which was lying vacant, which were allotted to the complainant in 1995. But it seems that bad luck had not stopped chasing the complainant. As soon as the allotment in respect of plot no.1- A and 1-B were made on a resumed plot, the original allottees moved the High Court making the complainant a party before it. However, after protracted litigation, the writ petition was dismissed but in the meanwhile the loans had been cancelled and the complain Consumer Protection Act, 1986 - Sections 2 (1) (g) and 21- - Deficiency in administration - Allotment of plot for setting up mechanical units- - About insufficiency in administration, adjust approach received by National Commission - However, remuneration conceded is on higher side- - Hence, decreased to Rs. one lakh from Rs. three lakhs.\r\n NA'), 'idx_court_decisions_0', '', 5 AS around, 300 AS limit)";i:1;i:80;i:2;s:21:"yii\db\Command::query";i:3;d:1579264312.883417;i:4;a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"file";s:68:"C:\xampp\htdocs\legal_mix\common\models\JudgmentMastSphinxSearch.php";s:4:"line";i:231;s:8:"function";s:8:"queryAll";s:5:"class";s:14:"yii\db\Command";s:4:"type";s:2:"->";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"file";s:65:"C:\xampp\htdocs\legal_mix\frontend\controllers\SiteController.php";s:4:"line";i:862;s:8:"function";s:16:"searchJudgements";s:5:"class";s:38:"common\models\JudgmentMastSphinxSearch";s:4:"type";s:2:"->";}}i:5;i:9579560;}i:54;a:6:{i:0;s:256071:"CALL SNIPPETS(('Babu Kuttan R.Pillai & Anr Vs State Of Maharashtraa11 LI.TTTTTTJ J U D G M E N T D.P. MOHAPATRA,J This appeal, filed by accused no.1 Babu Kuttan Ramkrishna Pillai and accused no.2 Umesh @ Babu Purshottam Bhatt of TADA ACT Spl.Case No.33 of 1994, is directed against the judgment and order dated 21.8.1998 of the Designated Court at Brihan `Mumbai under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 (for short TADA Act). In the said case seven accused persons faced trial under Section 120-B read with 307 r/w 34, 307 r/w 114, 307 r/w 149, 387 r/w 34, 143, 144, 147, 148 and 506 (ii), 353 r/w 114 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 3(2)(ii), 3(3), 3(5), 5 and 6 of the TADA Act and section r/w 25(IB)\r\n\r\n(a), Section 5 r/w 27 of the Arms Act. The gist of the prosecution case relevant for the purpose of this proceeding may be stated thus: With the growth of industry, commerce and trade in and around the city of Mumbai which generates substantial quantity of wealth, there has been increase of organised activities by gangs of anti-socials to extract money from affluent sections of society like developers, hoteliers and other businessmen by putting them in fear of death and then to demand substantial sums of money commonly known as &quot;Khadani&quot; i.e. protection money. One such gang was operating in the city under Amar Naik @ Bhai, who died a couple of years before the decision in the case at an encounter with the police. The prosecution alleged that in pursuance of a criminal conspiracy between 15.1.1994 to 16.5.1994 the accused persons and others of the gang embarked upon preparatory acts like procuring the information about the names of the builders of M/s Kalpataru Construction Company which was engaged in developing a property at Pali Hill, named Nakshatra Building. PW-7 Sudhir Tambe was the Senior Vice-President of the company with its head office at Nariman Point. He used to sit in the head- office. PW 6 Pachapur, Civil Engineer, was an employee of the company who used to remain at the site to supervise the construction. As the prosecution story runs, on 15.4.1994 between 11.30 a.m. and 12.00 noon while PW 6 was on duty at the construction site, accused no.3, Nitin Vasant Venugurlekar armed with revolver and accused No.4 Rajindera @ Rajan Mahadeo Margaj armed with a chopper and accused no.5 Jayendra @ Jai Anandrao Jadhav also armed with a chopper visited the site of Nakshatra Building; they threatened the workers at the site, forcibly brought PW 6 Pachapur in a room on the ground floor and man-handled him. Accused no.3, pointing a revolver at him demanded the name, address and telephone number of the builders. PW 6 disclosed the name of PW 7 Tambe and gave his telephone number to them. The accused then asked him to go to the office of the builders at Nariman Point and make the arrangement for a telephonic talk with Tambe. PW 6 rushed to the office and told Tambe of what had happened at the construction site. This was followed by telephonic calls from the accused who wanted to speak to Tambe. Attempts were made by PW 6 and PW 7 to avoid any discussion with the gangsters. Two or three days thereafter when the accused got Tambe on the telephone he (Tambe) gave them some other telephone numbers and asked them to contact those persons including one D.N.Ghosh, the Security Contractor. Eight/ten days thereafter again a telephone call was made to the office of Tambe which was received by PW 6 who was informed by the person making the call that they could not get D. N. Ghosh on the telephone numbers furnished by Tambe. Thereafter PW 6 handed over the receiver to Tambe. This incident was followed by several threats given by the gangsters to workers and also repeated telephone calls made to the Head Office of the company to contact Tambe. The staff of the site office absented from work resulting in virtual closure of construction activity. On 11.5.1994 the deceased Sanjay Patil telephoned to Tambe and warned him that he is wasting time and should meet him without further delay. After some days there was one more similar call from Sanjay Patil and he asked Tambe that he should talk to Bhai and saying so he handed over the receiver to another person who gave his identity as Amar Naik (since deceased), who told Tambe that he should pay Rs.10 lacs. The later pleaded his inability to pay such a heavy sum and after some discussion agreed to pay Rs.5 lacs. He was asked to come to Nakshatra Building site on 16.5.1994 along with money. In the meantime Tambe informed all the happenings to the Addl. Commissioner of Police Mr.Sanjeev Dayal and the then Dy. Commissioner of Police of Zone VII Mr. Rajanish Sheth within whose jurisdiction Khar Police Station fell.\r\n\r\nOn 16.5.1994 at about 12.00 noon the deceased Sanjay Patil telephoned Tambe and inquired from him as to what he was going to do about the payment and then Tambe replied that he will be leaving office at about 2.00 p.m. for Pali Hill. Sanjay Patil cautioned him that he should not make any haste and he should wait for his call so that he will take necessary instructions from his boss i.e. Amar Naik. At about 2.00 p.m. on that day there was a telephone call from Sanjay Patil telling that Tambe should not meet him at the Nakshatra Building site but instead he should meet him near the Ceaser Palace Hotel. This telephonic conversation was tape-recorded. Tambe was instructed on telephone that his man shall carry a white plastic bag containing the amount of Rs.5 lacs and shall wait near the entrance gate of Ceaser\r\n Indian Penal Code Section 120-B r/w 307, 34 likewise 307, r/w 114, 149 and 387 r/w 34, 143, 144, 147, 148 and 506(ii), 353 r/w 114 - Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 `TADA Act&#39; 25(IB)(a) - the Arms Act Section 5, 27 - Indian Penal Code, Section 120-B and 395 considered as saw - charged sentenced detainment for a long time - We do not find that the appreciation of evidence made by the learned trial Judge suffers from any illegality nor can findings recorded by him be said to be perverse- Appeal rejected.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n Appeal Dismissed','Jullundur Improvement Trust Vs Mohan Singh (Dead) By L.Rs. And Ors ORDER\r\n\r\n1. The respondents are the legal representatives of the deceased respondent..\r\n\r\n2. The Jullundur Improvement Trust was established and constituted under the Punjab Town Improvement Trust, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Improvement Trust&quot;). One of the duties and functions assigned to the trust is to frame development schemes for benefit of public. The improvement trust framed scheme known as &quot;development scheme&quot; for providing land to public within the municipal limits of Jullundur city. On 4.1.1970, the Trust resolved that the employees and trustees of the Jullundur Improvement Trust shall be granted residential accommodation on &quot;no profit no loss&quot; basis under the aforesaid scheme. It is not disputed that the plaintiff-respondent herein was one of the trustees of the improvement trust. On 22.1.1971, the plaintiff-respondent submitted an application for allotment of residential plot. While the said application was pending, the government 6y order dated 27.1.1971, directed that no trustee shall be allotted any plot of land in the development scheme formulated by the Improvement Trust at a reserved price. Despite that order of the state government, the trust by resolution dated 24.2.1971, resolved to allot a residential plot to the plaintiff-respondent subject to the approval of the state government. On 31.8.1971, a provisional letter of allotment of land was issued to the plaintiff-respondent. In pursuance thereof, it is alleged that the respondent deposited the price of the land. When the aforesaid fact came to the notice of the government, the government by letter dated 5.9.1972 called upon the improvement trust to show cause under what circumstances, the provisional allotment has been made in favour of the plaintiff-respondent. It is not disputed that the said scheme was subsequently not approved by the state government and it fell through. Under these circumstances, the plaintiff-respondent filed a suit for permanent injunction restraining the appellant herein from committing the breach of the alleged agreement and from cancelling the provisional allotment made i\r\n Trust and Societies - Contract - Specific help - Injunction - Improvement trust confined advancement conspire for giving area to open inside the civil furthest reaches of city - Employees and trustees to get convenience on no benefit no misfortune&quot; premise under the plan - Despite request of the state government that no trustee should be allocated any plot of land at a saved value, a determination gone by trust in which the offended party respondent partook and got a distribution of land - Scheme is no longer a subsisting plan as not endorsed by state Govt. - No closing contract has appeared between the litigant trust and the respondent - Relief of changeless directive looked for in the suit couldn&#39;t have been allowed by the trial court and insisted by the High Court - Sections 38, 39 and 41 of Specific Relief Act, 1963.\r\n Appeal Dismissed With Cost','Dasrath vs State Of M.P on 29 July, 2010 V.S. SIRPURKAR, J.\r\n\r\n1. The present appeal is directed against the judgment of the High Court dismissing the appeal of the appellant Dasrath. He was convicted by the Trial Court of the offence under Section 304B,&nbsp;Indian Penal Code&nbsp;(IPC) and was sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and pay a fine of Rs. 5,000/- and in default directed to suffer further imprisonment for one year. He was also convicted for the offence under&nbsp;Section 201,&nbsp;IPC&nbsp;and was directed to suffer rigorous imprisonment for one&nbsp;year with a fine of Rs.1,000/- and in default to suffer three month&#39;s further imprisonment.\r\n\r\n2. Initially, as many as three accused persons came to be tried by the Sessions Judge, they being accused No.1, Kalyan, accused No.2, Dasrath and accused No.3, Smt. Usha. While accused No.2, Dasrath is the present appellant, accused No.1, Kalyan Singh and accused No.3, Smt. Usha are his father and sister, respectively. The Trial Court had also convicted Kalyan Singh for the same offence. However, it acquitted accused No.3, Smt. Usha from all the charges. Both the accused had filed an appeal challenging their conviction and the sentences before the High Court. However, during the pendency of the appeal, accused No.1 Kalyan Singh expired and his appeal, thus, abated. The appeal of Dasrath, the present appellant came to be dismissed by the High Court and that is how he is before us.\r\n\r\n3. Shortly stated, the prosecution story was that Dasrath was married to Pinki who died under suspicious circumstance of burning. An intimation regarding death came to be given to the Police Station Pandhokhar, Distt. Gwalior. The said intimation was given by the complainant Vadehi Saran s/o Ramanand Kaurav who was none else but the father of the deceased Pinki. It was, inter alia, stated that on that day i.e. 12.8.1992 in the morning his son Jitendra Singh had gone to village Saujna for Rakhi&nbsp;festival to his daughter Pinki&#39;s house. But he returned at about 7 p.m. and told him that Pinki had caught fire and was sent to Daboh for treatment. Vadehi Saran further stated that on hearing the news, he along with some co-villagers went to Daboh. However, one Santosh belonging to his village met him near Dugdha Dairy and told him that Pinki had died. Then Vadehi Saran along with others went to village Saujna. But by the time they reached there, Pinki&#39;s cremation was over. It was because of this that they came to the Police Station and further action was requested on the basis of the death report.\r\n\r\n4. On this basis, a First Information Report was got registered on 16.8.92 wherein it was recorded that the death intimation was given on 12.8.92 at 23.15 hours orally about the death of Pinki. It was recorded on a preliminary inquiry made by Head Constable Jaswir Singh by visiting village Saujna and the Station House Officer R.S. Purohit had also made inquiries relating to the death. The place of occurrence was examined by SDOP R.K. Hirodia and inquiry was made from the deceased&#39;s father Vadehi Saran, uncle Uttam Singh, brothers Janved Singh and Jitendra Singh, mother Vidya Devi and sister Pratibha. During this inquiry, it was found that the deceased was married 2 years prior to the date of incident and because of the non-payment of dowry, her husband Dasrath, father-in- law Kalyan Singh and Sister-in-law Usha were harassing her. The earlier&nbsp;statement given by Vadehi Saran was repeated. It was then mentioned that on 12.8.1992 the sister-in-law Usha, husband Dasrath caught hold of Pinki and father-in-law Kalyan Singh poured kerosene oil on her and set her on fire because of which she got burnt. The accused thereafter cremated her and cleaned the place where occurrence had taken place.\r\n\r\n5. On the basis of this, further investigation ensued and after its completion, a charge-sheet came to be filed in the Court for offences under&nbsp;Sections 302,&nbsp;304&nbsp;B and 201&nbsp;IPC. The accused were charged accordingly. The prosecution, during the trial, examined as many as 11 witnesses. The accused persons abjured the guilt and as stated earlier only two of them came to be convicted, namely, Kalyan Singh and Dasrath. However, due to the death of Kalyan Singh during the pendency of the appeal, the appeal filed by Dasrath alone is to be considered.\r\n\r\n6. Learned Senior Counsel, Dr. J.N. Singh appearing on behalf of the accused attacked the judgment of both the Courts below, firstly, contending that conviction under&nbsp;Section 304B,&nbsp;IPC&nbsp;and Section, 201,&nbsp;IPC&nbsp;was wholly incorrect as it was not proved that Pinki had died a suspicious or un-natural death within the seven years of her marriage nor was her body found. He also contended that there was no question of demanding any dowry as no complaint was ever made for dowry nor was there any evidence regarding the demands of dowry. Lastly, he suggested that there&nbsp;was no question of any offence having been committed. He pointed out that the Trial Court had acquitted all the accused of the offence under&nbsp;Section 302,&nbsp;IPC&nbsp;though a charge was also framed under that Section and there was no appeal by the State Government against the acquittal under&nbsp;Section 302,&nbsp;IPC. Under such circumstances, it was clear that the accused persons could not be held responsible for the death of Pinki.\r\n\r\n7. As against this, Ms. Aishwarya Bhati, Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent pointed out that it could not be said that the death did not take place within seven years of marriage as the accused himself had admitted that the marriage had taken place six years prior to the trial. She further pointed out that there was a clear assertion made by the witnesses in their evidence. More particularly, Vadehi Saran (PW 4), Janved Singh (PW-5), Pratibha (PW-6) and Jitendra Singh (PW-8) had clearly asserted that the dowry was asked for by the accused persons. Learned Counsel further contended that if Pinki had died of burning, a report ought to have been made for un-natural death which the accused did not bother to make, instead they had cremated the body of Pinki without even intimating the relatives of the deceased and also without waiting for the police. This was the most suspicious circumstance which pointed towards the guilt of the accused.\r\n\r\n8. It is on the basis of these rival versions that it is to be seen as to whether the appellant Dasrath was rightly convicted for the offence.\r\n\r\n9. The first contention raised by the Learned Counsel for the defence regarding the corpus delicti not being found was countered by Ms. Bhati by saying that there can be no dispute about the death of Pinki. It is not the defence of the accused that Pinki was still living. On the other hand, the accused persons admittedly had cremated her body on the fateful day. Therefore, this is not a case, according to her, of corpus delicti not being found and, therefore, there being a serious suspicion about the death having taken place at all. The question is, in the absence of corpus delicti, could it be presumed that the accused persons alone were responsible for the death of Pinki. We must hasten to add here that the accused persons have already been acquitted of the murder charge. What remains to be seen is as to whether Pinki died an un-natural death within seven years of her marriage and whether her death was attributable to the demand of dowry and further whether she was dealt with cruelly soon before her death. If these ingredients are proved by the prosecution then the conviction of the accused under&nbsp;Section 304B,&nbsp;IPC&nbsp;will be complete.\r\n\r\n10. There can be no dispute that Pinki had died an un-natural death. In fact there is enough evidence to suggest that Pinki suffered the burn injuries. It is not the defence of the accused that she died a natural death.&nbsp;Both the Courts have very specifically held that Pinki suffered burn injuries and died because of the same. In fact Jitendra Singh (PW-8) was specific in his evidence that Pinki was burning on account of the kerosene having been poured on her body. In fact it is apparent from his cross-examination that when Pinki shouted, neighbours rushed to her house. There can be no dispute that this witness has been dis-believed and rightly so, insofar as his evidence about the accused deliberately burning Pinki is concerned. However, there can be no dispute that Pinki was burnt and it was clear that she had died an un-natural death. Again, it is clear from the report of the chemical analyzer that the kerosene residues were found from Packet-A which contained the clothes of Pinki which were seized during the investigation. Therefore, it is clear that Pinki&#39;s death was caused because of the burns and not in the normal circumstances. The finding of the Trial Court and the appellate Court in that behalf is correct. For this reason we are not impressed by the argument of the Learned Counsel that in the absence of corpus delicti, the conviction could not stand. Similarly, there can be no dispute that Pinki died within seven years of her marriage. Gandharv Singh (PW-1) had specifically asserted that the marriage was performed 3-4 years prior to the incident. Though this witness was declared hostile, at least the fact that marriage had taken place 3-4 years prior to the incident can be safely accepted. According to PW-2, Bhagwati Saran also the marriage had taken place within 5-6 years prior to trial.&nbsp;Again even this witness was declared hostile. However, that claim remained un-controverted. Third witness PW-3, Hari Saran asserted that the marriage was performed 6-7 years earlier to the date of his evidence. His evidence was in May, 1997 and even taking that the marriage took place somewhere in the year 1990, it would still be within seven years. Vadehi Saran, the father also said that the marriage had taken place 6-7 years prior to the date of his evidence which was again 30.09.1997. Therefore, according to his evidence even if the marriage could date back to the year 1987, it would still put the death of Pinki within seven years of her marriage.\r\n\r\n11. Therefore, it is certain that Pinki died an un-natural death by burning within seven years of her marriage. As regards dowry, Learned Counsel for the defence pointed out that there was no specific evidence nor was any allegation made in the First Information Report. We are not much impressed as we have seen from the evidence that there were demands of Buffalo made to Vadehi Saran, father of Pinki who did not accept that demand. Vadehi Saran has also specifically stated in his evidence that after 1 = years of the marriage when he went to the house of Pinki in the month of Shravan, door was closed and the appellants were beating Pinki and that the floor was smeared with blood and blood was also oozing out from the mouth of Pinki. He also asserted about the demand of a large&nbsp;size television as the television which was given in marriage was a small colour television. This evidence of torture is well supported by the evidence of Pratibha (PW-6), Anant Ram Singh (PW-7) and Uttam Singh (PW-9). In view of this, the Trial court and the appellate Court have recorded that, firstly, Pinki died an un-natural death because of burning within seven years of her marriage and, secondly concluded that she was subjected to cruelty and harassment by her husband and/or relatives in connection with the demand for dowry and that she was subjected to cruelty soon before her death.\r\n\r\n12. Similar is the case as regards the offence under&nbsp;Section 201,&nbsp;IPC. In fact it was incumbent upon the accused persons to firstly, inform the police about the un-natural death of Pinki. They did not do so. On the other hand, even after her death, they did not inform either the police or even the relatives like her father etc., though they could have done so. In stead they hurriedly conducted the funeral thereby causing destruction of evidence.\r\n\r\n13.&nbsp;In State of Rajasthan v. Jaggu Ram&nbsp;[2008 (12) SCC 51], this Court has considered the circumstance about the non-information to the parents and the hurried cremation. This was also a case where accused persons were tried for offence under&nbsp;Section 304B,&nbsp;IPC, where the accused, after the death of the unfortunate lady did not bother to inform her parents. In&nbsp;paragraph 26, this Court took a serious note of the manner in which the body was disposed of. The Court observed &quot;the disposal of the dead body in a hush-hush manner clearly establishes that the accused had done so with the sole object of concealing the real cause of death of Shanti @ Gokul.&quot;\r\n\r\n14. In that case, the funeral was conducted in the wee hours. In this case, funeral was conducted in the evening.\r\n\r\n15. From all this, it is clear that the prosecution has not only proved the offence under&nbsp;Section 304B,&nbsp;IPC&nbsp;with the aid of&nbsp;Section 113B,&nbsp;Indian Evidence Act&nbsp;but also the offence under&nbsp;Section 201,&nbsp;IPC. We are satisfied that all the three ingredients of&nbsp;Section 304B,&nbsp;IPC, they being:\r\n\r\na) that the death of a woman has been caused by burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under normal circumstances;\r\n\r\nb)&nbsp;that such death has been caused or has occurred within seven years of her marriage; and\r\n\r\nc)&nbsp;that soon before her death the woman was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband in connection with any demand for dowry.&quot;\r\n\r\nas also the presumption under&nbsp;Section 113B&nbsp;of India Evidence Act are fully established the case of prosecution.\r\n\r\n16. We have gone through the judgments of the Trial Court as well as the appellate Court carefully and we find that both the Courts have fully considered all the aspects of this matter. We, therefore, find nothing wrong with the judgments and confirm the same. The appeal is, therefore, dismissed.\r\n\r\n.......................................J.\r\n\r\n(V.S.

Officers J U D G M E N T ARUN KUMAR, J.\r\n\r\nThe forest service in the State of Orissa was constituted under the&nbsp;Indian Forest Act, 1927 and the Madras Forest Act, 1882. However, in 1972 the State had its own&nbsp;Forest Act. The primary object of the legislation was protection and management of forests in the State. The words &#39;forest officer&#39; have been defined under the Act to mean persons whom the State Government, or any officer empowered by it in this behalf, may appoint to carry out all or any of the purposes of the Act. A forest officer would include the Principal Chief Conservator of Forest as well as subordinates like Conservator of Forests, Forest Range Officers, Deputy Rangers and Foresters. In the year 1979 the State of Orissa adopted the Antyodaya Programme of the Central Government. Under the said programme Social Forestry Projects were undertaken which envisaged contact with the poorest of poor farmers to educate and train them in matters connected with farming. For purpose of the Social Forestry Projects, ex cadre posts of Forestry Extension Officers (for short &#39;FEOs&#39;) were created by the State Government. These were project related posts and their expenses were met from special funds raised for the project. The project was for specific purpose and for a specific period and was funded by the Central Government. The duration of the project was, however, extended from time to time in order to fulfil its objective.\r\n\r\nThe recruitment for the posts of FEOs was to be made from the open market. The officers were to be given training in raising of seedlings, nursery work etc. so that when they go to the field they could properly motivate and educate the farmers. The minimum qualification prescribed for FEOs was Intermediate with Botany as a subject. After recruitment these officers were to be posted in blocks wherein forestry extension work was undertaken. Certain blocks within the State were selected for such extension work as a part of the Forestry Extension Programme. The FEOs were envisaged as somebody remaining in touch with small farmers at the lowest level in each village block and assessing their requirements of forest species and other species. The respondents were recruited as Forestry Extension Officers under the Project from 1979 onwards. The respondents claim that they should be treated as part of the forest service under the Forest Department of the State Government and the posts held by them should have equal pay and equal status with the equal level posts in the Forest Department. They further claim that the posts held by them should be included in the channel of promotion to higher posts in the forest Department. The grievance of the respondents is that they have been stagnating in the posts of FEOs to which they were recruited nearly twenty years ago. According to them though the project has senior level posts of Social Forestry Supervisors but these posts are being filled by getting officers from forest service of the State Government on deputation, thereby the posts are being denied to them. In the matter of pay scales the grievance of the FEOs is that they are being equated with foresters who are neither as qualified as they are nor the foresters discharge such important functions as they are discharging. The minimum educational qualification prescribed for the post of forester in the quota meant for direct recruits at the relevant time was Matriculation only. The FEOs are trained to motivate people under Social Forestry Projects which requires contact with individual farmers and working at the grass root level. On the other hand, officers of the Forest Department of the State are mainly concerned with protecting forests, including forest property, preventing illegal felling of trees, keeping a check on forest contractors in order to ensure that forest produce is not illegally exploited and removed, prevention of poaching of forest animals etc..\r\n\r\nIn the year 1990, some of the Forest Extension Officers (FEOs) approached the Orrisa Administrative Tribunal for purposes of relief with regard to the above demands. In fact, before approaching the Tribunal they had made representation to the Government which did not yield any result. This Original Application was disposed of by the Orissa Administrative Tribunal vide order dated 7.9.1995. The Tribunal noted that the government was alive to the grievance being aired by the FEOs. It directed the State Government to decide the question of fixation of pay scales of FEOs within six months. The Association of the FEOs was allowed an opportunity to be heard by the officers of the State Government who would be taking such a decision on behalf of the government. The Tribunal further observed that when the question of pay scales would be considered, the question of promotional avenues should also be taken into consideration. It appears that nothing happened in pursuance of the said direction of the Tribunal. The Association of FEOs again approached the Tribunal by way of an application in the year 1996. The main grievance of the Association was that inspite of the FEOs being well qualified, they were being made to stagnate as there were no chances of promotion to higher posts available for them. The other grievance was about not getting appropriate scale of pay. The respondents claim that they should be treated as equivalent to Forest Rangers and the scale of pay and service benefits given to Forest Rangers should be available to them also.\r\n\r\nThe Tribunal noted that the nature of duties performed by FEOs and the Foresters could not be compared because the two were entirely different. Similarly, the method of recruitment and the basic qualifications required for eligibility to the two posts were different. However, the grievance of the FEOs could not be overlooked. Undoubtedly, the FEOs were not getting any chances of promotion nor they were getting the pay scales commensurate to the duties and functions being performed by them. Having regard to these aspects the Tribunal directed that those FEOs who have put in more than ten years of service as FEOs should be treated at par with the post of Deputy Ranger in the state forest service and placed in the same scale of pay which is now applicable to Deputy Rangers. They should also be made eligible for promotion to the posts of Forest Rangers. Those FEOs who have put in less than ten years of service may be treated at par with Foresters and be made eligible for promotion as Deputy Rangers. The Tribunal noted that it was stated in the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the Government in the proceedings before the Tribunal that steps were being taken for movement of the FEOs to other divisions so as to induct them into the mainstream. The Tribunal expected that this movement should start which would result in FEOs with more than ten years of service being posted as Deputy Rangers when they are moved from Social Forestry Section and others should be posted as Foresters. In view of the averments in the counter affidavit the Tribunal recommended to the State Government that the exercise in terms of the above directions should start without further delay so as to equip the FEOs for their induction into the mainstream whenever the Social Forestry Welfare Scheme is abolished. The order of the Tribunal also contained a direction that in future vacancies for Forest Rangers and Deputy Rangers quotas should be earmarked for FEOs with more than ten years of service and FEOs with less than ten years of service respectively. The Tribunal directed the State Government to complete the exercise within four weeks.\r\n\r\nThe State Government issued an order on 19th May, 1998 carrying out the directions contained in the aforesaid judgment of the Orissa Administrative Tribunal. Those Forest Extension Officers who had put in more than ten years of service were to be treated at par with Deputy Rangers and placed in the same pay scale i.e. 1200-30-1560-EB-40-2040. Since out of 105 Forestry Extension Officers, 100 had already completed more than ten years of service as FEOs they were to be declared Senior Grade Forestry Extension Officers and were to be made eligible for promotion to the post of Forest Ranger. Those FEOs who had rendered less than ten years of service were to be treated at par with Foresters. The order contained further details about how the various quotas were to be worked out and postings were to be made.\r\n\r\nOne of the Foresters, under an apprehension that FEOs belonging to the Social Forestry Projects were being merged with the mainstream forest service of the State, approached the State Administrative Tribunal in the year 1998 seeking a declaration that Forestry Extension Officer do not belong to the cadre of the state forest service and that they should not be promoted to the posts of Deputy Rangers. The case of the applicant before the Tribunal was that the Social Forestry Project was a project scheme and the FEOs appointed under that scheme held ex-cadre posts. They were appointed to execute the Project and, therefore, they had nothing to do with regular forest service under the State Government. Since they were holding ex-cadre posts they could not claim promotion to the posts under the cadre. The Tribunal in its order dated 27th January, 1999 found that the apprehension of the petitioner before it was totally misplaced. The Forestry Extension Officers were being given only the pay scales of the equivalent posts in the State Government. Giving equivalent pay scales did not mean that they were being merged with the forest service of the State Government. Similarly regarding their promotions to the posts of Senior Social Forestry Extension Officer, their identity was being kept separate. The equivalence was provided only qua the scales of pay. The Tribunal noted:\r\n\r\n&quot;6. There is nothing in the letter of 19th May, 1998 to show that at any point of time the posts of Social Forestry Extension Officers or Senior Grade Social Forestry Extension Officers on one side and the Deputy Rangers and Foresters on the other have been made interchangeable posts. In order to give incentive to the Extension Officers only a separate channel of promotion has been creatd for them. Neither an Extension Officer can claim a post of Deputy Ranger nor a Forester can claim the post of Senior Grade Forestry Extension Officer.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe Tribunal further observed:\r\n\r\n&quot;7. However, in sub-para (i) of paragraph 1 of the said letter there is an observation that the forestry Extension Officer with more than 10 years of service should be posted as Deputy Ranger when it is proposed to move them out of the Social Forestry Directorate and others having less than ten years of service may be posted as Foresters. We are of the vie that since the government do not intend to make the posts interchangeable, this observation cannot be accepted as reasonable. Until the Extension Officers and Senior Extension Officers are regularly absorbed in the cadre of Foresters and Deputy Rangers and Rangers, they cannot be allowed to hold the posts of Ranger/Deputy Ranger or Forester. We, therefore, advise the State Government to frame a scheme or rules for their absorption in the Forest Department in the event of the abolition of the Directorate of Social Forestry. Until then, the Extension Officers shall not be brought over to the cadre of Foresters and Deputy Rangers. In case the Government desire that the Senior Grade Forest Extension Officer should also have further promotional facility, it is open to the State Government to consider and create appropriate promotional posts for them.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe above order was passed on 27th January, 1999. The State Government filed a Special Leave Petition in this Court challenging the earlier order of the Tribunal dated 5th March, 1997 in the first week of November, 2000 without even making a reference to the subsequent order dated 27th January, 1999. Thus the order dated 27th January, 1999 has not been challenged by any party. Leave to appeal was granted in the Special Leave Petition and the matter was registered as Civil Appeal No.1079 of 2001 which is being disposed of by this order.\r\n\r\nDuring the pendency of this Civil Appeal the Government of Orrisa passed a resolution dated 8th August, 2003 re-organising the field establishments of the Forest and Environment Department under the &#39;Forestry and Wildlife&#39; wing by abolishing the Afforestation and Social Forestry Division and Circles and creating a number of Territorial and Wildlife Divisions and Circles. Further the resolution abolishes certain establishments including the Social Forestry Department. The staff of the Departments which were being abolished was deployed within the remaining establishments. The said resolution provides that the Government had decided to abolish eighteen establishments under the control of Director, Social Forestry Project with which we are concerned in the present case. With the abolition of eighteen establishments of Social Forestry Project, the staff of the establishments is to be deployed in the Divisions/Circles/State Forest Headquarters as per the plan given in the resolution. The resolution came into effect on the date it was issued i.e. 8th August, 2003 and provides that the reorganization exercise was to be completed by 30th September, 2003. The exercise had started and in pursuance thereof a Memo dated 24.10.2003 was issued. None of the parties appearing before us have disputed the said resolution. In fact, an affidavit was filed in the present proceedings on behalf of the respondent Association bringing the said resolution on record. The respondents further stated that in view of the resolution dated 8th August, 2003 the points sought to be raised by the Government in the present appeal were no longer available to it. By the said resolution the members of the respondent-association i.e. Forest Extension Officers (FEOs) who were working under the Social Forestry Projects had been taken into the mainstream i.e. into the Forest Department of the Government of Orissa called the Territorial and Wildlife Division. The Social Forestry Directorate stands abolished. It is a resolution of the State Government. Naturally the learned counsel for the appellant, i.e. the State of Orissa accepts the resolution. In view of these developments the FEOs have ceased to be officers working against a particular project. They have become part of the forest service of the State Government. Their grievances do not survive any more. We have also heard the learned counsel appearing for some of the forest service officers who had intervened in these proceedings. He has tried to canvas that the position of his clients should not be adversely affected due to the merger. As at present he could not spell out any cause for worry for his clients. In any case, in the event of any prejudice being caused to the interveners, they will have independent cause of action for which they are free to pursue their remedies. So far as the State Government is concerned, it is bound by its resolution and, in fact, has taken steps to implement the same. Nothing survives in this appeal. The same is accordingly dismissed as having become infructuous.

The donor is exempt under s. 5 (1) (xiv) from liability to pay tax only if the gift is in the course of carrying on a business, pro fession or vocation and is made bona fide for the purpose of such business, profession or vocation. The clause does not enact that a gift made by a person carrying on any business is exempt from tax, nor does it provide that a gift is exempt from tax merely because the property is used for the purpose for which it was used by the donor. Without deciding whether the test of commercial expediency&quot; is strictly appropriate to the claim 3 76 for exemption under S. 5 ( 1 ) (xiv), we are of the view that there is no evidence on the record to prove that the gift to Thomas was &quot;in the course of carrying on the business&quot; of the donor, and &quot;for the purpose of the business&quot;. The appeal is allowed and the order passed by the High Court is set aside. The Commissioner of Gift Tax will get his costs in this Court and the High Court.

The accused persons are the father and brother respectively of the deceased. The incident purportedly took place on 3.1.1990. Though the prosecution relied on the evidence of many persons who supposedly witnessed the occurrence, while deposing in Court, most of them resiled from the statements made during investigation. The version projected by the prosecution was that the deceased was throttled and also poison was administered to him. But the report of the Forensic Science Laboratory stated that the viscera did not contain any poison. The prosecution, therefore, gave up its stand that the deceased was administered poison by the accused persons. There were purportedly some extra-judicial confessions on which the Trial Court relied. Accordingly, the accused persons were convicted for offences punishable under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short &#39;IPC&#39;). In appeal the High Court has, by the impugned judgment, directed acquittal.\r\n\r\nLearned counsel for the appellant-State su\r\n Criminal - Extra legal admission - Section 302 perused with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 - Trial Court sentenced the respondents on the premise of additional legal admissions - In offer High Court cleared the respondents - Hence, introduce request - Held, High Court alluded to the additional legal admissions and found not solid - Witnesses gave shifting rendition about the way in the purported additional legal admissions - Persons who asserted to have seen the occurrence resiled from the announcements made amid examination - No proof to embroil the denounced people - Manipulation done to show report gotten by Magistrate on 3.1.1990 while date of seal found on Exh.

Subhashini for the Respondents.\n     The Judgment of the Court was delivered by\n     RANGANATHAN, J.  The seeds	 of the	 present controversy\nwere sown  as early  as in 1946. It is unfortunate that this\nmatter should  be  coming  up  before  this  Court  for	 its\nconsideration nearly  five decades  later, though it must be\npointed out  that the  issue in	 its  present  form  is	 the\noutcome of an amendment made by the Finance (No.2) Act, 1980\n(hereinafter referred  to as  &apos;the 1980	 Act&apos;) to the Income\nTax Act,  1961* (hereinafter referred to as &apos;the 1961 Act&apos;).\nIt is also a curious co-incidence that the 1980 Act effected\ntwo amendments in the 1961 Act with retrospective effect and\nthe validity  of both  these provisions have been challenged\nbefore the courts. The first was the controversy with regard\nto the	retrospective amendment	 of s.80-J which was settled\nby this	 Court by its decision in Lohia Machines Limited  v.\nUnion of India, (1985) 152 I.T.R. 308 (SC). It is the second\namendment to  the provisions  contained in  section 35(2) of\nthe 1961  Act that has given rise to the present controversy\nbetween the parties.\n     The question  is really  one of  interpretation of	 two\nimportant provisions relating to the computation of business\nincome for  purposes of	 income tax.  We may  start with the\nprovisions of  the Indian  lncome Tax Act, 1922 (hereinafter\nreferred to  as the &apos;1922 Act&apos;). The computation of business\nincome for  purposes of	 income tax  was done  in accordance\nwith the  provisions of	 section 10  of the said Act. In the\nprocess of making such computation, the Act provided for two\nimportant deductions  (among  others),	in  respect  of	 the\ncapital assets	employed in  the business. The first was the\ndeduction under clause (vi) of Section 10(2) of an allowance\nin respect of the depreciation of building, machinery, plant\nor furniture being the property of the assessee and used for\nthe purposes  of the business, at a prescribed percentage of\nthe written  down value	 of such  assets. This	allowance is\ncalculated, in	respect of  the year  of acquisition  of the\nproperty, at a percentage of its actual cost to the assessee\nand in subsequent years at a graduated scale on the basis of\nthe actual  cost less the depreciation allowances granted in\nthe preceding years. In strict principle, this is an\nallowance of  capital nature but it is now well settled that\nthe allowance  of depreciation	has to be taken into account\nin order  to ascertain	the true  profits of a business and,\ntherefore, an  assessee	 is  permitted	to  deduct,  in	 the\ncomputation of	the business  income year  after  year,	 the\nprescribed percentage  of the  value of	 the assets used for\nthe purposes of business. The second allowance was not there\nin the 1922 Act originally and was introduced by the Income-\ntax (Amendment)	 Act, 1946.  The introduction was of certain\nallowances  in	 respect  of   expenditure  on.	 \"scientific\nresearch related  to the  business\", an expression which was\ndefined in  a fairly  comprehensive manner  by the  statute.\nThree types  of allowances were permitted in respect of this\ncategory of  expenditure of which we are here concerned with\nonly one.  This provision  was contained  in clause (xiv) of\nS.10(2) which permitted a deduction.\n     \"in respect of any expenditure of a\n     capital   nature	 on   scientific\n     research related  to the  business,\n     an allowance  for each  of the Five\n     consecutive     previous	   year.\n     beginning	 with the  year in which\n     the expenditure  was  incurred,  or\n     where the	expenditure was incurred\n     prior to  the commencement	 of  the\n     business,	for  each  of  the  five\n     consecutive     previous	   years\n     beginning with  the year  in  which\n     the business  was commenced,  equal\n     2to one-fifth of such expenditure:\n     Provided that no allowance shall be\n     made for  any expenditure	incurred\n     more than	three years  before  the\n     commencement of the business:\n     A Provided further that-\n      XXX   XXX	    XXX\n     (d) where	a deduction  is	 allowed\n     for any  previous year  under  this\n     clause in	respect	 of  expenditure\n     represented wholly or partly by any\n     asset,  no	  deduction   shall   be\n     allowed under clause (vi) or clause\n     (vii) for the same previous year in\n     respect of that asset;\n     (e) where	an asset  is used in the\n     business after it ceases to be used\n     for scientific  research related to\n     that business,  and a  claim for an\n     allowance	under	clause	(vi)  or\n     clause (vii)  is made in respect of\n     that asset,  the actual cost to the\n     assessee  of  the	asset  shall  be\n     treated as reduced by the amount of\n     any deductions  allowed under  this\n     clause;\"\n     A cursory	and conjoint  reading of  section 10(2) (vi)\nand section  10(2) (xiv)  suggests that	 where	an  assessee\nincurs	expenditure   of  a  capital  nature  on  scientific\nresearch related to the business and the expenditure results\nin the	acquisition of	an asset,  the assessee	 can  claim,\nunder clause  (vi), a  deduction of the specified percentage\nof the	written down  value of	the asset   and under clause\n(xiv) he can ask for a deduction, in five consecutive years,\nof the expenditure he has incurred on the acquisition of the\nasset. For  this purpose, we are assuming that an asset used\nfor scientific research related to the business is also ipso\nfacto an  asset used  for the purpose of business. There has\nbeen some  debate before  us as to whether this is always so\nbut we need not enter into that controversy for the purposes\nof the present case.\n     It will  at once  be seen that, if these two provisions\nare applied   simultaneously, it would result in granting an\nassessee  a   double  allowance	  in  respect  of  the	same\nexpenditure -  one of  the entire amount over a period	of 5\nyears and  the other  a percentage of the expenditure over a\nnumber .  consecutive years  at a  graded scale	 as  already\nmentioned. The	question at  once leaps	 to the	 mind as  to\nwhether it  could have been the intention of the legislature\nto  permit   both  these  deductions  simultaneously  to  an\nassessee. The  provisions of  clauses (d)  and	(e)  of	 the\nproviso to  S.10(2) (xiv)  contain a  clue  to	answer	this\nquestion. More about it later.\n     We next  turn to  the provisions of 1961 Act. The topic\nof depreciation	 is dealt  with by section 32. Section 32(1)\n(ii) provides for depreciation. As under the 1922 Act, it is\nallowed at a percentage of the written down value of certain\ncapital assets	employed in  the  bussiness.  The  topic  of\nscientific research expenditure is dealt with by section 35.\nSection 35(1)  provides for  the deduction  of four types of\nexpenditure on	scientific	research  and  what  we	 are\nconcerned with is the deduction provided under section 35(1)\n(iv), which is to the following effect:\n     (iv) in  respect of any expenditure\n     of a  capital nature  on scientific\n     research related  to  the	business\n     carried on	 by the	 assessee,  such\n     deduction	as   may  be  admissible\n     under  the	    provisions	of  sub-\n     section (2).\"\n     Sub-section (2)  provides that,  for  the	purposes  of\nclause (iv)of  sub-section (1),	 one-fifth  of	the  capital\nexpenditure incurred  in any previous year shall be deducted\nfor that  previous year;  and the balance of the expenditure\nshall be  deducted in  equal instalments in each of the four\nimmediately  succeeding	  previous  years.   There   is	  an\nexplanation which  is not relevant for our present purposes.\nReading S.35(2) further, it provides in clauses (iv) and (v)\nas follows:\n     \"(iv) where  a deduction is allowed\n     for any  previous year  under  this\n     section in	 respect of  expenditure\n     represented wholly	 or partly by an\n     asset,  no	  deduction   shall   be\n     allowed under clauses (i), (ii) and\n     (iii) of sub-section (1) of section\n     32 for  the same  previous year  in\n     respect of that asset;\n     (v) where	the asset  mentioned  in\n     clause (ii) is used in the business\n     after it  ceases  to  be  used  for\n     scientific research related to that\n     business,	depreciation   shall  be\n     admissible under  clauses (i), (ii)\n     and  (iii)	  of  sub-section(1)  of\n     section 32.\"\nReference must	also be made to Explanation 1 to s. 43(1) in\nthis context. It read as follows at the relevant time:\n     \"Explanation:  Where  an  asset  is\n     used in business after it ceases to\n     be	 used  for  scientific	research\n     related  to  that	business  and  a\n     deduction	has  to	 be  made  under\n     clause (i),  clause (ii)  or clause\n     (iii) of  sub-section (I)	or  sub-\n     section  (1A)   of	 section  32  in\n     respect of	 that asset,  the actual\n     cost of  the asset to the assessee,\n     as reduced	 by the	 amount	 of  any\n     deduction allowed under clause (iv)\n     of sub-section (1) of section 35 or\n     under any	corresponding  provision\n     of the  Indian Income-tax Act, 1922\n     (11 of 1922).\"\n     From the  above it	 will be seen that the provisions of\nSection 32(1)  (ii) and	 Section 35(2) (i) (iv) and (v) read\nwith  Explanation   1  to   s.43(1)  virtually	 repeat	 the\nprovisions contained in Section 10(2) (vi) and 10(2)(xiv) of\nthe 1922  Act, so  that the  question  earlier	posed  still\nloomed in the  background of 1961 Act.\n     In 1968  there was	 an amendment  in the  provisions of\nSection 35(2).	The  sub-section  was  amended	to  read  as\nfollows:\n     \"(2) For  the  purposes  of  clause\n     (iv) of sub-section (1),-\n     (i) in  a case  where such	 capital\n     expenditure is  incurred before the\n     1st day  of April,	 1967, one-fifth\n     of the capital expenditure incurred\n     in	 any   previous	 year  shall  be\n     deducted for  that	 previous  year;\n     and the  balance of the expenditure\n     shall   be	   deducted   in   equal\n     instalments for  each of  the  four\n     immediately   succeeding	previous\n     years;\n     (i-a) in  a case where such capital\n     expenditure is  incurred after  the\n     31st day  of March, 1967, the whole\n     of	  such	  capital    expenditure\n     incurred in any previous year shall\n     be	 deducted   for	 that	previous\n     year.\"\n     The effect	 of this amendment was only to provided that\nthe  entire   amount  of  capital  expenditure	incurred  in\nrelation to  scientific research  was allowed as a deduction\nin one	year instead  of being	spread over a period of five\nyears as  was the  position earlier. This amendment does not\ntouch the   controversy	 in issue  before us  and it  has no\nsolution to offer to our present difficulty.\n     The provisions  of Section	 10(2) (vi) and (xiv) of the\nold Act	 had been administered between 1946 and 1962 and the\nprovisions of  Section 32  and 35  of the 1961 Act have been\nadministered since  1962. The  question	 whether an assessee\ncan  simultaneously  claim  an	allowance  or  deduction  in\nrespect of  the same  expenditure once	under Section 32 and\nagain in   Section 35 must have cropped up in some cases and\ndoes appear that such a double claim was put forward in some\ncases. The  contention on  behalf of  the assessees was that\nthe allowances	in respect  of depreciation  on the one hand\nand in respect of capital expenditure on scientific research\non the other are two totally different and independent heads\nof allowances.	 one  is a notional allowance to provide for\nthe wear  and tear  of	a  capital  asset  employed  in	 the\nbusiness as the years roll by; the other is an allowance for\nactual expenditure  of a  capital nature granted, on the eve\nof our	country&apos;s independence,	 in order  to give fillip to\nnew industrial innovations and the development of indigenous\nknow-how and  techniques by  proper planning on research and\ndevelopment by	various business  houses. It  is   therefore\nsuggested that	there is  nothing absurd  in construing	 the\nstatutes act  as providing  cumulatively for  both types  of\ndeductions in  respect of  the same  capital asset. The only\nlimitations on	this right are the two placed by the statute\nitself. The first limitation, contained in clause (d) of the\nproviso to  Section 10(2)  (xiv) and  s.35(2) (iv)  is	that\nboth the deductions cannot be claimed \"for the same previous\nyear\" in  respect of  the same	capital	 asset.	 The  second\nlimitation is found in clause (e) of the proviso  to Section\n10(2) (xiv)  and s.35(2)  (v) which  say that  if a  capital\nasset used  for scientific research ceases to be so used but\nis thereafter  brought into a  business for use therein, the\nactual cost for purposes of granting depreciation in respect\nof the asset thereafter should be taken as the amount of its\noriginal cost  reduced by  the amount  of deductions allowed\nunder Section  10(2) (xiv)  or s.35(2).	 In other words, the\ncontention of the assessee was and is that both the types of\nallowances are	permissible under  the statute except to the\nextent limited	by clauses  (d) and  (e) of  the proviso  to\nSection 10(2)  (xiv) of	 the  1922  Act	 and  reproduced  in\nclauses (iv) and (v) of	 Section 35(2) of the 1961 Act.\n     Before us	it is claimed on behalf of the assessee that\nthis interpretation  of the  statutory	provisions  is	very\nclear, patent  and unambiguous.	 It is	alleged that despite\nthis, some Income-tax Officers started disallowing the claim\nof depreciation	 in respect  of such  capital assets even in\nprevious years	during which  no deduction  was	 claimed  or\nallowed under Section 10(2) (xiv) or Section 35(2), contrary\nto the	clear language	of clause  (d) of  s.10(2) (xiv) and\ns.35(2) (iv). These Of orders were reversed on appeal either\nby the	Appellate Commissioner	or by  the Tribunal.  It was\nsuggested that	these decisions	 were almost  unanimously in\nfavour of  the assessee	 but the   department  persisted  in\npursuing the  matter upto  the stage of the High Court. Only\none reference  on this	topic came up before the High Courts\nand is	reflected in  the decision  of	the  Karnataka	High\nCourt, reported	 as CIT v. Indian Telephone Industries Ltd.,\n(1980) 126 I.T.R. 528. This was a reference of the year 1977\nmade at	 the instance  of the Commissioner of Income Tax and\nthe Commissioner of Income Tax lost this reference. The High\n(Sourt	re-affirmed   the  position  contended	for  by	 the\nassessee as  the one and only possible interpretation of the\nstatutory provisions. It is, therefore, contended that there\nwas, and  could have  been, no	doubt that  an assessee	 was\nentitled to  claim depreciation allowance in respect of such\nassets in  respect of  previous years  other than  those  in\nwhich an  allowance   had been allowed under the other head.\nWe shall revert later to this aspect of the matter.\n     At this stage, the Finance (No.2) Act, 1980 intervened.\nIt amended section 35(2) (iv) to read as follows:\n     \"(iv) where  a deduction is allowed\n     for any  previous year  under  this\n     section in	 respect of  expenditure\n     represented wholly	 or partly by an\n     asset,  no	  deduction   shall   be\n     allowed   under clauses  (i),  (ii)\n     and (iii)	of  sub-section	 (1)  of\n     section 32	 for  the  same	 or  any\n     other previous  year in  respect of\n     that asset.\"\n		      (Emphasis added)\n     The  Finance  Act	made  this  amendment  retrospective\nw.e.f. 1.4.62,	that is, the date of the commencement of the\n1961 Act.  This amendment is undoubtedly far-reaching in its\neffect.	 It   will  result  in	completion  of	the  pending\nassessments of	several years  on the  footing	of  the	 new\nprovision. It  will also involve re-opening or rectification\nof completed  assessments of  earlier years,  to the  extent\npermissible under the provisions of sections 148 and 154, in\ncases where  assessees had  been granted  \"double allowance\"\naccepting their	 contention at	the  time  of  the  original\nassessments. The  effect will be not for one assessment year\nbut for a number of assessment years in succession. Painting\na very	grim picture  of the  consequences  of	giving	full\nretrospective effect  to the  amendment, the  assessees	 say\nthat it will impose unexpected and impossible burden on them\nover the  years. jeopardise their solvency and lay them open\nto action  by creditor	and financial  institutions. Such an\nonerous burden, it is said. is unreasonable\nand  oppressive	 and  the  provision  imposing	such  burden\nviolates the  fundamental  rights  of  the  assessees  under\nArticles 14  and 19(1)	(g) of the Constitution of India. It\nis on  this plea  that, even  though assessments and appeals\nare pending in several of these cases, the petitioners chose\nto approach  this Court	 by  way  of  writ  petitions  under\nArticle 32  of	the  Constitution.  These  are	mostly	writ\npetitions of the year 1981 and are now coming up for hearing\nafter a period of 10 years.\n     Learned counsel  for the  assessees do  not contest the\ncompetence  of	 the  legislature   to	enact  the  impugned\nprovision, nor	do they dispute the right of the legislature\nto give	 retrospective effect  to statutory  provisions. The\ncontention only	 is that  retrospective	 provisions  may  be\npermissible   even in  taxing statutes	in  certain  special\ncircumstances such  as in  the case of provisions clarifying\nthe  impact   of  a  statute,  provisions  curing  defective\nlegislations in	 the light of the judicial decisions and the\nlike. They,  however, say that if the legislature chooses to\nimpose a  totally new  burden,	which  was  not	 at  all  in\ncontemplation	earlier	   and	 proceeds   to	 give	full\nretrospective effect  thereto, such  an	 attempt  should  be\nstruck	down   as    unreasonable  and	discriminatory.	 The\nprincipal questions, therefore, for our consideration are:\n     1)	 Were	the  earlier   statutory\n     provisions capable	 of  only    one\n     interpretation, namely, that placed\n     by the  assessees or  was there any\n     ambiguity in relation thereto ?\n     (2) If  there  was	 some  doubt  or\n     ambiguity	 about	  the	 earlier\n     legislation,  and	 the  1980   Act\n     clarified	 the   position	  by   a\n     retrospective amendment,  would  it\n     offend  the   provisions	of   the\n     Constitution ?\n     (3) If,  on  the  other  hand,  the\n     earlier provision	was  very  clear\n     and    capable    of    only    one\n     interpretation, as	 placed	 by  the\n     assessee,	 was   the   legislature\n     within its	 rights in  amending the\n     provision	retrospectively	  w.e.f.\n     1.4.62   and   thus   imposing   an\n     unreasonable  tax	 burden	 on  the\n     assessees?\n     Taking up	the first  of the three questions, it has to\nbe considered  from two	 angles, one  factual and the other,\nlegal. An  attempt was	made on behalf of the petitioners to\nproject an  image as  if the  interpretation  sought  to  be\nplaced by  the department on pre-1980 provisions to disallow\ndepreciation on such assets was so far-fetched that it never\nreceived the  approval of  the higher appellate authorities.\nIt was	suggested that	the appeals by assessees against the\ndisallowance invariably	 succeeded and it was the Department\nthat had  to move  the High Court on reference, the first of\nwhich references came up before the Karnataka High Court in\nC.l.T. v.  Indian Telephone  Industries	 (1980)	 126  I.T.R.\n548 and was answered against the Department. On the basis of\nsuch allegations  the petitioners attempted to make out that\nthe Department&apos;s  interpretation was  patently untenable and\nthat the  1980 amendment is not in the nature of a statutory\nclarification of  an ambiguity	but a  totally new and fresh\nimposition sought  to be  unjustifiably given  retrospective\neffect.\n     But, as Shri B.B. Ahuja has pointed out on the basis of\nthe averments  of the  petitioner in one of the cases, viz.,\nW.P.1153/81, the  impression sought  to be  created  by	 the\npetitioners does  not accord  with the	correct	 facts.	 The\nposition in  the case  is available  only as it stood at the\ntime when  the writ  petition and the counter affidavit were\nfiled	and   subsequent   developments	  are	not   known.\nNevertheless, the  picture that	 emerges is  this.  In	that\ncase, the  Income-tax  Officer	(I.T.O.)  is  said  to	have\nallowed depreciation on assets used for scientific research,\nfor the	 assessment year  1969-70, though  this is denied by\nthe department.	 The claim  was perhaps	 disallowed  by	 the\nI.T.O. for the assessment year 1970-71, but it was allowed\nby the	Allahabad Bench of the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal\n(I.T.A.T.) by  its order  dated 30.8.76.  For the assessment\nyear 1971-72,  the I.T.O.  disallowed the  depreciation. The\nAppellate Assistant  Commissioner (A.A.C.)  allowed it.	 The\ndepartment appealed to the Delhi Bench of the I.T.A.T. which\naccepted the department&apos;s plea by its order dated 13.8.79\n placing  reliance on the decision of a Special Bench of the\nI.T.A.T. It  has been  stated that  the	 assessee  filed  an\napplication for	 reference  to	the  High  Court  which	 was\npending when the writ petition was filed. For the assessment\nyears 1972-73  to 1974-75,  the assessments are pending as a\nstay order  had been  obtained for  reasons  which  are	 not\nknown. For  the assessment  years 1975-76  and 1976-77,	 the\nassessee claimed  depreciation	on  a  number  of  items  of\nscientific research  assets. The I.T.O. \"allowed\" the claims\nsubject to  the rider  that \"there  is no  provision to give\ndeduction of  more than	 100% of  the expenditure  by way of\ndepreciation\". The  assessee  appealed	to  Commissioner  of\nIncome-tax (Appeals)  who disallowed the claim. For 1977-78,\nthe l.T.O. disallowed the claim and the C.l.T. dismissed the\nassessee&apos;s appeals. For assessment years 1978-79 to 1980-81,\nthe assessments	 are stated  to be  pending. The above facts\nare sufficient to show that, atleast after 1.4.1968, - there\nis no  information before  us as  to  the  position  between\n1.4.1946 and  31.3.1968 -  the Department  has been  putting\nforward its  objections on  the issue  and that the same was\nthe subject  matter  of	 controversy  at  various  appellate\nstages, some  decided in  favour of,  and some	against, the\nassessee. A Special Bench of the l.T.A.T. had indeed decided\nthe issue  against the	assessee. In  this background, it is\nnot correct  to say  that the position was crystal clear and\nthat, save  for a  few ITOs  who took  a biassed  view,	 the\nauthorities were  all agreed that the Department&apos;s stand was\nuntenable. Some	 of the	 reported decisions  also show	that\nthere was  a live  controversy and that references have been\nmade to	 the  High  Court  both	 at  the  instances  or	 the\nassessees [see	Alkali &amp;  Chemical Corporation of India Ltd.\nv. C.l.T. (1986) 161 I.T.R. 820 (Cal.), and C.I.T. v. Indian\nExplosives Ltd.,  (1992) 192  I.T.R. 144 (Cal.)], as well as\nat the instance of the Revenue [see, C.I.T. v. International\nInstruments P. Ltd., (1983) 144 I.T.R. 936 (Kar.); C.I.T. v.\nMahindra Sintered Products Ltd. (1986) 161 I.T.R. 692 (Bom.)\nand Warner  Hindustan Ltd.  v. CIT,  (1988) 171	 I.T.R.	 224\n(A.P.)]. The petitioner&apos;s contention that, under the\n pre-amended  provisions, depreciation	on such	 assets	 was\nrecognised  allround   as  clearly  allowable  is  therefore\nrejected. We  have dealt  with this  aspect only  to meet an\naspect that  was urged. What is really important is the true\nand correct  interpretation of	those provisions,  not	what\nsomeone thought	 of it	then and to this aspect we shall now\nturn.\n \n     The second	 aspect of  the First of the three questions\nposed  earlier	 for  our  consideration  is  the  legal  or\ninterpretational aspect	 of the	 provisions  as	 they  stood\nprior to  the 1980  Amendment. Under  the provisions  of the\nstatute as  they stood	earlier, could	the  assessees	have\nclaimed continued  grant of depreciation after the expiry of\nfive previous  years before the 1968 amendment and after the\nexpiry or  the first  year after  the 1968  amendment,	even\nthough the  entire cost of the capital asset in question had\nbeen allowed  to  be  written  off  completely	against	 the\nbusiness  profits  of  those  five  previous  years  or	 one\nprevious year  as the  case may	 be? We	 think the answer to\nthis question  must emphatically  be in the negative. In our\nview, it is impossible to conceive of the legislature having\nenvisaged  a   double  deduction  in  respect  of  the	same\nexpenditure, even  though it  is true  that the two heads of\ndeduction do  not  completely  overlap	and  there  is	some\ndifference in  the rationale  of the  two  deductions  under\nconsideration. On behalf of the assessees reliance is placed\non the	following circumstances to support a contention that\nthe statute  did not  intend one  deduction to	preclude the\nother :\n     (i) lt  is pointed	 out that  s.10(2) (xiv) of the 1922\nAct, was  inserted in  1946 consequent on the insertion of a\ncorresponding  provision   in  the   United  Kingdom.	That\nprovision, viz. s.20(4) of the U.K. Finance Act, 1944\n read thus :\n     (4) Where	a deduction  is	 allowed\n     for any  year under  this	 or  the\n     last preceding  section in	 respect\n     of expenditure   represented wholly\n     or	 partly	  by  any   assets,   no\n     deduction	 shall be  allowed under\n     any provisions  of	 the  Income-tax\n     Act other	than this  part of  this\n     Act in  respect of	 wear and  tear,\n     obsolescence,    depreciation    or\n     exceptional depreciation  of  these\n     assets for	 any year  of assessment\n     during any	 part of  which they are\n     used by  the person carrying on the\n     trade   for   scientific	research\n     related to the trade. \"\n	  (emphasis supplied)\n     The Indian provision, it is said, has made a deliberate\ndeparture from	the said  provision and	 limited the  bar of\ndepreciation only  to those  previous years  during which  a\ndeduction is allowed under S.10(2) (xiv);\n     (ii) When	the Income-tax	Bill,  1961  was  under	 the\nconsideration of  the  Law  Commission,	 the  provisions  of\nS.10(2) (vi)  and (xiv) were carefully reviewed. But changes\nwere made  and the  provisions of the new Act in this regard\nwere drafted in pari materia with those of the old Act ;\n     (iii) The language used in clause (d) of the proviso to\nS.10(2)	 (xiv)	and  S.35(2)  (iv)  again  is  significantly\ndifferent from the language used in various other provisions\nof the	Act which,  in	like  contexts	of  possible  double\nallowances, emphatically  rule out  deductions in respect of\nthe same expense or exemptions in respect of the same income\nunder two  different provisions	 for the  same or  even	 any\nother assessment  year :  See, for  example, Sections  20(2)\n35B(2), 35C(2), 35CC(4), 35CCA(3), 35CCB(3), 35D(b), 35E(8),\n80GGA(4), 80HH(9A), 80HHA(7) and 80HHB(S); and\n     (iv) When the relevant provisions say that depreciation\nshall not be allowed in certain previous years, it permits a\ndisallowance only  in those  previous years  and  means,    The seeds of the present controversy were sown as early as in 1946. It is unfortunate that this matter should be coming up before this Court for its consideration nearly five decades later, though it must be pointed out that the issue in its present form is the outcome of an amendment made by the Finance (No.2) Act, 1980 (hereinafter referred to as \'the 1980 Act\') to the Income Tax Act, 1961* (hereinafter referred to as \'the 1961 Act\'). It is also a curious co-incidence that the 1980 Act effected two amendments in the 1961 Act with retrospective effect and the validity of both these provisions have been challenged before the courts. The first was the controversy with regard to the retrospective amendment of s.80-J which was settled by this Court by its decision in Lohia Machines Limited v. Union of India, (1985) 152 I.T.R. 308 (SC). It is the second amendment to the provisions contained in section 35(2) of the 1961 Act that has given rise to the present controversy between the parties.\r\n\r\nheld: So far as the arguments of taking away of vested rights is concerned, it is evident from the facts stated in the writ petition 1153/81 - which was treated as representative of the facts and contentions in all the writ petitions and with reference to which facts were arguments addressed itself that none of the assessments relating to any of the assessment years concerned herein has become final. They are pending at one or the other stage and in one or the other forum. I need not dilate upon this aspect inasmuch as the impugned amendment merely makes explicit what was implicit in the unamended clause, as explained hereinabove. In such a situation, the argument of any right vesting in the assessees is misplaced.\r\n\r\nThe writ petitions accordingly fail and are dismissed. No costs.\r\n\r\nPetitions  was dismissed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ','Sachalmal Parasram Vs Ratnabai And Ors. JUDGMENT S.M. Sikri, C.J.\r\n\r\n1. This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh dismissing the appeal filed by the appellant before us. The relevant facts for the determination of the points raised before us are as follows :\r\n\r\n2. Respondents Nos. 1, 2 and 3, who were the owners of the premises in dispute, mortgaged the premises in favour of respondent No. 4, with possession. Vide two mortgage deeds dated December 5, 1947 and October 26, 1948, for the amounts of 12,000/-and Rs. 4,000/- respectively. The date of payment was October 8, 1952, but by a subsequent agreement dated November 18, 1952, this was extended. The agreement further provided as follows :\r\n\r\nThe portion of the house in your side shall remain with you at a rental of Rs. 50/- per month. It was with you previously at Rs. 43/- per month. We shall not be responsible for any decrease or increase in the rental thereof. You shall have the right to let out the half portion of the shop on your side to any person at full rent\r\n\r\nOn May 1, 1958 respondent No. 4, the mortgagee in possession, filed a suit for foreclosure. During the pendency of this suit he let out the premises to the appellant at Rs. 55/- per month. It was provided in the rent agreement between the mortgagee and the appellant that &quot;incase the owner of the house gets the house released from mortgage under us, then I shall get the house vacated for you and hand it over to you.&quot; On September 28, 1960, a compromised decree for redemption was passed. The mortgagors, in execution of the said compromise decree, sought to take possession of the premises in dispute, which had been rented to the appellant. The appellant&#39;s objections under Order 21 Rule 97, CPC, were ultimately disallowed by the High Court, in revision, on April 18, 1964. The appellant then filed the present suit under Order 21, Rule 103, CPC for a declaration that &quot;the plaintiff (appellant) being the tenant of defendants Nos. 1, 2 and 3 (respondents) cannot be evicted unless eviction proceedings are taken against him under M.P. Premises Control Act.&quot; In the alternative, the appellant prayed for a declaration that &quot;if the plaintiff is considered to be the tenant of deft No. 4 even after the redemption decree the plaintiff cannot be evicted. He also prayed for a consequential permanent injunction. The Trial Court dismissed the suit. An appeal before the Additional District Judge also failed. As already mentioned, the second appeal before the High Court also failed.\r\n\r\n3. The learned Counsel for the appellant submitted that respondent No. 4, being the mortgagee in possession, had the right to let the premises in dispute both under Section 76 of the Transfer of Property Act, and under the agreement dated November 18, 1952. According to him, this act was an act prudent management and was binding on the respondents Nos. 1, 2 and 3. He further contended that he was protected by the provisions of the Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Control Act, 1961, and could not be evicted except in accordance with the provisions of that Act.\r\n\r\n4. The points raised by Mr. Naunit Lal are concluded by the decision of this Court in All India Film Corporation Ltd. v. Sri Rajagyan Nath : , which decision was unfortunately not brought to our notice during the course of the hearing. In this case the facts were similar. A mortgagee in possession had let out the premises, which was a cinema house, and the lessee had further sublet the same, to sub-les Sections On redemption the purchaser\r\n Property - Mortgage - Section 76(a) of Transfer of Property Act, 1882 - High Court expelled Appeal documented by Appellant for assertion that Plaintiff being an occupant can not be removed unless ousting procedures are taken against him and furthermore petitioned God for significant lasting directive - Hence, this Appeal - Whether, demonstration of rent was not demonstration of judicious administration - Held, long rent on such little lease was not demonstration of reasonability - However, Section 76(a) of Act expressed that demonstrations done genuine and wisely in common course of administration bound even after end of title of mortgagee under lock and key - Moreover, lease deed itself stipulated that renter would empty house and hand over same to Respondent on the off chance that proprietor of House got house discharged from home loan - There was no landowner and no inhabitant - Therefore arrangements of Rent Restriction Act couldn&#39;t matter - Appeal rejected.\r\n Disposed off','Hira Lal Rattan Lal Etc.

They  raise\ncommon questions of law for decision, and they are  directed\nagainst a common judgment of the Allahabad High Court.\nThe  facts  of the case lie within a  narrow  compass.	 The\nappellants  are dealers in foodgrains including cereals	 and\npulses	especially  split or processed foodgrains  and	dal.\nThe dispute in this case centers round the question  whether\nthe  Government	 is  competent	to  levy  sales-tax  on	 the\npurchases   made  by  the  appellants  of  split   processed\nfoodgrains  and	 dal  under the	 provisions  of	 the  United\nProvinces  Sales  Tax  Act, 1948 as  amended  by  the  Uttar\nPradesh	 Sales Tax Act (Amendment and Validation) Act,	1970\n(which will hereinafter be referred to as the Act).\nUnder  the Sales Tax Act as it originally stood	 which	will\n-hereinafter  be  referred  to as the  principal  Act),	 the\npurchases  of  split  or processed  foodgrains	and  dal  by\ndealers	 were sought, to be brought to tax under s.  3-D  of\nthe  principal Act read with the notification  issued.	 The\nvalidity  of the levy was challenged by Tilock Chand  Prasan\nKumar,	the appellant in Civil Appeal NO&apos;. 1625 of  1971  in\nrespect	 of  the assessment made on him for  the  assessment\nyear  1966-67  by assessment order dated June  30,  1968  by\nmeans of a writ petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution.\nThe  High  Court of Allahabad struck down the  levy  holding\nthat the dal purchased by the petitioner before it could not\nbe  said  to be a commodity essentially different  from	 the\narhar  dal  purchased by the dal mills and  accordingly	 the\npurchases effected by the petitioner could not be  regarded\nas  the first purchases.  This decision is reported  in	 25,\nS.T.C.	p. 118.	 Thereafter the Governor of U.P.  issued  an\nordinance  known as Uttar Pradesh Sales Tax  (Amendment	 and\nValidation) Ordinance, 1970 (U.P. Ordinance\n \nNo. 2 of 1970) adding inter alia Explanation 11 to s. 3-D as\nwell as s. 7 to the principal Act.  This ordinance was later\non  enacted  as	 an  Act  to  which  we	 have  already	made\nreference.  The provisions of the Amending Act are identical\nwith the provisions in the Ordinance.  Though at the time of\nthe  institution  of  the writ petitions  from	which  these\nappeals arise, the Ordinance had not yet been made into	 the\nAct, the Amending Act came into force during the pendency of\nthe writ petitions.  Hence we shall refer to the  provisions\nof the Amending Act.\n	      Under the principal Act a dealer is defined in\n	      s.  2(c)	as \" \"dealer\" means  any  person  or\n	      association   of	persons	 carrying   on	 the\n	      business	of buying or selling goods in  Uttar\n	      Pradesh, whether for commission,	remuneration\n	      or  otherwise, and includes any firm or  Hindu\n	      Joint   Family  and  any	society,   club	  or\n	      association  which sells goods to its  members\n	      and also includes any department of the  State\n	      Government  or  the Central  Government  which\n	      carries  on such business and any	 undertaking\n	      engaged  in the generation or distribution  of\n	      electrical energy or any other form of power.\"\n	      (Explanation  to the section is  not  relevant\n	      for our present purpose).\n	      Section 3 of the Act provides for the levy  of\n	      multi-point tax.	The portion of that  section\n	      which  is	 material for  our  present  purpose\n	      reads :\n	      \"Subject to the provisions of this Act,  every\n	      dealer shall, for each assessment year, pay a\n	      lax at the rate of two naye paise per rupee on\n	      his  turnover  of such year,  which  shall  be\n	      determined   in	such  manner   as   may	  be\n	      prescribed\"\n	      Section  3-A  provides  for  a  single   point\n	      taxation in respect of sale of certain  goods.\n	      At  present we are only concerned with  s.  3-\n	      D(1).  It provides :\n	      \"Except as provided in sub-section (2),  there\n	      shall be levied and paid, for each  assessment\n	      year  or part thereof, a tax on the  turnover,\n	      to  be  determined in such manner	 as  may  be\n	      prescribed,  of  first  purchases	 made  by  a\n	      dealer  or  through  a  dealer,  acting  as  a\n	      purchasing  agent in respect of such goods  or\n	      class  of	 goods,	 and  at  such	rates,	 not\n	      exceeding	 two paise per rupee in the case  of\n	      foodgrains, including cereals and pulses,	 and\n	      five  paise  per rupee in the  case  of  other\n	      goods and with effect from such date, as	may,\n	      from  time to time, be notified by the,  State\n	      Government in this behalf.\"\n	      (Explanation 1 to this section is not relevant\n	      for our purpose).\n \nThe notification issued under s. 3-D of the principal Act on\nOctober	 1,  1964 (Notification No. S. T.  7122/X)  provided\nthat  with  effect  from October 1, 1964,  the	turnover  of\npurchases  in  respect of goods mentioned therein  shall  be\nliable to tax under s. 3-D at the rate mentioned:\n\"Foodgrains    1.5 paise per rupee on first purchase\nOn  the	 basis	of s. 3-D read	with  the  notification,  as\nmentioned  earlier, the authorities under the Act sought  to\nbring to tax under the principal Act the first purchases  of\nprocessed  or split foodgrains including dal on	 the  ground\nthat  they constituted a separate item of  foodgrains  quite\nindependent  of the unprocessed or unsplit foodgains.	This\nview, as seen above, was negatived by the High Court.  After\nthe  decision  of  the High Court,  the	 principal  Act	 was\namended.   Under  the.	Amending Act  one  more	 Explanation\nviz., Explanation 11 was added to s. 3-D.\n	      \"For  the purposes of this sub-section,  split\n	      or  processed foodgrains, such as in the	form\n	      of  dal shall be deemed to be  different	from\n	      unsplit	or   unprocessed   foodgrains,	 and\n	      accordingly, nothing in this sub-section shall\n	      be  construed to prevent the imposition,	levy\n	      or  collection  of the tax in respect  of	 the\n	      first   purchases	  of  split   or   processed\n	      foodgrains  merely because. tax had  been	 im-\n	      posed  levied or collected earlier in  respect\n	      of the first purchases of those foodgrains  in\n	      their unsplit or unprocessed form.\"\n	      The  Amending  Act  also	added  a  validating\n	      provision to the principal Act viz. s. 7. That\n	      section reads :\n	      \"Notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order\n	      of  any  court or tribunal  to  the  contrary,\n	      every  notification  issued or  purporting  to\n	      have been issued under Section 3-A or  Section\n	      3-D  of  the  principal Act  before  the	com-\n	      mencement of this Act shall be deemed to	have\n	      been  issued under that section as amended  by\n	      this  Act and shall be so interpreted  and  be\n	      deemed to be and always to have been as  valid\n	      as if the provisions of this Act were in force\n	      at   all	material  times;   and	 accordingly\n	      anything	done or any action taken  (including\n	      any order made, proceeding taken, jurisdiction\n	      exercised,  assessment  made, or	tax  levied,\n	      collected or paid purporting to have been done\n	      or   taken   in	pursuance   of	 any	such\n	      notification)  shall  be	deemed	to  be,	 and\n	      always to have been, validly and lawfully done\n	      or taken.\"\n	      It will be necessary later on to consider what\n	      was the vice that the legislature intended  to\n	      cure by the Amending Act.	 The\n	      --L498Sup Cl/73\n \n	      sequence	 of  events  itself  discloses	 the\n	      purpose  of  the	Ordinance  as  well  as	 the\n	      Amending	Act.  That apart, the  statement  of\n	      objects  and  reasons which  can	be  usefully\n	      looked  into  for the purpose of	finding	 the\n	      vice  that  the  legislature  was	 trying	  to\n	      provide against reads thus\n	      \"Sections	 3-A and 3-D of the U.P.  Sales	 Tax\n	      Act,  1948 provide for single point  taxation.\n	      Under the fondler section the tax is levied on\n	      the turnover of sales, while under the  latter\n	      the  tax	is levied on the turnover  of  first\n	      purchases.  Plain and ornamented glass bangles\n	      are subject to tax separately under section 3-\n	      A.   Similarly, unsplit and split	 pulses	 are\n	      separately  subject to tax under section	3-D.\n	      It has been held by the High Court in one case\n	      that tax cannot be levied separately on  plain\n	      and ornamented glass bangles under section 3-A\n	      and  in  another	that tax  cannot  be  levied\n	      separately  on unsplit and split pulses  under\n	      section  3-D  because in their  opinion  plain\n	      glass  bangles are not a	commodity  different\n	      from  ornamented glass bangles  and  similarly\n	      unsplit  pulses and split pulses are also	 not\n	      two  different commodities.   These  judgments\n	      have   created  legal  difficulties   in	 the\n	      assessment  and  collection  of  tax  on	 the\n	      aforesaid	 commodities.  Besides, the  dealers\n	      have  started applying for the refund  of	 tax\n	      already collected on these commodities.	Ibis\n	      will have serious repercussions on the State&apos;s\n	      revenue.	Accordingly, it is proposed to amend\n	      sections	3-A and 3-D to provide for the	levy\n	      of   tax	on  the	 aforesaid  commodities	  as\n	      separate	items.

They further  took	 the\n	      plea that the amendments incorporated were not\n	      effective	 enough	 to bring to tax  the  first\n	      purchases of split or processed foodgrains and\n	      pulses.	 The  High  Court   rejected   these\n	      contentions and dismissed the writ  petitions.\n	      Thereafter  these	 appeals have  been  brought\n	      after  obtaining	certificates from  the	High\n	      Court.\n	      The  validity  of	 the levy  in  question	 was\n	      challenged on the following grounds&apos;:\n	      (1)   That  no fresh levy can be imposed by  a\n	      retrospective legislation;\n \n	      (2)   That  the legislature cannot in case  of\n	      legislation  of the nature with which  we	 are\n	      concerned,    separate	into	 independent\n	      commodities   split  and	unsplit	 pulses	  or\n	      processed	 or unprocessed pulses and  on	that\n	      footing  seek to impose tax twice over on	 the\n	      same commodity in respect of the goods  liable\n	      to be taxed at a single point;\n	      (3)   That  the newly added Explanation to  s.\n	      3-D read with s. 7 of the Amending Act amounts\n	      to an unlawful usurpation of judicial power by\n	      the legislature;\n	      (4)   The newly added Explanation II to s. 3-D\n	      is violative of Art. 14 of the  Constitution\n	      There  is	 no rational  basis  for  separating\n	      split  or	 processed pulses  from	 unsplit  or\n	      unprocessed pulses;\n	      (5)   On a true construction of Explanation It\n	      to s. 3-D no fresh charge can be held to	have\n	      been imposed,\n	      (6)   No	levy  of purchase tax  can  be	made\n	      without a fresh Notification under s. 3-D read\n	      with Explanation 11 showing therein separately\n	      foodgrains  unsplit or unprocessed as well  as\n	      foodgrains split or processed; and\n	      (7)   That   the	 power	conferred   on	 the\n	      Government   under  s.  3-D  amounts   to	  an\n	      excessive delegation of legislative power. and\n	      consequently void.\nThe  source  of	 the  legislative power	 to  levy  sales  or\npurchase  tax  on goods is Entry 54 of the List	 II  of	 the\nConstitution.	 It   is  well	settled	 that	subject	  to\nconstitutional restrictions a power to legislate includes  a\npower to legislate prospectively as well as retrospectively.\nIn this regard legislative power to impose tax also includes\nwithin	itself	the power to  tax  retrospectively--see	 The\nUnion of India v. Madan Gopal Kabra;(1) M. P.  Sundararamier\n&amp;  Co. v. The State of Andhra Pradesh and Anr. (2) ;  J.  K.\nJute Mills Co. Ltd. v.

(5)\nIn the last mentioned case it was specifically decided	that\nwhere  the legislature can make a valid law, it can  provide\nnot  only  for	the prospective operation  of  the  material\nprovisions  of the said law but it can also provide for	 the\nretrospective operation of the said provisions.\nWe see no force in the second contention advanced on  behalf\nof  the	 appellants.  As seen earlier the  general  rule  as\nenunciated in s. 3 is multi point tax sales tax or  purchase\ntax; but power\n(1) [1954] S. C. R. 541.\n(2)  [1958] S. C. R. 1422.\n(3)  12.

Legislature  was	 not  incompetent  to  separate	 the\nprocessed  or split pulses from the unsplit  or	 unprocessed\npulses and treat the two as separate and independent goods.\nIn  Jagannath and Ors. v. Union of India,(1) question  arose\nfor  decision  whether	it was open to	the  legislature  to\nimpose	separate excise duty on tobacco leaf as well  as  on\nbroken leaf of tobacco.	 This Court overruled the contention\nthat  such a levy was invalid. It head that it was open	 for\nthe legislature to separate the two items.  We see no  basis\nfor  the  contention  that the legislature  cannot  for	 the\npurpose of tax under the Act separate the split or processed\nPulses	from the unsplit or unprocessed.  The power  of	 the\nlegislature  to specify the nature of the goods the sale  or\npurchase of which, it will bring to tax is very wide.\nNow coming to point No. 3, there is no justification for the\ncontention  that  the legislature has usurped  any  judicial\npower.	The legislature has not purported either directly or\nby  necessary implication to overrule the decisions  of	 the\nAllahabad  High.  Court in Tilok Chand Prasan  Kumar&apos;s	case\n(supra).   On the other hand it. has accepted tha Under the U.P.

The contest  before  us  is\nconfined  to the quantum of compensation and, although	Shri\nVasudeva Pillai, counsel for the appellants&apos; has pressed his\npoints	with persistence, we are unable to disturb the	High\nCourt&apos;s award.\nThe land, vast in extent, had a building with a plinth	area\nof  3,300 sq. yds.  The area in which the acquired  plot  is\nsituate	 is  perhaps an important one in  the  City.   After\ngetting	 expert	 valuation  made of  the  buildings  by	 the\nCentral	 Public	 Works Department engineers,  the  Collector\nawarded a sum of Rs. 41,674/- for the buildings, Rs. 1,440/-\nfor the standing trees and a sum of Rs. 30,630/for a belt of\nland  50  ft.  deep  at Rs. 15/- per  square  yard  and	 Rs.\n99,435/-  for  the remaining area of 13,258 sq.	 yds.	The,\ntotal figure together with statutory solarium granted by the\nCollector was Rs. 1,99,155.85. This figure fell far short of\nthe ambitious claim of the appellant and, when the case came\nbefore	the  City Civil Court on a reference, there  was  an\nenhancement   of   compensation.    Although   the   learned\nAdditional Chief Judge held that the area was a little	less\nthan had been determined by the Collector, the market  value\nof the building was increased nearly four fold on the  basis\nof  a multiple of 25 times the rent fetched.  On  the  other\nitems also some changes were made and, consequentially,	 the\ntotal  amount was raised to Rs. 3,31,092/-.   The  appellant\narrived	 in  the High Court asking for more (and  the  State\nalso appears to have appealed, but its appeal was  dismissed\nand we are not therefore concerned with it).\nSome  measure of good fortune attended the appeal since	 the\nHigh Court altered the multiple from 25 to 27 in fixing	 the\ncompensation for the building.	Otherwise, it  substantially\naffirmed the findings of the trial Court, except that to the\nadvantage  of the appellant it restored the  area  acquired.\nThe net result was the appellant obtained a total sum of Rs.\n3,52,326.65 as compensation.\nIt is thus clear that from the Collector to the Civil  Court\nand  on, to the High Court. there has been an escalation  in\nthe  amount  of compensation and, hopefully, the  owner	 has\nreached	 this  Court with his appeal,  under  a	 certificate\nwhich  he  secured under Art. 133(1)(a)	 before	 the  recent\namendment.  We mention this because we are unable to discern\nany  substantial  question of law of general  importance  in\ncounsel&apos;s   submissions	 or  the  points  outlined  in	 the\nmemorandum of appeal which merits the consideration of	this\nCourt.\n \nMerely	because the claim is large the judgment need not  be\nlong  :and,  although  the appellant tried  to	spread	the,\ncanvas	 wide,	 we   regard   the   points   deserving	  of\nconsideration-as  falling  within  a  narrow  compass.	 The\nburden	of  the song has been that Hyderabad has,  for	his-\ntorical	 reasons,  become  a great city and  that  the	land\nacquired has precious potential value which has not  entered\nthe  judicial computation at the lesser levels. (By  way  of\naside  one, may say that society economic development  of  a\nCity-  may  enhance  the  value of  space  without  any	 the\nlittlest contribution by its owner and it is, in one  sense,\nunfair	that  society should pay to an individual  a  higher\nprice  not  because he has-earned it but  because  of  other\ndevelopmental factors.	Of course, we are concerned with the\nLand  Acquisition  Act as it is and this  thought  therefore\nneed not be pursued).  Counsel has also urged that the	land\nand the building taken together had a personality of its own\nand  therefore a special value, missed by the courts  below,\nshould	be ascribed and the methodology of breaking  up	 the\ntotality  into	buildings  and	lands  separately  This appeal, by certificate, arises out of land acquisition proceedings under the Hyderabad Land Acquisition Act (Hyderabad Act IX of 1309 Fasli) (hereinafter called the Act, for short) which substantially resembles the provisions of the Central Land Acquisition Act. The Government of Andhra Pradesh acquired a large open area with some buildings thereon by Notification, dated January 3, 1957 with a view to construct Income-tax add Central Excise Offices at Hyderabad. The contest before us is confined to the quantum of compensation and, although Shri Vasudeva Pillai, counsel for the appellants\' has pressed his points with persistence, we are unable to disturb the High Court\'s award. The land, vast in extent, had a building with a plinth area of 3,300 sq. yds. The area in which the acquired plot is situate is perhaps an important one in the City. After getting expert valuation made of the buildings by the Central Public Works Department engineers, the Collector awarded a sum of Rs. 41,674/- for the buildings, Rs. 1,440/- for the standing trees and a sum of Rs. 30,630/for a belt of land 50 ft. deep at Rs. 15/- per square yard and Rs. 99,435/- for the remaining area of 13,258 sq. yds. The, total figure together with statutory solarium granted by the Collector was Rs. 1,99,155.85. This figure fell far short of the ambitious claim of the appellant and, when the case came before the City Civil Court on a reference, there was an enhancement of compensation. Although the learned Additional Chief Judge held that the area was a little less than had been determined by the Collector, the market value of the building was increased nearly four fold on the basis of a multiple of 25 times the rent fetched. On the other items also some changes were made and, consequentially, the total amount was raised to Rs. 3,31,092/-. The appellant arrived in the High Court asking for more (and the State also appears to have appealed, but its appeal was dismissed and we are not therefore concerned with it). Some measure of good fortune attended the appeal since the High Court altered the multiple from 25 to 27 in fixing the compensation for the building. Otherwise, it substantially affirmed the findings of the trial Court, except that to the advantage of the appellant it restored the area acquired. The net result was the appellant obtained a total sum of Rs. 3,52,326.65 as compensation. It is thus clear that from the Collector to the Civil Court and on, to the High Court. there has been an escalation in the amount of compensation and, hopefully, the owner has reached this Court with his appeal, under a certificate which he secured under Art. 133(1)(a) before the recent amendment. Court mention this because court is unable to discern any substantial question of law of general importance in counsel\'s submissions or the points outlined in the memorandum of appeal which merits the consideration of this Court.\r\n\r\nHeld: Court is satisfied with the valuation of the rented portion of the house adopted by the High Court is correct. Shri Pillai argued in vain for an augmentation of the value on the potential user of the plot for a Cinema House. This story has been factually disbelieved by the Courts below and we cannot reopen the matter. Court must also remember that the Court below has been indulgent enough to adopt a multiple of 27 despite the fact that the buildings acquired are over 30 years old. Nor does it come with grace from the appellant to contend against the belting method since he himself had asked for its application before the Collector and the trial Court.\r\n\r\nCourt is thus satisfied that there is no law, no fact, which comes to the rescue of the appellant and his appeal, virtually against concurrent findings of fact, therefore deserves to be, and is hereby, dismissed with costs. ','Daya Singh Lahoria Vs Union Of India And Ors With\nSpecial Leave Petition (Crl.) Nos. 2697-2698  of 2000.\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nPATTANAIK,J.\nLITTTTTTTJ\n\n    The Writ Petition and the Special Leave Petitions raised\nthe common question, and as such were heard together and are\ndisposed  of by this common judgment.  The grievance of	 the\npetitioner Daya Singh Lahoria, in the Writ Petition is, that\nthe  Criminal Courts in the country have no jurisdiction  to\ntry  in respect of offences which do not form a part of	 the\nextradition  judgment by virtue of which the petitioner	 has\nbeen  brought  to this country and he can be tried only	 for\nthe  offences  mentioned  in the  Extradition  Decree.	 The\npetitioner  has	 also  prayed for quashing of  the  FIR	 and\ncharge	sheet  against	him which are not  included  in	 the\nextradition judgment of the USA Court.	It appears, that the\nUnited	States District of Texas Fort Worth Division  issued\nthe  judgment  of certification of extraditability  and	 the\nsaid  decree  certifies to sustain under Extradition  Treaty\nbetween	 the  United  States  and  the	United	Kingdom	 and\nNorthern  Ireland  with the Government of Republic of  India\nand  specifies the offences for which the accused, mentioned\nin  the	 extradition  order  could  be	tried.	 It  is	 the\ncontention of the petitioner that he cannot be tried for the\noffences   other   than	 the   offences	 mentioned  in	 the\nextradition  order  as	that  would be	a  contravention  of\nSection	  21  of  the  Extradition   Act  as  well  as	 the\ncontravention of the provisions of the International Law and\nthe very Charter of Extradition Treaty.\n\n    The	 Special Leave Applications are directed against the\norder of Rajasthan High Court wherein the High Court refused\nto  entertain  a  Habeas  Corpus  Petition  and	 decide	 the\nquestion  as  to  the jurisdiction of the  Designated  Court\nunder  the  provisions	of   the  Terrorist  and  Disruptive\nActivities  (Prevention)  Act, 1987, on the ground  that  an\nobjection  to  the  said jurisdiction could  be	 made  under\nSection	 18 of the Act before the very Designated Court	 and\nan application for issuance of a Writ of Habeas Corpus would\nnot lie.  The question for consideration in the said Special\nLeave  Petitions,  therefore, is whether an accused, who  is\nbeing  tried  in respect of offences under  the	 Extradition\nTreaty	can  be tried for any other offence which  does	 not\nform  a part of the decree in view of the specific provision\ncontained in Section 21 of the Extradition Act, 1962.\n\n    To	consolidate  and  amend	 the  law  relating  to	 the\nextradition of fugitive criminals and to provide for matters\nconnected  therewith, or incidental thereto, the Extradition\nAct of 1962 has been enacted.  Prior to the enactment of the\naforesaid  law of extradition applicable to India was  found\nscattered in the United Kingdom Extradition Act of 1870, the\nFugitive Offenders Act, 1881 and the Indian Extradition Act,\n1903.	The expression extradition means, surrender by one\nState  to  another of a person desired to be dealt with	 for\ncrimes	 of  which  he	has   been  accused  and  which	 are\njusticiable  in the Courts of the other States.	 The  rights\nof  a  citizen	not to be sent out to  foreign	jurisdiction\nwithout	 strict compliance with law relating to	 extradition\nis  a valuable right.  This Extradition Act is a special law\ndealing	 with criminals and accused of certain crimes and it\nprescribes the procedure for trial as well as the embargo in\ncertain contingencies.	The expression extradition offence\nhas  been  defined in Section 2 (c) of the Act to  mean,  in\nrelation  to  a	 foreign  State, being a  treaty  State,  an\noffence	 punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall\nnot  be	 less than one year under the laws of India or of  a\nforeign	 State	and  includes  a  composite  offence.	 The\nexpression  extradition Treaty has been defined in Section\n2(d)  to  mean, a treaty (agreement or arrangement) made  by\nIndia  with  a foreign State relating to the extradition  of\nfugitive  criminals and includes any treaty relating to	 the\nextradition  of fugitive criminals made before the 15th	 day\nof August, 1947, which extends to, and is binding on, India.\nThe  expression	 foreign State is defined in Section  2(e)\nincludes   any	State  outside	 India	and  includes  every\nconstituent  part,  colony  or	dependency  of	such  State.\nSection	 21  of	 the  Extradition Act is  relevant  for	 our\npurpose.\n\n    Section  21, as it stood in the Extradition Act of	1962\nis extracted hereinbelow in extenso:\n\n    Section 21:	 Accused or convicted person surrendered or\nreturned  by foreign State or Commonwealth country not to be\ntried  for previous offence:- Whenever any person accused or\nconvicted  of an offence, which if committed in India, would\nbe  an extradition offence, is surrendered or returned by  a\nforeign	 State	or Commonwealth country, that  person  shall\nnot, until he has been restored or has had an opportunity of\nreturning to that State or country, be tried in India for an\noffence	 committed  prior to the surrender or return,  other\nthan  the  extradition offence proved by the facts on  which\nthe surrender or return is based.\n\n    This  section  is  based  on Section 19  of	 the  United\nKingdom Extradition Act, 1870.	The original Act of 1962 was\namended	 by  Act  66  of  1993.	   Under  the  1962  Act,  a\ndistinction   had  been	  maintained  between	Commonwealth\ncountries  and	foreign States and the foreign	States	were\nconsidered   as	 treaty	 States.    The	  extradition	with\nCommonwealth  countries	 were  separately  governed  by	 the\nSecond	Schedule  of the Act and the Central Government	 was\ngiven	power	under  Chapter	 III  to  conclude   special\nextradition   arrangements  with   respect  to	Commonwealth\ncountries  only.   The amended Act of 1993 enables India  to\nconclude  extradition  treaty with foreign State,  including\nthe   Commonwealth   countries,	   without   treating	them\nstructurally  different.  It provides for  extra-territorial\njurisdiction  over  foreigners for crimes committed by	them\noutside	 India and it incorporates composite offences in the\ndefinition  of	extradition offence.  It excludes  political\noffences  as  a	 defence in cases of offences of  a  serious\nnature	and  it covers extradition requests on the basis  of\ninternational  convention.   It	 also  enables	the  Central\nGovernment  to	make  and receive requests  for	 provisional\narrest	of fugitives in urgent cases pending the receipt  of\nthe  formal extradition request.  Section 21 of 1962 Act was\nsubstituted by Act 66 of 1993, as follows:\n\n\n    Section 21	Accused or convicted person surrendered or\nreturned  by  foreign  State  not to be	 tried	for  certain\noffences.   - Whenever any person accused or convicted of an\noffence,   which,  if  committed  in   India  would  be	  an\nextradition offence, is surrendered or returned by a foreign\nState,	such person shall not, until he has been restored or\nhas  had an opportunity of returning to that State, be tried\nin India for an offence other than.\n\n    (a)	 the extradition offence in relation to which he was\nsurrendered or returned;  or\n\n    (b) any lesser offence disclosed by the facts proved for\nthe  purposes of securing his surrender or return other than\nan  offence in relation to which an order for his  surrender\nor return could not be lawfully made;  or\n\n    (c)	 the  offence in respect of which the foreign  State\nhas given its consent.\n\n    The	  provision   of  the	aforesaid   Section   places\nrestrictions  on  the trial of the person extradited and  it\noperates  as a bar to the trial of the fugitive criminal for\nany  other  offence  until the condition of  restoration  or\nopportunity  to return is satisfied.  Under the amended	 Act\nof 1993, therefore, a fugitive could be tried for any lesser\noffence,  disclosed  by	 the facts proved or  even  for	 the\noffence	 in respect of which the foreign State has given its\nconsent.   It thus, enables to try the fugitive for a lesser\noffence, without restoring him to the State or for any other\noffence, if the State concerned gives its consent.  In other\nwords,	it may be open for our authorities to obtain consent\nof  the	 foreign  State to try the fugitive  for  any  other\noffence	 for  which  the extradition decree might  not	have\nmentioned,  but	 without obtaining such consent, it  is	 not\npossible  to  try  for	any other offence,  other  than	 the\noffence	 for which the extradition decree has been obtained.\nThe  Extradition  Treaty contains several articles of  which\nArticle	 7 is rather significant for our purpose, which	 may\nbe quoted hereinbelow in extenso:-\n\n    Article 7.	A person surrendered can in no case be kept\nin  custody or be brought to trial in the territories of the\nHigh  Contracting Party to whom the surrender has been	made\nfor  any other crime or offence, or on account of any  other\nmatters,  than	those for which the extradition	 shall	have\ntaken  place,  until  he has been restored, or	has  had  an\nopportunity  of	 returning, to the territories of  the	High\nContracting Party by whom he has been surrendered.\n\n    This  stipulation  does n Removal Act, 1962 - Section 21 - an outlaw brought into this nation under an Extradition Decree can be attempted just for the offenses specified in the Extradition Decree and for no other offense and the Criminal Courts of this nation will have no purview to attempt such outlaw for whatever other offense. ','State Of T.N Vs Ananthi Ammal The Judgmenttt of the Court was delivered by S.P. BHARUCHA, J.-\r\n\r\nCivil Appeal No. 3312 of 1981\r\n\r\n1.This appeal by special leave is filed by the State of Tamil Nadu against the judgment and order of the High Court of Madras dated 9-9-1981, where by the Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for Harijan Welfare Schemes Act, 1978, was struck down as being ultra vires the Constitution of India. The High Court came to the conclusion that the said Act did not enjoy the protection of Articles 31-C or 31-A and that it was violative of Articles 14, 19 and 300-A of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n2.Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the said Act was not violative of Article 14 or Article 19 or Article 300-A and that, in any event, it was protected by reason of Article 31 A. Learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the said Act was violative of Article 14 inasmuch as it was enacted to acquire lands for a purpose which could as well be served by the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, and that a comparison of the provisions of the said Act with those of the Land Acquisition Act showed that the provisions of the said Act were far harsher insofar as the landowner was concerned. Learned counsel for the respondents also submitted that the said Act did not enjoy the protection conferred by Article 31-C notwithstanding the declaration in that behalf contained in Section 2 thereof.\r\n\r\n3.The said Act contains in Section 2 the declaration aforementioned, namely, that it is enacted to give effect to the policy of the State towards securing the principles laid down in Part IV and, in particular, Article 46 of the Constitution. It is enacted to provide for acquisition of land for Harijan Welfare Schemes.\r\n\r\n4.Section 3 of the said Act is the definition section. It defines &#39;Court&#39; to mean, in the city of Madras, the Madras City Civil Court and elsewhere, the Subordinate Judge&#39;s Court having jurisdiction, and if there is no such Subordinate Judge&#39;s Court, the District Court having jurisdiction. A &quot;Harijan Welfare Scheme&quot; is defined to mean any scheme for provision of house sites for Harijans, for constructing, extending or improving any dwelling house for Harijans, for providing any burial or burning ground for Harijans, for providing any pathway leading to such dwelling house, burial or burning ground or for providing any other amenity for the benefit of Harijans. Sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the said Act read thus:\r\n\r\n&quot;4. Power to acquire land.- (1) Where the District Collector is satisfied that for the purpose of any Harijan Welfare Scheme, it is necessary to acquire any land, he may acquire the land by publishing in the District Gazette a notice to the effect that he has decided to acquire the land in pursuance of this section. (2)Before publishing a notice under sub- section (1), the District Collector or any officer authorised by the District Collector in this behalf, shall call upon the owner or any other person, who, in the opinion of the District Collector or the officer so authorised may be interested in such land, to show cause why it should not be acquired. (3)(a) The District Collector may, where he has himself called upon the owner or other person to show cause under sub-section (2), pass such orders as he may deem fit on the cause so shown;\r\n\r\n(b)Where any officer authorised by the District Collector has called upon the owner or other person to show cause under sub- section (2), the officer so authorised shall make a report to the District Collector containing his recommendations on the cause so shown for the decision of the District Collector. After considering such report the District Collector may pass such orders as he may deem fit.\r\n\r\n5.Land acquired to vest in Government free from all encumbrances.- When a notice under sub-section (1) of Section 4 is published in the District Gazette, the land to which the said notice relates shall, on and from the date on which the notice is so published vest absolutely in the Government free from all encumbrances.\r\n\r\n6.Right to receive amount.- Every person having any interest in any land acquired under this Act shall be entitled to receive and be paid an amount as hereinafter provided.\r\n\r\n7.Determination of amount.- (1) The amount payable in respect of any land acquired under this Act shall be the market value of such land on the date of publication of the notice under sub-section (1) of Section 4.&quot; Section 8 sets out the matters that are to be ignored in determining the amount under Section 7. Section 9 entitles any person who does not agree with the amount determined by the prescribed authority under Section 7(2) to prefer an appeal to the &#39;Court&#39; within such period as may be prescribed. Sub-section (1) of Section 10 requires the prescribed authority to determine who, in his opinion, are entitled to receive the amount where several persons claim to be interested therein and what is payable to each of them. Sub- section (2) states that where a dispute arises in this behalf the prescribed authority may refer it for the decision of the court and the court must, in deciding such dispute, follow the provisions of Part III of the Land Acquisition Act. Section 11 reads thus: &quot;11. Payment of amount.- (1) After the amount has been determined, the prescribed authority shall tender payment of the amount to the persons entitled thereto and shall pay it to them-\r\n\r\n(i)in a lump sum in a case where it does not exceed two thousand rupees,and\r\n\r\n(ii)in all other cases, in such number of equal annual instalments not exceeding five as may be determined by the prescribed authority and the amount of each such annual instalment shall not be less than two thousand rupees: Provided that where the balance of the amount due in any instalment is less than two thousand rupees, only the actual amount so due shall be paid.\r\n\r\n(2)If the persons entitled to the amount do not consent to receive it or if there be no person competent to alienate the land, or if there be any dispute as to the title to receive the amount, or as to the apportionment of it, the prescribed authority shall deposit the amount in the Court, and the Court shall deal with the amount so deposited in the manner laid down in Sections 32 and 33 of the Land Acquisition &#39;Act, 1894 (Central Act I of 1894).&quot;\r\n\r\nSection 12 provides for payment of interest. It says that when the compensation amount is not paid or deposited on or before taking possession of the land, the prescribed authority shall pay it with interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the time of taking possession until payment. Section 13 reads thus:\r\n\r\n&quot;13. Appeal to High Court.- Subject to the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Central Act V of 1908) applicable to appeals from original decrees, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any enactment for the time being in force, a second appeal shall lie to the High Court from any decision of the Court under this Act, if the amount as determined by the prescribed authority exceeds such sum as may be prescribed.&quot;\r\n\r\nSection 20 states that the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, save as provided in the said Act, shall cease to apply to any land which is required for the purpose specified in Section 4(1) and such land shall be acquired only in accordance with the provisions of the said Act. Section 22 reads thus:\r\n\r\n&quot;22. Application of the Act to certain pending cases of acquisition.- (1) The provisions of this Act shall apply also to any case or cases in which proceedings have been started before the commencement of this Act for the acquisition of any land for the Harijan Welfare Scheme under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (Central Act I of 1894) (hereinafter in this section referred to as the said Act) but no award has been made by the Collector under Section 11 of the said Act before such commencement, as if-\r\n\r\n(i) the notification published under sub- section (1) of Section 4 of the said Act, or\r\n\r\n(ii)the declaration made under Section 6 of the said Act, or\r\n\r\n(iii)the notice given under sub-section (1) of Section 9 of the said Act, were a notice to show cause against the acquisition of the land served under sub- section (2) of Section 4 of this Act. (2)Nothing contained in sub-section (1) shall apply in relation to any land unless and until after&#39; the District Collector has published a notice in the District Gazette to the effect that the said land is required for the purpose specified in sub-section (1) of Section 4 of this Act.&quot;\r\n\r\n5. It was submitted by learned counsel for the respondents that no enquiry as required by Section 5 of the Land Acquisition Act was contemplated by the said Act. Whereas it was the Government which was required to consider objections and the need for acquisition and make a declaration thereafter that the land was required for a public purpose under the Land Acquisition Act, it was, under the said Act, left to the District Collector to be satisfied that the land was required for the purpose of a Harijan Welfare Scheme. No enquiry into the value of the land was contemplated under the said Act inasmuch as a provision equivalent to Section 11 of the Land Acquisition Act was not to be found in the said Act.\r\n\r\nWhereas the Land Acquisition Act set out the matters that were required to be considered for the purposes of award of compensation there was no such provision in the said Act. The said Act did not provide for a reference to the court in regard to a claim for enhancement of compensation in the manner of Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act; it provided only for an appeal to the court and, having regard to the terms of Section 9, that appeal was restricted to the amount of solatium payable under Section 7(2) of the said Act. Section 11 of the said Act provided for the payment of the compensation amount in instalments in the event that the amount thereof exceeded Rs 2000. Section 13 of the said Act provided for a second appeal to the High Court only if the amount as determined by the prescribed authority exceeded such sum as might be prescribed. This sum, it may be mentioned, was at the relevant time Rs.50,000, which was the amount prescribed for the purposes of all second appeals to the High Court under the rules for the purpose.\r\n\r\n6. In State of M.P v. G.C. Mandawar1 a Constitution Bench held that Article 14 does not authorise the striking down of the law of one State on the ground that, in contrast with the law of another State on the same subject, its provisions are discriminatory, nor does it contemplate the law of the Centre or of a State dealing with similar subjects being held to be unconstitutional by a process of comparative study of the provisions of the two. The sources of authority for the two being different, Article 14 can have no application. In Sant Lal Bharti v. State of Punjab2 this was reiterated.\r\n\r\n7. When a statute is impugned under Article 14 what the court has to decide is whether the statute is so arbitrary or unreasonable that it must be struck down. At best, a statute upon a similar subject which derives its authority from another source can be referred to, if its provisions have been held to be reasonable or have stood the test of time, only for the purpose of indicating what may be said to be reasonable in the context. We proceed to examine the provisions of the said Act upon this basis.\r\n\r\n8. Sub-section (1) of Section 4 empowers the District Collector, if he is satisfied that it is necessary to acquire some land for the purpose of a Harijan Welfare Scheme, to acquire that land by publishing in the District Gazette a notice to the effect that he has decided to acquire it in pursuance of Section 4. Sub-section (2) of Section 4 obliges the District Collector or any officer authorised by him in this behalf to call upon the owner or any other person who, in the opinion of the District Collector or the officer so authorised, is interested in such land to show cause why it should not be acquired. Where the District Collector has called upon the owner or other person to show cause under sub-section (2), clause (a) of sub-section (3) requires him to pass orders on the cause so shown. Where an officer authorised by the District Collector has called upon the owner or other person to show cause under sub-section (2), clause (b) of Section 3 requires that officer to report to the District Collector his recommendations on the cause so shown and the 1 (1955) 1 SCR 599 AIR 1954 SC 493 2 (1988) 1 SCC 366 (1988) 2 SCR 107 District Collector is required to pass such orders as he may deem fit after considering the report. Sub-section (2) of Section 4, therefore, obliges the acquiring authority to serve notice upon the landowner and other persons interested in the land to show cause why it should not be acquired. By reason of sub-section (3) of Section 4, such cause has to be taken into account and orders passed in respect thereof. It is only thereafter that the acquiring authority can arrive at the satisfaction that it is necessary to acquire the land. The provisions of Section 4, therefore, substantially encapsulate the provisions of Sections 4 to 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, the only major difference being that, under the said Act, it is the District Collector and not the State Government who must be satisfied that the land is required to be acquired. It does not appear to us that this is a provision whi ch is unreasonable or arbitrary.\r\n\r\n9.By reason of Section 5, the land in respect of which notice under Section 4(1) is published vests absolutely in the State\r\n This appeal by special leave is filed by the State of Tamil Nadu against the judgment and order of the High Court of Madras dated 9-9-1981, where by the Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for Harijan Welfare Schemes Act, 1978, was struck down as being ultra vires the Constitution of India. The High Court came to the conclusion that the said Act did not enjoy the protection of Articles 31-C or 31-A and that it was violative of Articles 14, 19 and 300-A of the Constitution. These civil appeals each party shall bear and pay its own costs.\r\n ','D.B. Madan Vs Commissioner Of Income-Tax JUDGMENT\r\n\r\n1. Heard learned counsel on both sides. Special leave granted.\r\n\r\n2. The High Court declined to call upon the Appellate Tribunal to state a case and refer a question of law said to arise out of the Tribunal&#39;s appellate order for its opinion. The circumstance that, in doing so, the High Court relied on a decision which in turn followed an earlier one in CIT v. T.S. Hajee Moosa and Co. (Mad) implied that a question of law did arise, but the question, in view of the earlier decision, was held as not a referable question of law. It is always open to the High Court to follow its earlier decision and answer the question of law one way or the other according as whether the view taken in the earlier case commends itself to it or whether, in its opinion, that earlier view needs reconsideration. But it cannot always be said that, in all cases where a similar question of law had been answered in an earlier case in a\r\n High Court declined to call upon the Appellate Tribunal to state a case and refer a question of law said to arise out of the Tribunal&#39;s appellate order for its opinion. The circumstance that, in doing so, the High Court relied on a decision which in turn followed an earlier one in CIT v. T.S. Hajee Moosa and Co. (Mad) implied that a question of law did arise, but the question, in view of the earlier decision, was held as not a referable question of law- Facts and circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was justified in holding that the expenditure on the air travel of the assessee&#39;s wife was not incurred wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the business of the assessee and that the benefit derived by the wife would detract from the exclusiveness of the outlay so as to render it ineligible as a deductible expenditure- Appeals are disposed of accordingly.\r\n ','Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd Vs Union Of India & Anr 63 at 69; Council v. Hindustan Co-operative Insurance Society Ltd., 58 I.A. 259, Ramswarup v. Munshi &amp; Ors. [1963] 3 SCR 858; Bolani Ores Ltd. v. State of Orissa, [1975] 2 SCR 138; referred to.\r\n\r\n(c) Section 55 is an instance of legislation by incorporation and not legislation by reference. In enacting s. 55 the legislature did not want to confer an unlimited right of appeal but wanted to restrict it. It found that the grounds set out in the then existing s. 100 CPC were appropriate for restricting the right of appeal and hence incorporated them in s.55. The legislature could never have intended to limit the right of appeal to any ground or grounds which might from time to time find place in s. 100 without knowing what those grounds were. [1063 B-D]\r\n\r\n(d) Secondly, the Act is a self-contained code and it is not possible to believe that the legislature could have made the right of appeal under such a code dependent on the viscititudes of a section in another statute. [1063 F]\r\n\r\n(e) That apart, an indissoluble link between s. 55 and s. 100, CPC would lead to a startling result. If, for example, s. 100 were repealed, s. 55 would be reduced to futility and the right of appeal under the Act would be wholly gone. It would be absurd to place on the language of s. 55 an interpretation which might in a given situation result in denial of the right of appeal altogether and thus defeat the plain object and purpose of the section. [1063 H]\r\n\r\n(f) Even assuming that the right of appeal under s.55 is restricted to the ground specified in the new s. 100 CPC the present appeal would still be maintainable because it involves a substantial question of law relating to the interpretation of s. 13(2) of the Act. [1064 D]\r\n\r\n(g) The test for determining whether a question of law raised in an appeal is a substantial question of law is to see whether it is of general public importance or whether it directly or substantially affects the rights of parties and if so whether it is an open question in the sense that it is not finally settled by this Court or by the Privy Council or by the Federal Court or is not free from difficulty or call for discussion of alternative views. [1064 E] Sir Chunilal V. Mehta &amp; Sons Ltd. v. The Century Spinning and Manufacturing Co. Ltd., [1962] Supp. 3 SCR 549; referred to.\r\n\r\nIn the present case the appeal clearly involves a substantial question of law within the meaning of the Act, because the interpretation of s. 13(2) directly and substantially affects the rights of the parties and is not finally settled by this Court.\r\n\r\n2(a) The words &quot;in the manner in which it was made-&#39; occurring in s. 13(2) have no bearing on the content or the scope and ambit of the power but merely indicate the procedure to be followed by the Commission in amending or revoking an order made by it. [1064 H]\r\n\r\n(b) The power conferred under s. 13(2) is of the widest amplitude and in this respect it is unlike s. 22 of the English Act. This power is intended to ensure that the order passed is and continues to be in conformity with the requirements of the Act, and the trade practice condemned by the order is really and truly a restrictive trade practices and it must therefore, be construed in a wide sense so as to effectuate the object and purpose of the grant of the power. [1065 B]\r\n\r\n(c) The powers under s. 13(2) and s. 55 are distinct and independent powers and one cannot be read as subject to the other. The scope and applicability of s. 13(2) is not cut down by the provision for appeal under s. 55. It is perhaps because the right of appeal given under s. 55 is limited to a question of law that a wide and unfettered power is conferred on the Commission to amend or revoke an order in appropriate cases. [1066 A]\r\n\r\n(d) The conferment of such wide and unusual power under s. 13(2) was necessary to ensure that an erroneous order is capable of being corrected. An order made under s. 37 or under any other provision of the Act may affect not only the parties before the Commission but also others such as the whole net-work of distributors or dealers who were not before the Commission. It may also affect the entire trade in the product. There may be some Facts or circumstances having a crucial bearing on the determination of the enquiry which, if taken into account, may result in a different order being made or some fact or circumstance may arise which may expose the invalidity of the order or render it bad. There may be a material change in the relevant circumstances subsequent to the making of the order. Therefore, by its very nature. the order of the Commission is transient or pro-tempore and must be liable to be altered or revoked according as there is material change in the relevant economic facts and circumstance. [1366 B-E]\r\n\r\n(e) But howsoever large may be the power under s. 13(2), it cannot be construed to be so wide as to permit a rehearing on the same material without anything more with a view to showing that the order was wrong on facts. [1067]\r\n\r\n(f) When Regulation 85 says that the provisions of s. 114 and O. XLVII, r. 1 CPC shall as far as may, be applied to the proceedings under s. 13(2) it cannot be read to mean that an application under s. 13(2) can be maintained only on the grounds set out in s. 114 and O. XLVII r. 1. This regulation does not in any manner limit the width and amplitude of the power under s. 13(2). A good part of it is procedural in nature and has nothing to do with the grounds on which an application under s. 13(2) may be maintained. The words &quot;as far as may&quot; occurring in its last part do not indicate that an application under s. 13(2) can be maintained only on the grounds set out in s. 114 and O. XLVII, r. 1, CPC. All that they indicate is that the provisions of s. 114 and O. XLVII, r. 1 are to be invoked only to the extent applicable, and if in a given case they are not applicable they may be ignored; but that does not mean that the power conferred under s. 13 (2) would not be exercisable in such a case. The reference to the provisions of s. 114 and O. XLVII, r. 1 does not limit the grounds on which an application may be made under s. 13(2). Clearly, therefore, even if a case does not fall within s. 114 and O. XLVII, r. 1, the Commission would have power in an appropriate case to amend or revoke an order made by it in the exercise of its power under s. 13(2). [1067 E-H] 3(a) The power of the Commission under s. 13(2) was exercisable in the present case and the order dated 14th May 1976 was liable to be revoked. [1077 B]\r\n\r\n(b) The submission of the distributorship agreement for registration under s. 33 cannot be construed as admission on the appellant&#39;s part that the clauses in the agreement constituted restrictive trade practices. The appellant had possibly submitted the agreement for registration on the erroneous view (which was also the view of the Commission in the Telco case) that the moment an agreement contains a trade practice falling within any of the clauses of s. 33(1) the trade practice must, irrespective of whether it falls within the definition of s. 2(o) or not, be regarded as a restrictive trade practice and the agreement must be registered. The question whether a particular trade practice is restrictive or not is essentially a question of law based on the application of the definition in s. 2(o) to the facts of a given case and no admission on a question of law can ever be used, in evidence against the make of the admission. Therefore, even assuming that there was an admission in submitting the agreement for registration it could not be used as evidence against the appellant in the enquiry under s. 37. [1075 C-G]\r\n\r\n(c) There was nothing in the conduct of the appellant which would amount to acquiescence or raise an estoppel against it. The appellant did not at any time, accept the impugned order knowing that it was erroneous. There can be no acquiescence without knowledge of the right to repudiate or challenge. [1068 H]\r\n\r\n(d) Neither did the failure of the appellant to prefer an appeal amount to acquiescence on its part because an application under s. 13(2), which is An alternative and a more effective remedy, was available to it. [1069 G]\r\n\r\n(e) The fact that the appellant did not implement the impugned order by entering into revised distributorship agreements with its distributors also showed that there was no acquiescence on its part so far as the order dated 14th May 1976 was concerned. [1070 C]\r\n\r\n(f) Estoppel can arise only if a party to a proceeding had altered his position on the faith of a representation or promise made by another. In the instant case there is nothing to show that the Registrar had altered his position on the basis of the application for extension of time made by the appellant. [1107 D] 4(a). The order of the Commission was bad because it was based on no material and, could not possibly have been made by the Commission. [1076 A-B]\r\n\r\n(b) The definition of restrictive trade practice in the Act is, to some extent, based on the rule of reason evolved by American courts while interpreting a similar provision in the Sherman Act. The rule of reason normally requires ascertainment of facts or features peculiar to the particular business, its condition before and after the restraint was imposed, the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable, the history of the restraint and the evil believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular restraint and the purpose sought to be attained. It is only on a consideration of these factors that it can be decided whether a particular act, contract or agreement imposing the restraint is unduly restrictive of competition so as to constitute restraint of trade. Certain restraint of trade are unreasonable per se because of their pernicious effect on competition and lack of any redeeming virtue; they are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and, therefore, illegal without elaborate enquiry as to the precise harm they have caused or the business execuse for their use. In such cases illegality does not depend on a showing of the unreasonableness of the practice and it is unnecessary to have a trial to show the nature, extent and degree of its market effect. [1074 A, B; 1075 A-B]\r\n\r\n(c) It is now settled law that every trade practice which is in restraint of trade is not necessarily restrictive trade practice. If a trade practice merely regulates and thereby promotes competition it would not fall within the definition even if it is to some extent in restraint of trade. Therefore, the question whether a trade practice is a restrictive trade practice or not has the decided not on any theoretical or a priori reasoning. but by inquirie whether it has or may have the effect of preventing distorting or restricting competition. The peculiar facts and features of the trade would be very much relevant in determining this question. [1072 H]\r\n\r\n(d) In the Telco case this Court laid down that an application by the Registrar under s. 10(a) (iii) must contain facts which in his opinion constitute restrictive trade practice and show or establish as to how the alleged clauses constitute restrictive trade practice in the context of the facts. But even if the application does not set out any facts or features showing how the trade practices complained of by the Registrar are restrictive practices, the Registrar can still, at the hearing of the enquiry, in the absence of any demand for particulars being made by the opposite party produce material before the Commission disclosing facts or features which go to establish the restrictive nature of the trade practice complained of and if that is done, the defect in the application would not be of much consequence. [1070 G-H] In the instant case the burden of producing the necessary material that the impugned trade practices had the actual or probable effect of diminishing or destroying competition and were therefore restrictive trade practices was on the Registrar who made on application before the Commission. No material beyond reproducing the impugned clauses of the agreement and the words of the relevant sections having been produced, the application of the Registrar was contrary to the law laid down by this Court. Therefore, the Commission had no basis for making its order dated 14th May 1976.\r\n\r\n(e) The argument that the trade practices referred to in the offending clauses were per se restrictive trade practices and in any event, even if any supporting material was necessary, it was to be found in the admission of the appellant contained in its letter submitting the distributorship agreement for registration was without any force.\r\n\r\n5(a). When the issue before the court is whether a practice trade practice set out in an agreement has or may have the effect of preventing, distorting or restricting competition so as to constitute a restrictive trade practice, it is the actual or probable effect of the trade practice which has to be judged and there is no question of contradicting, varying, adding to or substracting from the terms of the agreement by admitting extraneous evidence. The various factors stated earlier are required to be taken into account only for the purpose of determining the actual or probable effect of the trade practice referred to in the particular clause. In such a case it is not right to shut out oral evidence to determine the actual or probable effect of the trade practice. [1078 D-E]\r\n\r\n(b) It is not s. 33(1) which invalidates a clause in an agreement relating to a trade practice but it is the restrictive nature of the trade practice as set out in s. 2(o) which makes it void. [1079 E]\r\n\r\n(c) When a question of restrictive trade practice arises in relation to a clause in an agreement it is the trade practice in the clause that has to be examined for determining its actual or probable effect on competition. A clause in an agreement may proprio vigore impose a restraint. Where such restraint produces or is reasonably likely to produce the prohibited statutory effect it would clearly constitute a restrictive trade practice and the clause would be bad. [1108 D-E] Tata Engineering &amp; Locomotive Co. Ltd., Bombay,, v. The Registrar of the Restrictive Trade Agreement New Delhi, [1977] 2 SCR 685, applied.\r\n\r\nObservations in Hindustan Lever Ltd. v. M.R.T.P. [1977] 3 SCR 455; disapproved.\r\n\r\n(d) In a case where a clause in agreement does not by- itself impose any restraint but empowers the manufacturer or supplier to take some action which may be restrictive of competition, the mere possibility of action being taken, which may be restrictive of competition, would not in all cases affect the legality of the clause. What is required to be considered for determining the legality of the clause is whether there is a real probability that the presence of the clause itself would be likely to restrict competition. This is basically a question of market effect and cannot be determined by adopting a doctrainaire approach. Each case would have to be examined on its own facts from a business and commonsense point of view. It cannot, therefore, be said that in every case where the clause is theoretically capable of being so utilised as to unjustifiably restrict competition it would constitute a restrictive trade practice. [1081 E-H] 6(a). The order dated 14th May 1976 was clearly vitiated by an error of law apparent on the face of the record inasmuch as it contained only the final and operative order without giving any reasons in support of it. [1083 E]\r\n\r\n(b) The two conditions precedent before the Commission can pass a cease and desist order are (i) it must be found that the trade practice complained of is a restrictive trade practice and (ii) where such a finding is reached the Commission must be satisfied that none of the &quot;gateways&quot; pleaded in answer to the complaint exists. [1082 D-E]\r\n\r\n(c) In the instant case the appellant did not appear before the Commission and no &#39;gateways&quot; were pleaded and therefore the question of the Commission arriving at a satisfaction in regard to &quot;gateways&quot; did not arise. Nonetheless the Commission was required to be satisfied that the trade practices complained of were restrictive trade practices. The order dated 14th May 1976 did not contain any discussion showing that the Commission had reached the requisite satisfaction. It gave merely bald directions without any reasons. The ex-parte character of the order did not absolve the Commission from the obligation to give reasons in support of the order because the appellant would have been entitled to prefer an appeal even against on ex-parte order and in the absence of reasons, the appellant would not be in a position to attack the order in appeal. It is well established that every quasi-judicial order must be supported by reasons. [1082 E-H] N.M. Desai v. Textiles Ltd., C.A. 245 of 1970, dec. On 17th Dec., 1975; Simons Engineering Co. v.

Datar and Girish Chandra for Respondent No. 2.\r\n\r\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATI, J.-This appeal under section 55 of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) raises interesting questions of law relating to the interpretation and application of certain provisions of the Act. The facts giving rise to the appeal are for the most part undisputed and they may be briefly stated as follows:\r\n\r\nThe appellant is a public limited company engaged in manufacture and sale of jeep motor vehicles and their Spare parts and accessories. Since 1947 the appellant was marketing and distri-\r\n\r\nbuting jeep motor vehicles and it had set up a large and complex net work of dealers, who were described as distributors, for marketing and after sale service of such vehicles. In or about 1956 the appellant started manufacturing its own jeep motor vehicles and since then it has been manufacturing such vehicles and distributing and marketing the same through its net work of distributors. The appellant has appointed these distributors for marketing and sale of jeep motor vehicles on certain terms and conditions contained in a standard distributorship agreement. The material clauses of this agreement read as follows:\r\n\r\n&quot;Section (3): TERRITORY OF DISTRIBUTOR:-` The Company grants to Distributor the non-exclusive privilege (except as hereinafter provided) of selling at re tail and the right (except hereinafter provided) to appoint in writing by forms of agreements approved by the Company, Dealers to sell at retail the products enumerated in Section 2 of this agreement, within the following territory and also demarcated in the map attached hereto and which forms a part of this agreement.\r\n\r\nDistributor accepts the above retail setting privileges and agrees to develop with diligence the sales of sale products in said territory in accordance with this agreement and undertakes to achieve the quantum of sales in the territory as may be fixed by the Company from time to time.\r\n\r\nSection (4): LIMITATIONS ON TERRITORIAL RIGHTS:-\r\n\r\n(i) Distributor agrees not to solicit outside of the territory described in Section 3-the purchase of any products.\r\n\r\n* * * * Section (6): PRICE AND PAYMENT :-Distributor will pay for products the Company&#39;s established Distributor net prices in effect on date on despatch.

V of the Act. The appellant also submitted to the Registrar along with its letter dated 19th May, 1972 four copies of the standard distributorship agreement for registration in terms of cl. (ii) of Rule 12 of the Monopolies Restrictive Trade Practices Rules, 1970 (hereinafter referred to as the Rules) and the standard distributorship agreement was registered by the Registrar under section 35 of the Act.\r\n\r\nOn 17th December, 1975 the Registrar made an application to 11 the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission (hereinafter referred to as the Commission) under section 10(a) (iii) of the Act pointing out to the Commission that the standard distributorship agreement entered into by the appellant with the distributors was filed by the appellant for registration in the office of the Registrar and the same had been duly registered under section 35 of the Act. The Registrar drew the attention of the Commission to clauses (3), (4), (5), (6), (11), (13), (14), (17) and (20) of the standard distributorship agreement and claimed that the provisions contained in these clauses related &quot;to restrictive trade practices relating to imposing restrictions on persons and classes of persons to whom goods are sold and from whom goods are bought tie-up sales/full-line forcing; exclusive dealing; granting or allowing concessions; discounts, over- riding commission, etc. in connection with or by reason of dealings; resale price maintenance; and allocation of area/market for disposal of products covered under the agreement, respectively attracting clauses (a), (b), (c),\r\n\r\n(e), (f) and (g) of section 33(1) and/or section 2(o) of the Act&quot; and that these restrictive trade practices had and might have the effect of preventing, distorting and restricting competition and tended to bring about monopolisation of prices and conditions of delivery and to affect the flow of supplies in the market relating to goods covered under the standard distributorship agreement in such manner as to impose on the consumers unjustified costs and restrictions and the same were prejudicial to public interest. The Registrar prayed on the basis of these allegations that the Commission be pleased to inquire into the restrictive trade practices indulged in by the appellant, under section 37 of the Act and pass such orders as it might deem fit and proper. The Commission, on receipt of this application, decided, in exercise of the powers conferred upon it under sections 10(a) and 37 of the Act, to hold inquiry into the restrictive trade practices complained of by the Registrar and issued notice dated 2nd January, 1976 under Regulation 53 of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission Regulations, 1974 (hereinafter referred to as the Regulations) to the appellant that if the appellant wished to be heard in the proceedings before the Commission, it should comply with the requirements of Regulations 65 and 67 failing which the Commission would proceed with the inquiry in the absence of respondent. The appellant, by its letter dated 3rd February, 1976, acknowledged receipt of the notice and intimated to the Commission that it did not wish to be heard in the proceedings before the Commission but put forward its submissions in regard to the restrictive trade practices alleged by the Registrar in his application. The appellant pointed out that the clauses of the standard distributionship agreement complained of by the Registrar did not constitute restrictive trade practices for the reasons explained in the letter and requested the Deputy Secretary to place their submissions before the Commission at the enquiry to be held by it. The letter was purported to be submitted in terms of Regulations 36(3), but the reference to this Regulation was obviously under some misapprehension because this Regulation occurred in Chapter V which provided the procedure for reference under Chapter III and IV and it had no application in case of an inquiry under section 37 of the Act. The Joint Secretary (Legal) of the Commission pointed out to the appellant by his letter dated 11th February, 1976 that if the appellant wished to be heard in the proceedings, the appellant should comply with the requirements of Regulations 65 and 67 and it is only if the appellant did so, that it could file a reply in answer to the application of the Registrar and moreover, the reply had to be properly drawn and duly verified and declared as provided in those Regulations. The Joint Secretary. (Legal) made it clear that in view of this legal position obtaining under Regulations 65 and 67, it was not possible to take note of contents of the letter addressed by the appellant setting out the explanation for the various clauses impugned in the application of the Registrar. Though this position, in law was specifically pointed out by the Joint Secretary (Legal) on behalf of the Commission, the appellant did not comply with the procedure set out in Regulations 65 and 67 with the result that the Commission decided to proceed exparte against the appellant. The Registrar filed an affidavit of the Assistant Registrar dated 10th May, 1976 in support of the allegations contained in the application but this affidavit surprisingly did not contain any further or other material than that set out in the application. No other evidence, oral or documentary, was produced by the Registrar and the Commission proceeded to decide the issues arising in the enquiry on the basis of the application supported by the affidavit of the Assistant Registrar. The Commission, after going through the application and the affidavit of the Assistant Registrar and hearing the Registrar, made an order dated 14th May, 1976, the operative part of which was in the following terms:\r\n\r\n&quot;(1) The Respondent is hereby restrained and prohibited by any agreement with any distributor to restrict by any method the persons or classes or persons to whom the goods are sold whether such person be retail purchaser or a dealer.\r\n\r\n(2) The Respondent is hereby restrained and prohibited from restricting in any manner, any purchaser whether a dealer or otherwise in the course of its trade from acquir-\r\n\r\ning or otherwise dealing in any goods other than those of the Respondent or the goods of any other person. (3) The Respondent is hereby restrained and prohibited from selling any goods to any distributor, dealer or other wise on the condition that the prices to be charged on resale by the purchaser shall be the prices stipulated by the respondent unless it is clearly stated that prices lower than those prices may be charged. The Respondent is hereby directed that in all future price lists it must state on the cover or on the front page that the prices if any indicated therein as resale prices are maximum prices and that the prices lower than those price may be charged.\r\n\r\n(4) The Respondent is hereby restrained and prohibited from allocating any area or market to any distributor or dealer for the disposal of the Respondent&#39;s goods. (5) The Respondent is hereby restrained and prohibited from preventing any distributor from appointing any dealer of its own choice on such terms and conditions as may be mutually agreed upon between distributors and dealers in cases where the Respondent does not undertake any obligation, liability or responsibility in respect of the dealers.\r\n\r\n(6) The clauses in the agreements relating to the above restrictive trade practices are hereby declared to be void. The practices arising therefore, shall be discontinued and shall not be repeated. (7) The Respondent shall within 3 months from the date of service of this order on it make and file an affidavit before the Commission setting out the manner in which this order has been given effect to. A copy of the said affidavit shall simultaneously be furnished to the Registrar.\r\n\r\n(8) There will be no order as to costs.&quot;\r\n\r\nSince the appellant was required to file an affidavit of compliance within three months as directed by cl. (7) of the Order, the appellant filed an affidavit dated 10th September, 1976 stating that the appellant had fully implemented in practice the directions contained in Paragraphs (1) and (5) of the Order and refrained from enforcing against the distributors any of the clauses which had been declared void by the Commission. The appellant also pointed out that a draft of a new distributorship agreement was being finalised by the appellant with a view to giving effect to the &quot;restrictions and prohibitions&quot; contained in the Order. The Registrar filed an affidavit of the Deputy Registrar dated 27th September, 1976 seeking particulars from the appellant showing how the appellant had implemented the directions contained in the Order. The appellant by its reply dated 11th November, 1976 pointed out that since the date of receipt of the Order, the appellant had not given effect to the trade practices covered by paragraphs (1) to (5) of the Order nor required any of the distributors to abide by the clauses of the standard distributorship agreement relating to those trade practices and on the contrary, intimated to the distributors that the old distributorship agreement would have to be substituted by a new revised agreement. The appellant submitted that since the clauses of the standard distributorship agreement declared void by the Commission were not enforceable in law by the appellant, it did not make any difference whether or not they were deleted from the existing distributorship agreement and in view of the fact that a new revised agreement was being prepared which would comply with the directions contained in the Order, it was not necessary, to effect any amendments in the existing distributorship agreement. It seems that there was a hearing before the Commission on this issue as regards compliance with the directions contained in the Order and the draft of the revised distributorship agreement prepared by the appellant was considered and pursuant to the suggestion made by the Commission, the appellant agreed to amend two clauses in the draft and the Commission by its Order dated 7th December, 1976 directed that the revised distributorship agreement should be filed by the appellant by 31st March, 1977.\r\n\r\nNow, it appears that subsequent to the Order of the Commission dated 7th December, 1976 an important decision was given by this Court in Tata Engineering &amp; Locomotive Co. Ltd., Bombay v. The Registrar of the Restrictive Trade Agreement, New Delhi(&#39;) relating to the interpretation of some of the relevant provisions of the Act bearing on restrictive trade practices. This decision was given in all appeal preferred by Tata Engineering Locomotive Co. Ltd. (herein- after referred to as the Telco against an order made by the Commission in an enquiry under section 37 and it reversed the view taken by the Commission in several important respects. Though this decision was given on 21st January, 1977, it was not fully reported until March 1977 and on reading it, the appellant felt that the order of the Commission dated 14th May, 1976 required reconsideration, as it was contrary to the law laid down in this decision. The appellant accordingly made an application to the Commission on 31st March. 1977 where, besides asking for extension of time for filing a copy of the revised distributorship agreement on the ground that the dealers were spread out all over India and it would take considerable time for execution of the revised distributorship agreement by them, the appellant pointed out that it had not contested the enquiry proceedings under section 37 in the first instance because the decision given by the Commission in the Telco case was directly applicable, but since that decision of the Commission was reversed by this Court in appeal, the appellant was advised to move a suitable application for amendment and/or modification of the Order dated 14th May, 1976 and that was also an additional reason why the time for filing the revised distributorship agreement should be extended, so that the revised distributorship agreement could be in accordance with the directions, if any. which might be given by the Commission on the proposed application. The Commission acceded to the request contained in this application and extended the time for filing the revised distributorship agreement upto 4th June, 1977.\r\n\r\nThe appellant thereafter made an application dated 30th May, 1977 under section 13(2) of the Act read with Regulation 85 for revocation, amendment or modification of the Order of the Commission dated 14th May, 1976. The appellant set out in this application various facts and features relating to its trade of manufacture and sale of Jeep motor vehicles and their spare parts and accessories and enumerated a number of grounds on which the order of the Commission dated 14th May, 1976 deserved to be revised, revoked, amended or otherwise modified. The application was opposed by the Registrar by filing a reply dated. 17th August, 1977. The parties were thereafter heard by the Commission on 26th August, 1977 and pursuant to the directions given by the Commission. affidavits of documents were filed and evidence was recorded on both sides. It appears that in the course of the evidence the appellant came to know that in November 1977 Hindustan Motors Ltd. had introduced in the 6 market diesel trekker which was clearly a competing vehicle and the appellant thereupon applied to the Commission on 30th January. 1978 for amendment of the application by adding a plea that the fact that since November 1977 Hindustan Motor Ltd. had started manufacturing and selling diesel trekker which was a highly competitive product was another material change in the relevant circumstances which justified the revocation, amendment or modification of the Order dated 14th May, 1976. This application for amendment was opposed by the Registrar on the ground that it was made at a very late stage of the proceeding. The Commission did not pass any order on this application for amendment and kept it pending and proceeded to dispose of the main application by an Order dated 28th February, 1978 by which it rejected the main application with costs and added a short order On the same day stating that in view of the order on the main application, there would be no order on the application for amendment. The appellant thereupon preferred the present appeal in this Court under section 55 challenging the validity of the order made by the Commission rejecting the application of the appellant.\r\n\r\nBefore we set out the rival contentions of the parties in the appeal, it would be convenient at this state to refer to the relevant provisions of the Act and the Regulations. Section 2 is the definition section and clause (u) of this section defines &#39;trade practice&#39; to mean &quot;any practice relating to the carrying on of any trade, and includes-(i) anything done by any person which controls or affects the price charged by, or the method of trading of, any trader or any class of traders (ii) a single or isolated action of any person in relation to any trade&quot;. &#39;Restrictive trade practice&#39; is defiled in section 2, clause (o) to mean &quot;a grade practice which has, or may have, the effect of preventing distorting or restricting, competition in any manner and in particular,-(i) which tends to obstruct the flow of capital or resources into the stream of production, or (ii) which tends to bring about manipulation of prices, or conditions of delivery or to affect the flow of supplies in. the market relating to goods or services in such manner as to impose on the consumers unjustified costs or restrictions.&quot; Section 5, subsection (1) provides for the establishment of the Commission which is to consist of a Chairman and not less than two and not more than eight other members to be appointed by the Central Government and sub- section (2) of section 5 lays down that the Chairman shall be a person who is or has been or is qualified to be a judge of the Supreme Court or of a High Court. It is obvious from these two sub-sections of section 5 that the Legislature clearly contemplated that the Commission must have a Chairman who would provide the judicial element and there must be at least two other members who would provide expertise in subjects like economics, law, commerce. accountancy, industry, public affairs or administration. so that there could be a really high-powered expert commission competent and adequate to deal with the various problems which come before it. It, however, appears that the Central Government paid scant regard to this` legislative requirement and though the office of Chairman fell vacant as far back as 9th August, 1976, it failed to make appointment of Chairman until 24th February, 1978. Of the two other members of the Commission one had already resigned earlier and his vacancy was also not filled with the result that the Commission continued with only one member for a period of about 18 months. This was a most unfortunate state of affairs, for it betrayed total lack of concern for the proper constitution and functioning of the Commission and complete neglect of its statutory obligation by the Central Government. We fail to see any reason why the Central Government could not make the necessary appointments and properly constitute the Commission in accordance with the requirements of the Act. It is difficult to believe that legal and judicial talent in the country had become so impoverished that the Central Government could not find a suitable person to fill the vacancy of Chairman for a year and a half. Moreover it must be remembered that the appointments, after all, have to be made from whatever legal and judicial talent is available and the situation is not going to improve by waiting for a year or two: a new star is not going to appear in the legal firmament within such a short time and the appointments cannot be held up indefinitely. Indeed, it is highly undesirable that important quasi-judicial or administrative posts should remain vacant for long periods of time, because apart from impairing the efficiency of the functioning of the statutory authority of the administration. inexplicable delay may shake the confidence of the public in the integrity of the appointments when made. Turning back to the provisions of the Act, we find that section 10(a) (iii) empowers the Commission to inquire into any restrictive trade practice upon an application made to it by the Registrar. The powers of the Commission while holding an enquiry under the Act are enumerated in section 12 and section 13, sub-section (2) provides that &quot;any order made by the Commission may be amended or revoked at any time in the manner in which it was made&quot;. Then follow sections 14 to 19 which deal inter alia with the procedure to be followed by the Commission. We are not concerned with Sections 20 to 32 which occur in Chapters III and IV because they deal with topics other than restrictive trade practices. Chapter V relates to registration of agreements relating to restrictive trade practices and it consists of sections 33 to 36 of which only sections 33 and 35 are material. Sub- section (1) of section 33 provides that any agreement relating to a restrictive trade practice falling within one or more of the categories specified there shall be subject to registration in accordance with the provisions of Ch. V and proceeds to enumerate the categories of restrictive trade practices covered by that provision and section 35 lays down the time within which an agreement falling within section 33, sub-section (1) shall be registered and the procedure to be followed for effectuating such registration. Sections 37 and 38 are the next important sections and they occur in Ch. V headed A &quot;control of certain restrictive trade practices&quot;. Sub-section (1) of section 37 provides that &quot;the Commission may inquire into any restrictive trade practice, whether the agreement, if any, relating thereto has been registered under section 35 or not, which may come before it for inquiry and, if after such inquiry it is of opinion that the practice is prejudicial to the public interest, the Commission may, by order, direct that-(a) the practice shall be discontinued or shall not be repeated, (b) the agreement relating there to shall be void in respect of such restrictive trade practice or shall stand modified in respect thereof in such manner as may be specified in the order&quot;. Section 38, sub-section (1) enacts that for the purposes of any proceedings before the Commission under section 37, a restrictive trade practice shall be deemed to be prejudicial to the public interest unless the Commission is satisfied of any one or more of the circumstances set out in that subsection and is further satisfied, after balancing the competing considerations, that the restriction is not unreasonable. These circumstances specified in sub-section (1) of section 38 render a trade practice permissible even though it is restrictive and provide what have been picturesquely described in the English law as &quot;gateways&quot; out of the prohibition of restrictive trade practices. Section 55 is the next relevant section and it provides that any person aggrieved by any order made by the Central Government under Ch. III or Ch. IV or as the case may be, of the Commission under section 13 or section 37 may, within 60 days from the date of the order, prefer an appeal to the Supreme Court on &quot;one or more of the grounds specified in section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908&quot;. This is the section under which the present appeal has been preferred by the appellant. The last section to which we must refer is section 66 which confers power on the Commission to make Regulations for the efficient performance of its functions under the Act. The Commission has, in exercise of the power conferred by this section, made the Regulations of which three arc material. namely, Regulations 65, 67 and 85. These Regulations, in so far as material, read as follows &quot;Section 65: APPEARANCE OF PARTIES : Every respondent who wishes to be heard in the proceedings shall within 14 days of the service upon him of the copy of the notice of enquiry, enter an appearance in the office of the Commission by delivering to the Secretary six copies of a memorandum stating that the respondent wishes to be heard in the proceedings and containing the name of his advocate having an office in Delhi or New Delhi and duly authorised to accept service of processes and the Secretary shall send one copy of the memorandum to the Registrar in case where proceedings are initiated under sub- clause (iii) of clause (a) of section 10, and in all other cases to the Director of Investigation.&quot; &quot;Section 67: REPLY TO THE NOTICE: Every respondent who has entered an appearance shall within four weeks of his entering appearance deliver to the Secretary a reply to the notice (5 copies) which shall include:-\r\n\r\n(a) particulars of each of the provisions of section 38 of Act on which he intends to rely; and\r\n\r\n(b) particulars of the facts and matters alleged by him to entitle him to rely on such provisions.&quot; &quot;Section 85: AMENDMENT OR REVOCATION OF ORDER ETC.: An application under sub-section (2) of section 13 of the Act for amendment-or revocation of any order made by the Commission in any proceedings shall be supported by evidence on affidavit of the material change in the relevant circumstances or any other fact or circumstances on which the applicant relies. Unless the Commission otherwise directs notice of the application together with copies of the affidavits in support thereof, shall be served on every party who appeared at the hearing of the previous proceedings and every such party shall be entitled to be heard on the application and the provisions of section 114 and Order XLVII of the Code of Civil Procedure, &#39;908 (5 of 1908), shall as far as may, be applied to these proceedings.&quot; It is against the background of these provisions of the Act and the Regulations that we have to determine the question arising for consideration in the appeal.\r\n\r\nThe contention of the appellant in support of the appeal was that the Order dated 14th May, 1976 suffered from various infirmities and was liable to be revoked or in any event modified under section 13(2) of the Act. It was said that the application of the Registrar on which the Order dated 14th May, 1976 was made did not set out any facts or features showing how the trade practices referred to in the application were restrictive of competition so as to constitute restrictive trade practices and merely contained a bald recital of the impugned clause and mechanical reproduction of the language of the relevant sections without anything more. The application of the Registrar was thus not in accordance with the law laid down in the decision of this Court in the Telco case and no order could be made upon it by the Commission. It was also urged that there was no material placed before the Commission by the Registrar on the basis of which the Commission could possibly come to the conclusion that the trade practices referred to in the application were restrictive trade practices. Even if the Commission was justified in proceeding exparte against the appellant, the highest that could be assumed in favour of the Registrar was that the facts set out in the application and the supporting affidavit of the Assistant Registrar would be deemed to be admitted, but, apart from the impugned clauses, no other facts were set out either in the application or in the affidavit of the Assistant Registrar and there was accordingly no evidence on which the order dated 14th May, 1976 could be made by the Commission. It was also contended that the Order dated 14th May, 1976 did not set out any facts peculiar to the trade of the appellant or the conditions before and after the imposition of the restraint or the actual or probable effect of the restraint nor did it indicate as to how the trade practices referred to in the impugned clauses constituted restrictive trade practices; it was a non-speaking order which did not give any reasons at all for holding that the trade practices complained of were restrictive trade practices and hence it was vitiated by a legal infirmity. The appellant further urged that the Order dated 14th May, 1976 was a continuing order as it required the appellant not merely to cease but also to desist from the restrictive trade practices set out in the order and it was, therefore, required to be continually justifiable and since the facts and features of the trade set out in the application of the appellant clearly established that the trade practices referred to in the impugned clauses did not constitute restrictive trade practices, the Order dated 14th May, 1976 was not justified and in any event could not be continued and it was accordingly liable to be revoked or amended under section 13(2). It was submitted that in any event the Order dated 14th May, l 976 was contrary to the law declared by this Court in the Telco case and since the decision in the Telco case was a fact or circumstance subsequent to the making of the Order, it justified the invocation of the power under section 13(2) for revoking or modifying the Order. Lastly, it was contended that in any view of the matter there was a material change in the relevant circumstances subsequent to the making of the Order dated 14th May, 1976 in that Hindustan Motor Ltd. started manufacturing and marketing competing utility vehicles since June 1976 and this was sufficient to warrant reconsideration of the Order under section 13 (2) . The respondents raised a preliminary objection against the maintainability of the appeal on the ground that under section 55 read with the newly substituted section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, an appeal could lie to this Court only on a substantial question of law and since the contentions raised on behalf of the appellant did not raise any substantial question of law, the appeal was not maintainable. The respondents also urged that on a proper construction of section 13(2) read with Regulation 85, the Commission could revoke or amend the Order dated 14th May, 1976 only if there was a material change in the relevant circumstances since the making of the Order or any of the grounds specified in Order XLVlI rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 was available to the appellant. The second and third grounds specified in Order XLVII, rule 1 obviously did not exist in the present case and the claim of the appellant for exercise of the power under section 13(2) could, if at all, rest only on the first ground, namely error of law apparent on the face of the record. But, said the respondents, there was no error of law apparent on the face of the record so far as the Order dated 14th May, 1976 was concerned, nor was there any material change in the relevant circumstances subsequent to the making of the order and hence section 13(2) was not attracted. The respondents contended that what the appellant was seeking to achieve by the application under section 13(2) was reconsideration of the Order dated 14th May, 1976 which was clearly impermissible, since section 13(2) could not be used as a substitute, for section 55 and that too, without the restrictive condition of that section. It was also urged on behalf of the respondents that, in any event the appellant was precluded from challenging the Order dated 14th May, 1976 by an application under Section 13(2) by reason of its subsequent conduct in acquiescing in the Order and unconditionally accepting the same. The appellant clearly waived the defects or infirmities if any in the Order dated 14th May, 1976 and was precluded from raising any contention against the validity of that Order. The respondents disputed validity of the contentions raised on behalf of the appellant and urged that in any event even if any of these defects or infirmities were present, they did not render the Order void as being without jurisdiction and hence the validity of the Order could not be challenged in the collateral proceedings under section 13(2). The respondents also contended that in any view of the matter the Order dated 14th May, 1976 was justified inasmuch as the trade practices complained of by the Registrar were restrictive trade practices. These were the rival contentions urged on behalf of the parties and we shall now proceed to examine The first question that arises for consideration in the preliminary objection of the respondents is as to what is the true scope and admit of an appeal under section 55. That section provides inter alia that any person aggrieved by an order made by the Commission under section 13 may prefer an appeal to this Court on &quot;one or more of the grounds specified in section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908&quot;. Now at the date when section 55 was enacted, namely, 27th December, 1969, being the date of coming into force of the Act, section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure specified three grounds on which a second appeal could be brought to the High Court and one of these grounds was that the decision appealed against was contrary to law. It was sufficient under section 100 as it stood then that there should be a question of law in order to attract the jurisdiction of the High Court in second appeal and, therefore, if the reference in section 55 were to the grounds set out in the then existing section 100, there can be no doubt that an appeal would lie to this Court under section 55 on a question of law. But subsequent to the enactment of section 55 section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure was substituted by a new section by section 37 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1976 with effect from 1st February, 1977 and the new section 100 provided that a second appeal shall lie to the High Court only if the High Court is satisfied that the case involves a substantial question of law. The three grounds on which a second appeal could lie under the former section 100 were abrogated and in their place only one ground was substituted which was a highly stringent ground, namely, that there should be a substantial question of law. This was the new section 100 which was in force on the date when the present appeal was preferred by the appellant and the argument of the respondents was that the maintainability of the appeal was, therefore, required to be judged by reference to the ground specified in the new section 100 and the appeal could be entertained only if there was a substantial question of law. The respondents leaned heavily on section 8(1) of the General Clauses Act, 1897 which provides:\r\n\r\n&quot;8(1) Where this Act, or any Central Act or Regulation made after the commencement of this Act, repeals and re-enacts, with or without modification, any provision of a former enactment, then references in any other enactment or in any instrument to the provision so repealed shall, un-\r\n\r\nless a different intention appears, be construed as references to the provision so re-enacted.&quot;\r\n\r\nand contended that the substitution of the new section 100 amounted to repeal and re-enactment of the former section 100 and, therefore, on an application of the rule of interpretation enacted in section 8(1), the reference in section 55 to section 100 must be construed as reference to the new section 100 and the appeal could be maintained only on the ground specified in the new section 100, that is, on a substantial question of law. We do not think this contention is well founded. It ignores the distinction between a mere reference to or citation of one statute in another and an incorporation which in effect means bodily lefting a provision of one enactment and making it a part of another. Where there is mere reference to or citation of one enactment in another without incorporation, section 8(1) applies and the repeal and re-enactment of the provision referred to or cited has the effect set out in that section and the reference to the provision repealed is required to be construed as reference to the provision as re-enacted. Such was the case in the Collector of Customs, Madras v. Nathella Sampathu Chetty &amp; Anr. and the New Central Jute Mills Co. Ltd. v. The Assistant Collector of Central Excise, Allahabad &amp; Ors. But where a provision of one statute is incorporated in another, the repeal or amendment of the former does not affect the latter. The effect of incorporation is as if the provision were written out in the incorporating statute and were a part of it. Legislation by incorporation is a common legislative device employed by the legislature, where the legislature for convenience of drafting incorporates provisions from an existing statute by reference to that statute instead of setting out for itself at length the provisions which it desires to adopt. Once the incorporation is made, the provision incorporated becomes an integral part of the statute in which it is transposed and thereafter there is no need to refer to the statute from which the incorporation is made and any subsequent amendment made in it has no effect on the incorporating statute. Lord Esher, M.R., while dealing with legislation in incorporation in In re. Wood&#39;s Estate (1886) 31 Ch.D. 607 pointed out at page 615:\r\n\r\n&quot;If a subsequent Act brings into itself by reference some of the clauses of a former Act, the legal effect of that, as has often been held, is to write those sections into the new Act.\r\n\r\njust as if they had been actually written in it with the pen, or printed in it, and, the moment you have those clauses in the later Act, you have no occasion to refer to the former Act at all.&quot;\r\n\r\nLord Justice Brett, also observed to the same effect in Clark v. Bradlaugh (1881) 8 Q.B.D. 63 at 69 :\r\n\r\n&quot; there is a rule of construction that, where a statute is incorporated by reference into a second statute, the repeal of the first statute by a third statute does no affect the second.&quot;\r\n\r\nThis was the rule applied by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Secretary of State for India in Council v. Hindustan Cooperative Insurance Society Ltd. The Judicial Committee pointed out in this case that the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 having been incorporated in the Calcutta Improvement Trust Act, 1911 and become an integral part of it, the subsequent amendment of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 by the addition of sub-section (2) in section 26 had no effect on the Calcutta Land Improvement Trust Act, 1911 and could not be read into it. Sir George Lowndes delivering the opinion of the Judicial Committee observed at page 267 :\r\n\r\n&quot;In this country it is accepted that where a statute is incorporated by reference into a second statute, the repeal of the first statute does not affect the second: see the cases collected in Craies on Statute Law, 3rd edn. pp. 349, 350.\r\n\r\n\r\n	  x		x	      x		     x\r\n	      x	   x   x    The independent existence of the\r\n\r\n\r\ntwo Acts is, therefore, recognized; despite the death of the parent Act, its offspring survives in the incorporating Act. x x x It seems to be no less logical to hold that where certain provisions from an existing Act have been incorporated into a subsequent Act, no addition to the former Act, which is not expressly made applicable to the subsequent Act, can be deemed to be incorporated in it, at all events if it is possible for the subsequent Act to function effectually without the addition.&quot;\r\n\r\nSo also in Ramswarup v. Munshi &amp; Ors., it was held by this Court that since the definition of &quot;agricultural land&#39; in the Punjab Alienation of Land Act, 1900 was bodily incorporated in the Punjab Pre-emption Act, 1913, the repeal of the former Act had no effect on the continued operation of the latter. Rajagopala Ayyangar, J., speaking for the Court observed at pages 868- 869 of the Report:\r\n\r\n&quot;Where the provisions of an Act are incorporated by reference in a later Act the repeal of the earlier Act has, in general, no effect upon the construction or effect of the Act in which its provisions have been incorporated.\r\n\r\nx x x x In the circumstances, therefore, the repeal of the Punjab Alienation of Land Act of 1900 has no effect on the continued operation of the Pre-emption Act and the expression &#39;agricultural land&#39; in the latter Act has to be read as if the definition in the Alienation of Land Act had been bodily transposed into it.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe decision of this Court in Bolani Ores Ltd. v. State of Orissa also proceeded on the same principle. There the question arose in regard to the\r\n Area 10(a) (iii) of the Monopolies and Restrictive Exchange Practices Act, 1969 empowers the Monopolies and Prohibitive Trade Practices Commission to enquire into any prohibitive exchange hones upon an application made to it by the Registrar of Restrictive Trade Agreements. Segment 13(2) gives that &quot;any request made by the Commission might be revised or repudiated whenever in the way in which it was made.&quot; Section 55 gives that any individual distressed by an arrange made by the Central Government or the Commission under s. 13 or s. 37 may incline toward an interest to the Supreme Court on one or more of the grounds determined in s. 100, Code of Common Procedure, 1908. On the date on which the Act came into drive s. 100 C.P.C. indicated three grounds on which a moment bid could mislead the High Court one of them being that the choice claimed against was opposite to law. By an correction made in 1976 s.100 was substituted by a new segment which gives that a moment bid should deceive the High Court just if the High Court is fulfilled that the case includes a considerable question of law. The appealing party, who was a producer of jeep engine vehicles, their save parts and embellishments, submitted for enrollment to the Registrar of Restrictive Trade Understandings, standard distributorship assentions went into by it with its merchants. After registering the understandings, in his application to the Commission, the Enlistment center charged that certain conditions in the assention identified with prohibitive exchange rehearses and that some of them were biased to open intrigue. The litigant, in answer to the Commission&#39;s notice, expressed that it didn&#39;t wish to be heard in the procedures prior to the Commission, bringing up while there was nothing in the decried provisions of the understanding which could be said to constitute prohibitive exchange hones the reasons whereof had as of now been clarified in its answer. 1039 The Registrar documented before the Commission a testimony in support of his application yet that too did not contain any further or extra material than what was set out in his application. No other confirmation, oral or narrative, was delivered by him before the Commission in support of the affirmation that the agreement constituted a prohibitive exchange rehearse. By its request dated May 14, 1976 the Commission pronounced certain provisions of the litigant&#39;s distributorship assention to be void. While correspondence was going on between the Enlistment center and the litigant on the accommodation of a changed distributorship understanding, this Court in Tata Engineering and Train Co. Ltd. v. Enlistment center of Restrictive Trade Rehearses, [1977] 2 SCR 685 gave its understanding on the pertinent arrangements of the Act. Immediately the appealing party made an application to the Commission calling attention to that it did not challenge the enquiry procedures under s. 37 in the first occasion in light of the fact that the Commission&#39;s choice in the Telco case was specifically pertinent; yet now that that choice had been turned around by the Supreme Court in request, its request dated May 14, 1976 required correction/change. An application under s. 13 (2) read with control 85 was in like manner made for denial, correction or modification of the Commission&#39;s request of May 14, 1976. The Commission rejected this application by a request dated 28th February 1978. In its allure under s. 55 of the Act impugning the Commission&#39;s request dated 28th February 1978 the appealing party battled that (1) the Registrar&#39;s application claiming prohibitive exchange hones did not set out any actualities demonstrating how the litigant&#39;s exchange practices were prohibitive in nature and that the Registrar&#39;s application not having been made as per the law set around this Court in Telco case the denounced arrange of the Commission was subject to be denied or adjusted under s. 13(2); (2) the request did not give any purposes behind its choice as was vitiated; and (3) the order was a proceeding with request in light of the fact that it required the appealing party not merely to stop but also cease from the prohibitive exchange rehearses set out in the arrange and was, in this way required to be persistently reasonable and since it was, in opposition to the law set down in Telco case it was at risk to be repudiated or revised; in any occasion the choice of this Court being ensuing to the making of the Commission&#39;s order, there was sufficient legitimization for repudiating or modifying the request under s. 13(2) of the Act. The respondent, then again, battled that (1) on a use of the control of understanding authorized in s. 8(1) or the General Clauses Act, reference in s. 55 to s. 100 C.P.C. must be understood as a kind of perspective to the new s. 100, C.P.C. thus understood an interest to the Supreme Court would lie just if the case included &quot;a considerable question of law&quot; and not generally and since for this situation no such question was included, the interest was not viable; (2) s. 13(2) couldn&#39;t be utilized by the litigant as a substitute for s. 55; and (3) by reason of its consequent lead in assenting in the Commission&#39;s request and genuinely tolerating it, the litigant was blocked from raising any dispute against its legitimacy in offer to this Court. Permitting the interest, ^ HELD: The appeal is viable under s. 55 of the Act. [1064 C] 1(a) On a legitimate understanding of s. 55 it must be held that the grounds speci- 1040 fied in the then existing s. 100 CPC were joined in s. 55 and the substitution of the new s. 100 did not influence or confine the grounds as joined in s. 55. In any occasion, the present interest brings up generous issues of law, and so is viable. [1064 C] (b) There is a refinement between a unimportant reference to then again reference of one statute in another and a consolidation. Where there is a minor reference to or reference of one establishment in another without consolidation, s. 8(1) of the General Clause Act applies and the annulment and re-order of the arrangement alluded to or refered to has the impact set out in that area and the reference to the arrangement canceled is required to be interpreted as reference to the arrangement as re-established. In any case, where a provision of one statute is consolidated in another, the annulment or revision of the former does not influence the last mentioned. The effect of consolidation is as though the arrangement incorporated were worked out in the incorporting statute and were a piece of it. Once the consolidation is made, the arrangement joined turns into an indispensable part of the statute in which it is transposed and thereafter there is no compelling reason to allude to the statute from which the consolidation is made and any resulting change made in it has no impact on the consolidating statute.

','Shamkant Narayan Despande Vs Maharashtra Industrial CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Special Leave petition (c) No.\n4748 of 1991.\nFrom the Judgment and Order dated 21.1.91 of the Bombay High\nCourt in W.P. No. 3481 of 1990.\nN.B. Shetye,  P.M.  Pradhan  and  A.M.	khanwilkar  for	 the\npetitioner.\nDushyant Dave, Beliram Vakil, Abrar Ali, Ajit Yogi, Gajender\nLal, Mukul Gupta and Ms. Sonia Khan for the Respondents.\nThe Judgment of the court was delivered by\n     SAWANT,  J.   The	petitioner  is	diploma-  holder  in\nEngineering  and holds the post of Executive Engineer in the\nrespondent-Corporation. Till 1974, the promotion post of the\nsuperintending Engineer	 was  available	 both  for  diploma-\nholders and degree-holders according to merit-cum-seniority.\nThis was  so according	to  the	 practice  followed  by	 the\nCorporation without  making any	 rules or regulation in that\nbehalf. In  1974, the corporation made regulation by passing\na resolution  by passing a resolution and continued the same\npractice. Admittedly,  the regulation  were not	 made  under\nsection 64  of the  Maharashtra Industrial  Development Act,\n1961 [hereinafter  referred to as the &apos;Act&apos;] under which the\nrespondent-corporation was  created. Thereafter in 1988, the\ncorporation passed a resolution, for the first time,. making\n75 per	cent of	   the	posts  of  superintending  engineers\navailable to  the executive Engineers holding degrees and 25\nper cent  to  the  Executive  Engineers	 who  were  diploma-\nholders.  This	 resolution  was   also	 admittedly   not  a\nregulation made	 under the   said  section 64.	But for this\nresolution, the	 petitioner who was senior to respondent NO.\n2 would	 have been  promoted to	 the post  of Superintending\nEngineer on  31st October,  1990. However,  since respondent\nNo.2 was a degree holder, he got the said resolution and was\npromoted to the said post on that date. It is this promotion\nwhich was challenged by the petitioner by a writ petition in\nthe High  Court. The  High Court  by the  impugned  judgment\ndismissed the said petition.\n     2.	 Two   contentions  were  raised\n     before us.\n     (i) that no classification could be\n     made among	 the Executive Engineers\n     on the  basis of  their educational\n     qualification for	the  purpose  of\n     promotion	 to    the    post    of\n     superintending Engineer, since they\n     belong  to	  the  same   cadre   of\n     Executive Engineers and do the same\n     work.  There   was	 also  a  common\n     seniority	  of	the    Executive\n     Engineers	maintained.   hence  the\n     classification  was  discriminatory\n     in nature and violative of Articles\n     14 and 16 of the Constitution .\n     (ii)  that	  if  at   all	such   a\n     discrimination was	 permissible, it\n     could be  made only  be a statutory\n     rule  or  regulation  framed  under\n     Section 64	 of the said Act. A mere\n     resolution	   or	 an    executive\n     instruction could	not effect  such\n     discrimination.\n3.   We find  not merit in either of the two contentions. It\nis now	well settled  that for	the purpose  of promotion, a\nvalid classification  can made among the members holding the\nsame post  on the  basis of their qualification. In state of\nJummu &amp;	 Kashmir v.  Triloki Nath Khosa &amp; Ors., [1974] 1 SCR\n771, a Constitution Bench of his court has clearly held that\nsuch a	classification is  permissible and  does not violate\nArticles 14  and  16  of  the  Constitution  the  Court	 has\nobserved there that in state of Mysore &amp; Anr. v. P. Narasing\nRao, [1968]  1 SCR  407 and The Union of India and others v.\nDr.(Mrs.) S.B.	Kholi, AIR  1973 SC 811, it was already held\nthat   classification	 on   the   basis   of	 educational\nqualification was  permissible. The  Court then	 referred to\nRoshan Lal  Tandon v.  Union of India, [1968] 1 SCR  185 and\ndistinguished it  on the facts by pointing out that it was a\ncase of	 the direct  recruits and  promotees integrated into\none cadre.  Once they  were integrated they lost their birth\nbirth-marks, viz.  the different   sources  from which	they\nwere recruited.	 [Emphasis supplied].  The court pointed out\nthat Roshan Lal&apos;s case [supra] was thus no authority for the\nproposition that  if direct  recruits  and    promotees	 are\nintegrated into	 one class  they cannot	 be  classified	 for\npurposed of promotion on a basis other than that in the case\nbefore the them the classified for purpose of promotion on a\nbasis  other  than  that  they	were  drawn  from  different\nsources. The  court also  pointed out  that the	 very  Bench\nwhich decided  Roshan Lal&apos;s    case  [supra]  he Constitution of India, Art.14, Art.16 - Promotion to post of Superintending Engineer - Classification of degree-holder and confirmation holder Executive Engineers - Not violative Arts. 14 and 16. \r\n\r\nMaharashtra Industrial Development Act (3 of 1962), S.64. \r\n\r\nAIR 1983 SC 881, Held per incuriam. \r\n\r\nAIR 1974 SC 1, Foll. \r\n\r\nAdvancement - Classification among same class on premise of capabilities - Permissible. \r\n\r\nMaharashtra Industrial Development Act (3 of 1962), S.63 - Promotion to post of Superintending Engineer - Classification of degree holder and confirmation holder Executive Engineers - Made by Corporation by passing simple determination - Not illicit. \r\n\r\nAuthoritative law - Change in administration condition by passing simple determination - allowable. \r\n\r\nStates of Service - Can be changed by official guidelines.\r\n\r\nheld: The proposition that in the absence of the rules and regulations, the authority can act by executive instruction finds direct support in Mysore state Road Transport Corporation v.

After \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe aforesaid judgment, on 25.03.1978, a notice was served on \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe respondents by the PHED stating that it wanted to get the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nland   back   from   the   respondents   which   had   been   restored   to \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem for its own use and order dated 23.04.1969 was sought \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto   be   recalled.     It   was   also   stated   that   the   respondents   are \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nliable   to   be   evicted   from   the   land   in   question.     The \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nrespondents filed objections against the notice for recalling the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norder dated 23.04.1969.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(e)    Since the notice for recalling the order dated 23.04.1969 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas not been formally dropped, the respondents filed a suit in \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   Court   of   Munsif   and   Judicial   Magistrate,   Jodhpur   City, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJodhpur.   The Munsif Magistrate, by order dated 30.06.1982, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndecreed   the   suit   restraining   the   State   Government   from \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmaking   any   alterations   in   the   contract   that   has   come   into \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexistence in pursuance of the order dated 23.04.1969.  Notices \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere   sent   to   the   respondents   to   appear   before   the   Revenue \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister   as   the   Revision   Petition   for   cancellation   of   the   plot \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngranted in the year 1969 was pending before him.  The parties \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappeared   before   the   Revenue   Minister.     By   order   dated \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15.12.1992,   the   Revenue   Minister   cancelled   the   order   dated \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23.04.1969. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(f)    Challenging   the   order   of   the   Revenue   Minister,   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrespondents   filed   a   petition   being   W.P.   No.   1526   of   1993 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbefore  the  High  Court.     The  learned  single  Judge  of the  High \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCourt, by order dated 19.03.2002, allowed the same.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n(g)    Against   the   said   judgment,   the   State   filed   D.B.   Civil \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial Appeal (W) No. 270 of 2002 and the respondents also \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfiled   cross   objections   before   the   High   Court.     The   Division \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBench   of   the   High   Court,   by   impugned   judgment   dated \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14.10.2003,   dismissed   the   appeal   filed   by   the   State   and \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nallowed the cross objection filed by the respondents herein.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(h)    Aggrieved   by   the   said   order   of   the   Division   Bench,   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nState Government filed these appeals before this Court by way \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof special leave petitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(3)    Heard   Dr.   Manish   Singhvi,   learned   counsel   for   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappellants,   Mr.   Dipankar   Gupta,   learned   senior   counsel   for \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrespondent   Nos.   1-6   and   Ms.   Bhati,   learned   counsel   for   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nintervenor.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(4)    The   main   issue   in   these   appeals   is   about   the   grant   of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n460.15   bighas   of   land   on   23.04.1969   by   the  PHED  to   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrespondents   herein.     As   far   as   the   remaining   land   of   143 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbighas   is   concerned,   even   the   Division   Bench   of   the   High \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCourt,   in   the   impugned   order,   remitted   the   matter   to   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRevenue Minister.  Inasmuch as the issue of remaining land of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n143   bighas   raised   by   the   respondents   is   pending   before   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nRevenue   Minister,   the   same   is   not   relevant   for   our   present \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(5)    It   is   the   contention   of   the   learned   counsel   for   the   State \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   the   order   dated   23.04.1969   about   the   grant   of   603.16 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbighas of land (including 460.15 bighas - the subject matter of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npresent proceedings) was ex facie without jurisdiction as it was \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nallotted   by   the  PHED  on  flimsy   and  fallacious   grounds  about \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncancellation   of   patta   way   back   in   the   year   1942   and   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompensation sought in the year 1968.   It is relevant to note \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat the same was cancelled way back in 1973.   Inasmuch as \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopportunity of hearing was not given, the learned single Judge \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof the High Court, by order dated 24.11.1976, remanded back \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto the State Government for     deciding the matter afresh after \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngiving due opportunity of hearing to the respondents herein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(6)    On   behalf   of   the   State,   it   was   pointed   out   that   it   has \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlegitimate   grievance   with   the   allotment   dated   23.04.1969   by \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  PHED.     The cancellation was made way back in the year \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1942   for   allotment   made   in   the   year   1941   on   the   ground   of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nviolation   of   lease   conditions.     The   respondents   have   claimed \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhuge   compensation   for   construction   said   to   have   been   made \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nduring   subsistence   of   lease   in   the   year   1949   itself   and   filed \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplication for compensation with regard to the cancellation of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npatta   in   the   year   1968.     According   to   the   State,   the   said \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplication   was   barred   by   limitation   and   it   was   also   filed \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbefore wrong forum, i.e., the PHED, when it should have been \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfiled   before   the   Land   Revenue   Department,   which   is   the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappropriate Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(7)    It   is   also   the   grievance   of   the   State   that   the   allotment \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndated 23.04.1969  was cancelled on 01.05.1973,  however, the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHigh   Court   set   aside   the   same   on   24.11.1976   on   the   limited \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nground that there was violation of natural justice and directed \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   State   Government   to   decide   it   afresh   after   giving \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopportunity   of   hearing.     In   those   circumstances,   the   State \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwants to exercise its power under the Land Revenue Act read \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith the orders passed by the learned single Judge of the High \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCourt   dated   24.11.1976   and   the   Revenue   Minister   dated \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15.12.1992.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(8)    It   was   highlighted   that   the   judgment   of   the   trial   Court \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndated 30.06.1982 is also nullity since there was no discussion \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non   merits   with   regard   to   the   validity   of   allotment   dated \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n23.04.1969. Though it was pointed out by the counsel for the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrespondents that it was hit by the principle of  res judicata  as \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclarified by the counsel for the appellants, the principle of  res  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njudicata shall only apply if there is discussion or finding on the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsame   subject   matter.     A   perusal   of   the   decree   of   injunction \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   had   been   passed   on   23.04.1969   shows   that   it   did   not \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadvert to the merits of the case at all.  It is also not in dispute \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   the   subject   Property - Notice for reviewing - Objections against the notice for reviewing the request permitted by High Court - Hence, introduce claim - Held, arrive being referred to has a place with the Revenue Department of the State of Rajasthan and the PHED had no purview at all to reestablish 460.15 bighas of land for the Respondents - It was unnecessary to specify that while passing crisp requests as coordinated, the State Government needed to issue notice to every one of the gatherings concerned and choose the same as per law - Appeals permitted. Appeals Allowed','Dahyabhai Ranchhoddas Dhobi &amp; Anr Vs State Of Gujarat &amp; Ors P. Sathasivam, J.\n\n1) Leave granted.\n\n2) This appeal is directed against the judgment and order\n\ndated 12.01.2009 passed by the High Court of Gujarat at\n\nAhmedabad in Special Civil Application No. 5663 of 1990\n\nwith Civil Application No. 3458 of 2006 whereby the High\n\nCourt dismissed the petition preferred by the appellants\n\nherein.\n\n\n\n\n \n3) Brief facts:\n\na)   According to the appellants, they are owners of the\n\nland in question measuring 848.66 sq.m., Nandh No.\n\n2190/P, Ward No.4 of Surat City.        The State of Gujarat\n\ninitiated   acquisition   proceedings    under   the   Land\n\nAcquisition Act, 1894 (hereinafter referred to as the \"Act\")\n\nfor construction of a school in the land in question under\n\nthe Surat Municipal Corporation. The appellants objected\n\nto the said acquisition on the ground that:\n\n(i) this is the only land for them for carrying on the\n\nbusiness of washermen and they are using this land for\n\nthe purpose of their livelihood.\n\n(ii) There are vacant/open lands adjoining to the land in\n\nquestion.\n\n(iii) Within a radius of 1 km., number of schools are\n\navailable particularly being run by the Surat Municipal\n\nCorporation.\n\n\n\n\n \n(iv) While acquiring the land, the respondents have not\n\nfollowed the provisions of Sections 4, 5, 6 and 11A of the\n\nAct.\n\nb)     On the other hand, it is the stand of the State\n\nGovernment that:\n\n(i) the land is required for establishing a primary school by\n\nthe Surat Municipal Corporation.\n\n(ii) They fully complied with the statutory notices and\n\nother requirements.\n\n(iii) The appellants did not avail the opportunity of\n\nparticipating in the 5A enquiry by filing objections.\n\n(iv) The declaration made under Section 6 of the Act is\n\nwithin time.\n\n(v) Award under Section 11A has been passed within the\n\nstatutory period. Since the establishment of school is for\n\na public purpose and in view of compliance of all the\n\nstatutory formalities, there is no merit in the appeal and\n\nprayed for dismissal of the same.\n\n\n\n\n \n4)   Heard Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel for\n\nthe appellants and Mr. Prashant G. Desai, learned senior\n\ncounsel for the Surat Municipal Corporation and Ms.\n\nHemantika Wahi, learned counsel for the State of Gujarat.\n\n5)   Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel for the\n\nappellants has raised the following contentions:\n\na)   there was no hearing/enquiry in terms of Section 5A\n\nof the Act which is mandatory;\n\nb)   the locality publication was not effected under\n\nSection 6(2);\n\nc)   the Award passed under Section 11A was not made\n\nwithin two years from the date of last publication of\n\nnotification under Section 6, therefore the acquisition is\n\nvitiated;\n\nd)   after change of classification of the land in question,\n\nnamely, residential use, the respondents are not permitted\n\nto establish a primary school which is not permissible;\n\ne)   In view of the fact that the area being designated as\n\nresidential congested by houses on either side, it is not a\n\n \nfit place for establishing a school as observed by this\n\nCourt in Avinash Mehrotra vs. Union of India and\n\nOthers, (2009) 6 SCC 398.\n\n6)   On the other hand, Mr. Prashant G. Desai, learned\n\nsenior counsel for the Surat Municipal Corporation has\n\nsubmitted that in view of Section 12 (2) (b) and Section 20\n\n(1) of the Gujarat Town Planning &amp; Urban Development\n\nAct, 1976, the State Government is well within their\n\npowers in establishing a primary school in Surat.       He\n\nfurther submitted that all the statutory provisions have\n\nbeen strictly complied with and the declaration under\n\nSection 6 and Award under Section 11A were duly made\n\nwithin the prescribed time. Ms. Hemantika Wahi, learned\n\ncounsel appearing for the State, by drawing our attention\n\nto specific averments in the counter affidavit submitted\n\nthat the appellants having not filed objections in the\n\nenquiry under Section 5A, all the three modes of\n\npublication as contemplated under Section 6 were duly\n\npublished and made and Award passed within the\n\n \nprescribed period, there is no infirmity in the acquisition\n\nproceedings and prayed for dismissal of the appeal.\n\n7)   We    have    considered     the   rival   contentions   and\n\nperused the relevant materials.\n\n8)   With regard to the first objection as to enquiry under\n\nSection 5A of the Act though the appellants have stated\n\nthat they were not given an opportunity of being heard, in\n\nthe counter affidavit filed by the Special Land Acquisition\n\nOfficer,   Surat   before   the   High    Court    it   has   been\n\nspecifically asserted that notification under Section 4 in\n\nthe Official Gazette was published on 09.03.1989, public\n\nnotice displayed at the office of Mamlatdar of the\n\nconcerned Ward on 20.04.1989 and hearing of objections\n\nunder Section 5A was fixed on 20.05.1989. In para 4 of\n\nthe counter affidavit, the Land Acquisition Officer has\n\nspecifically stated that appellants were given several\n\nopportunities for hearing their objections from time to\n\ntime. The hearing was fixed on 29.05.1989, 05.06.1989,\n\n12.06.1989, 20.09.1989, 28.09.1989 and 16.10.1989 and\n\n \nthe appellants were heard through their lawyer Mr.\n\nKashyap H. Shukla.           In view of the above specific\n\ninformation the contention contrary to the same is liable\n\nto be rejected.\n\n9)   The second objection is that locality publication was\n\nnot effected under Section 6(2) of the Act.       In the same\n\ncounter   affidavit,   the   Land   Acquisition   Officer   has\n\nasserted that publication of notification under Section 6\n\nwas published in the Gazette dated 21.03.1990.          Public\n\nNotice displayed at the office of Mamlatdar of the\n\nconcerned Ward on 19.04.1990. In the light of the said\n\ninformation, the claim that no publication of notice in the\n\nlocality under Section 6(2) cannot be accepted.\n\n10) The third and the important objection relates to\n\npassing of Award under Section 11A. It is the stand of the\n\nappellants that Award was not made within two years\n\nfrom the date of last publication of Notification under\n\nSection 6 hence the acquisition is vitiated.      Since heavy\n\nreliance was placed on the said objection, it is useful to\n\n \nrefer Section 6 and Section 11A of the Act which reads\n\nthus:\n\n    \"6. Declaration that land is required for a public\n    purpose.- (1) Subject to the provision of Part VII of this Act,\n    when the appropriate Government is satisfied, after\n    considering the report, if any, made under section 5A, sub-\n    section (2), that any particular land is needed for a public\n    purpose, or for a Company, a declaration shall be made to\n    that effect under the signature of a Secretary to such\n    Government or of some officer duly authorized to certify its\n    orders and different declarations may be made from time to\n    time in respect of different parcels of any land covered by the\n    same notification under section 4, sub-section (1)\n    irrespective of whether one report or different reports has or\n    have been made (wherever required) under section 5A, sub-\n    section (2);\n\n    Provided that no declaration in respect of any particular\n    land covered by a notification under section 4, sub-section\n    (1)-\n\n    (i) published after the commencement of the Land\n    Acquisition (Amendment and Validation) Ordinance, 1967 (1\n    of 1967), but before the commencement of the Land\n    Acquisition (Amendment) Act, 1984 shall be made after the\n    expiry of three years from the date of the publication of the\n    notification; or\n\n    (ii) published after the commencement of the Land\n    Acquisition (Amendment) Act, 1984 shall be made after the\n    expiry of one year from the date of the publication of the\n    notification:\n\n    Provided further that no such declaration shall be made\n    unless the compensation to be awarded for such property is\n    to be paid by a Company, or wholly or partly out of public\n    revenues or some fund controlled or managed by a local\n    authority.\n\n    Explanation 1. - In computing any of the periods referred to\n    in the first proviso, the period during which any action or\n    proceeding to be taken in pursuance of the notification\n    issued under section 4, sub-section (1), is stayed by an order\n\n\n \nof a Court shall be excluded.\n\nExplanation 2. - Where the compensation to be awarded for\nsuch property is to be paid out of the funds of a corporation\nowned or controlled by the State, such compensation shall\nbe deemed to be compensation paid out of public revenues.\n\n(2) Every declaration shall be published in the Official\nGazette, and in two daily newspapers circulating in the\nlocality in which the land is situated of which at least one\nshall be in the regional language, and the Collector shall\ncause public notice of the substance of such declaration to\nbe given at convenient places in the said locality (the last of\nthe dates of such publication and the giving of such public\nnotice, being hereinafter referred to as the date of the\npublication of the declaration), and such declaration shall\nstate the district or other territorial division in which the\nland is situate, the purpose for which it is needed, its\napproximate area, and, where a plan shall have been made\nof the land, the place where such plan may be inspected.\n\n(3) The said declaration shall be conclusive evidence that the\nland is needed for a public purpose or for a company, as the\ncase may be; and, after making such declaration, the\nappropriate Government may acquire the land in manner\nhereinafter appearing.\n\n11A. Period within which an award shall be made.- (1) The\nCollector shall make an award under section 11 within a\nperiod of two years from the date of the publication of the\ndeclaration and if no award is made within that period, the\nentire proceeding for the acquisition of the land shall lapse:\n\nProvided that in a case where the said declaration has been\npublished before the commencement of the Land Acquisition\n(Amendment) Act, 1984, the award shall be made within a\nperiod of two years from such commencement.\n\nExplanation - In computing the period of two years referred\nto in this section, the period during which any action or\nproceeding to be taken in pursuance of the said declaration\nis stayed by an order of a Court shall be excluded.\"\n\n\n\n\n \n11) These provisions were considered by this Court in\n\nvarious decisions.       In Krishi Utpadan Mandi Samiti\n\nand Another vs. Makrand Singh and Others, (1995) 2\n\nSCC 497, the question that was posed for consideration\n\nwas whether the High Court was right in its conclusion\n\nthat the declaration under Section 6 was published after\n\nthree years and the last of the publications shall be the\n\nlast date for the purpose of computing three years&apos; period\n\nenvisaged in clause (i) of the proviso to sub-section (1) of\n\nSection 6 of the Act as amended by Land Acquisition\n\n(Amendment) Act, 1984. The discussion and conclusion\n\nin paras 4 and 5 are relevant:\n\n     \"4. The question, therefore, is that which date of the\n     publications in three steps i.e. publication in the Gazette,\n     two newspapers and local publication to be the last date for\n     the purpose of computing three years&apos; limitation prescribed\n     in clause (i) of the proviso to Section 6(1) of the Act. Prima\n     facie, it gives an impression that the last of any of the three\n     steps puts in motion, the running of limitation of three\n     years. But on deeper probe, it does not appear to be so and\n     such a construction would easily defeat the public purpose\n     and deflects the course of justice. So it is necessary to\n     understand the scheme and policy of the Act to get the crux\n     of the question. It is seen that sub-section (1) of Section 4\n     gives power of eminent domain to the State to acquire the\n     land, whenever it appears to it that the land is needed or\n     likely to be needed for any public purpose or for any\n     company, by a notification published in the Official Gazette\n\n\n \nand two daily newspapers circulating in that area and at\nleast one of them should be in the regional language and\nalso the Collector is enjoined to cause public notice of the\nsubstance of notification to be given at convenient places in\nthe said locality in which the land is situated. It is also\nmentioned thereunder that the last date of such publication\nand the giving of such public notice \"being hereinafter\nreferred to\" as the date of publication of the notification. It\nwould be seen that the purpose of notification under Section\n4(1) is an intimation to the owner or person having an\ninterest in the land that Government exercised the power of\neminent domain in relation to his land and for public\npurpose his land is needed or likely to be needed; puts an\nembargo on his freedom to deal with the land as an\nunencumbered land and also pegs the price of the land\nprevailing as on that date. It also is a caveat to the Collector\nto make the award under Section 11 as well as to determine\nthe market value prevailing as on the last of the dates to be\nthe date and the award should be made within a period\nprescribed by Section 11-A, lest the entire acquisition shall\nstand lapsed. The word `hereinafter&apos; is for such purposes as\nwell as for the purpose of determination of the compensation\nunder Chapter III of the Act as well. Therefore, the word\n`hereinafter&apos; referred to as the last date of the publication of\nthe notification is the date from which the prevailing prices\nof the land is to be computed etc.\n\n\n5. Clause (i) of the proviso to Section 6(1) mandates the\npublication of the declaration in the Official Gazette and it\nshould be within three years from the date of the publication\nof the notification under Section 4(1) i.e. the last of the dates\nreferred to in Section 4(1). The word `publish&apos; emphasises the\nact accomplished i.e. declaration under Section 6(1) being\npublished in the Official Gazette. The last date under Section\n6(2) shall be the date for the purposes \"hereinafter referred\nto\" would be not for computing the period of three years\nprescribed in clause (i) of proviso to Section 6(1) of the Act as\nit was already done, but purposes to be followed hereinafter.\nOtherwise language would have been \"hereinbefore done\".\nSub-section (2) as such did not prescribe any limitation\nwithin which the declaration under Section 6(1) or other\nsteps hereinafter to be taken, in other words, the steps to be\ntaken thereafter in making the award under Section 11 or in\ncomputation of the period prescribed in Section 11-A. The\npublication of the declaration in two daily newspapers\nhaving circulation in the locality one of which is in the\nregional language and the publication of the substance of\n\n\n \n    the declaration in the locality are ministerial acts and is a\n    procedural part. It appears that these publications are\n    required to be done to make the declaration published in the\n    manner, to be conclusive evidence of the public purpose\n    under Section 6(1) and also to provide limitation to make the\n    award under Section 11 by the Collector. In other words, the\n    limitation prescribed under Section 11-A is for the purpose\n    of making the award and if the Collector fails to do so, the\n    entire proceeds under Sections 4(1) and 6(1) shall stand\n    lapsed. If this consistent policy of the Act is understood\n    giving teeth to the operational efficacy to the scheme of the\n    Act and public purpose the Act seeks to serve, we are of the\n    considered view that publication in the Official Gazette\n    already made under clause (i) of proviso to sub-section (1) of\n    Section 6 is complete, as soon as the declaration under\n    Section 6(1) was published in the Official Gazette. That will\n    be the date for the purpose of computation of three years&apos;\n    period from the last of the dates of the publication of the\n    notification under Section 4(1). The procedural ministerial\n    acts prescribed under sub-section (2) are only for the\n    purpose of the procedure to be followed `hereinafter&apos;, in other\n    words, the steps to be taken subsequent to the publication of\n    the declaration under Section 6(1) of t Property - Validity of securing procedures - Sections 4, 5A, 6, 6 and 11A Land Acquisition Act, 1894 - Acquisition procedures were started under the Land Acquisition Act for development of a school on the land under the Surat Municipal Corporation - Appellants the proprietors, tested the obtaining on grounds procurement not done according to arrangements set down under the Act and honor was not made inside two years from the date of last production of Notification under Section 6 subsequently, the obtaining is vitiated - High Court rejected the request of favored by the Appellants - Hence exhibit Appeal — Whether High court was supported in expelling the appeal to favored by the Appellants - Held, notice under Section 4 in the Official Gazette was distributed, open notice was shown at the workplace of Mamlatdar of the concerned Ward and knowing about protests under Section 5A was additionally settled and the Appellants were given a few open doors for hearing their complaints now and again — Notification under Section 6 was keep going distributed on nineteenth April, 1990 and in this manner the time of two years stipulated in Section 11A would start to keep running from nineteenth April, 1990 and, along these lines, the distribution of the Award under Section 11 of the Act on eighteenth April, 1992 was inside the stipulated time point of confinement of two years - Land being referred to kept under booking for school in the endorsed improvement anticipate the State Government under Section 17 of the Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Act, it is the obligation of the Corporation to gain the land for actualizing the arrangements of the same - No Interference with the Order of High court - Appeal expelled \r\n\r\nProperty - \"Need\" and \"need\" - Appellant fought that in perspective of presence of many schools in and around the region, there is no compelling reason to build up a school in the place that is known for the Appellants - Held, In regard of \"need\" and \"need\", it is for the Government and their specialists to take a choice considering different angles - If such a choice is taken in view of materials it is not for the Court to question their case - Appeal expelled ','Arjun Singh Vs State Of H.P Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.\n\n\n\n\n1.    Leave granted.\n\n\n\n2.    Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a learned Single Judge\n\nof the Himachal Pradesh High Court upholding the conviction of the\n\nappellant for offences punishable under Sections 376, 511, 363 and 366 as\n\nwell as Section 109 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short the `IPC&apos;). He\nwas sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 7 years, 3 years, 4\n\nyears, 5 years and 7 years for the aforesaid offences alongwith fine with\n\ndefault stipulation.\n\n\n\n3.    Prosecution version as unfolded during trial is as follows:\n\n\n\n      On 18.7.1999, the victim (PW10) boarded the bus to Shimla from\n\nSolan. When the bus bearing registration No. HP-12-4113 reached near\n\npetrol pump (HIMFED) situated near Nav Bahar towards Chotta Shimla, all\n\nthe passengers got down, except the prosecutrix and accused-appellant\n\nArjun Singh. Accused Arjun Singh committed forcible sexual intercourse\n\nwith the prosecutrix against her will and without her consent. The victim\n\nwas kidnapped by the accused who was minor at the time of kidnapping in\n\nbus No.HP-12-4113 from Solan. The accused had induced the prosecutrix\n\nthat he would marry her after reaching Nalagarh. The FIR was registered.\n\nThereafter the investigation was carried out and the challan was put in the\n\nCourt. The appellant was charged for offences punishable under Sections\n\n376, 511, 366 and 109 of the Indian Penal Code. The prosecution examined\n\n15 witnesses to prove its case. The appellant had examined Shri Arvind\n\nSharma (DW 1) as defence witness. The learned Additional Sessions Judge,\n\n\n\n \nSolan, convicted and sentenced the accused as stated above. The sentences\n\nwere directed to run concurrently. It is to be noted that two persons faced\n\ntrial for the aforesaid offences i.e. appellant who was the conductor of the\n\nvehicle, and one Daler Singh who was the driver of the vehicle. Since\n\naccused persons abjured guilt, trial was held. The trial court placed reliance\n\non the evidence of the prosecutrix (PW1) and her mother (PW 3). As a plea\n\nrelating to the age of the prosecutrix to show that she was a consenting party\n\nwas taken, the person who had issued the date of birth certificate was\n\nexamined as PW 4. According to the said certificate the date of birth was\n\n19th October, 1984. She was admitted to the school on 1st April, 1997 and\n\nhad left it on 24th October, 1998. The trial Court held that the age of the\n\nvictim was less than 16 years and placed reliance on the documents\n\nproduced. It was also submitted by the accused persons that no rape has\n\nbeen committed. This plea also was rejected by the trial court.\n\n\n\n      Accordingly the trial court while holding the appellant guilty,\n\nacquitted co-accused. As noted above, appeal before the High Court was\n\ndismissed.\n\n\n\n\n \n4.    In support of the appeal the stand taken before the trial court and the\n\nHigh Court were reiterated.\n\n\n\n5.    Learned counsel for the respondent-State supported the judgment of\n\nthe High Court.\n\n\n\n6.    So far as the age aspect is concerned in Vishnu v. State of\n\nMaharashtra [2006(1) SCC 283] it was inter alia held as follows:\n\n\n                \"20. It is urged before us by Mr Lalit that the\n             determination of the age of the prosecutrix by\n             conducting ossification test is scientifically proved and,\n             therefore, the opinion of the doctor that the girl was of\n             18-19 years of age should be accepted. We are unable to\n             accept this contention for the reasons that the expert\n             medical evidence is not binding on the ocular evidence.\n             The opinion of the Medical Officer is to assist the court\n             as he is not a witness of fact and the evidence given by\n             the Medical Officer is really of an advisory character and\n             not binding on the witness of fact.\"\n\n\n\n\n7.    In State of Chhattisgarh v. Lekhram [2006(5) SCC 736] it was held\n\nthat the register maintained in a school is admissible evidence to prove the\n\ndate of birth of the person concerned in terms of Section 35 of the Indian\n\nEvidence Act, 1872 (in short `Evidence Act&apos;). It may be true that in the\n\nentry of the school register is not conclusive but it has evidentiary value.\n\n \n8.    Learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that the evidence of\n\nthe Doctor clearly rules out the commission of rape. The Medical officer\n\n(PW 9) has stated that rape had not been committed and sexual intercourse\n\nhad not taken place.\n\n\n\n9.    The offence of rape occurs in Chapter XVI of IPC. It is an offence\n\naffecting the human body. In that Chapter, there is a separate heading for\n\n`Sexual offence&apos;, which encompasses Sections 375, 376, 376-A, 376-B,\n\n376-C, and 376-D. `Rape&apos; is defined in Section 375. Sections 375 and 376\n\nhave been substantially changed by Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1983,\n\nand several new sections were introduced by the new Act, i.e. 376-A, 376-\n\nB, 376-C and 376-D. The fact that sweeping changes were introduced\n\nreflects the legislative intent to curb with iron hand, the offence of rape\n\nwhich affects the dignity of a woman. The offence of rape in its simplest\n\nterm is `the ravishment of a woman, without her consent, by force, fear or\n\nfraud&apos;, or as `the carnal knowledge of a woman by force against her will&apos;.\n\n`Rape&apos; or `Raptus&apos; is when a man hath carnal knowledge of a w (1) Indian Penal Code, 1860 - Sections 376, 511, 365, 366 and 109- - Rape, and so forth.- - Conviction and sentence - Whether subject to obstruction?- - Held, \"halfway\"- - Rape does not seem to have been conferred - But rather endeavor to submit assault - Clearly settled - Hence, offense under Section 376 not made out- - But rather that under Section 511 obviously made out- - In foundation of certainties of case, Section 109 has no application - Appellant properly indicted and sentenced for offenses under Sections 365, 366 and 511- - But his conviction under Sections 109 and 376 unsustainable- - But put aside. \r\n\r\n(2) Evidence Act, 1872- - Sections 3 and 9- - Appreciation of proof - Evidence of therapeutic officer on age- - Really of counseling character- - And not official on observer of actuality. ','Karnataka Industrial Areas Vs Nandi Cold Storage Pvt. Ltd J U D G M E N T I.A. NO.1 IN CIVIL APPEAL NO. 5542 OF 2004 Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.\r\n\r\n1. Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission at New Delhi (in short the &#39;National Commission&#39;). Respondent had filed a complaint against the appellant before the National Commission.\r\n\r\n2. Background facts in a nutshell are as follows:\r\n\r\n3. In the complaint respondent inter alia stated as follows:\r\n\r\nThe complainant company, desirous of opening a cold storage unit in the State of Karnataka, applied for allotment of land to the appellant in August 1991. After meeting all the formalities required from time to time by the appellant, a plot bearing No.2 of Chickballapur Industrial Area, measuring 2.5 acre of land, was allotted for setting up a cold storage. Possession certificate was issued on 26/30.8.93. The complainant also in the meantime obtained a loan of Rs.67 lakh from the Karnataka State Financial Corporation (in short &#39;KFC&#39;). For the first time in August 1994, a letter was written by appellant to the complainant that &quot;the company could not go ahead with construction activity on the plot allotted as the erstwhile land owner of plot No.2 covered in Sy.No.29 and 30 of Jadalathimmanahally Village has obtained stay order from the High Court of Karnataka in W.P.No.70/88 challenging the acquisition proceedings. The Board initiated action for vacating the stay order granted by the High Court of Karnataka. However, the company could not go ahead with implementation in view of the stay order granted by the High Court. The complainant sought for permission to go ahead with implementation after the litigation in respect of the above land is disposed of by the High Court. The Board should also grant extension of time to the company for implementation of the project after disposal of the litigation.\r\n\r\n4. Original land holder took back possession forcibly in view of the order of the Karnataka High Court. The writ petition filed by the original land holder was allowed by the High Court leaving the complainant high and dry without land, more so when in September 1994, the KFC cancelled the term loan in view of the fact that no progress was made in the implementation of the project. Since the complainant was keen to go ahead with the project, on collecting some information, it approached the appellant to allot plot No.1-A and 1-B which was lying vacant, which were allotted to the complainant in 1995. But it seems that bad luck had not stopped chasing the complainant. As soon as the allotment in respect of plot no.1- A and 1-B were made on a resumed plot, the original allottees moved the High Court making the complainant a party before it. However, after protracted litigation, the writ petition was dismissed but in the meanwhile the loans had been cancelled and the complain Consumer Protection Act, 1986 - Sections 2 (1) (g) and 21- - Deficiency in administration - Allotment of plot for setting up mechanical units- - About insufficiency in administration, adjust approach received by National Commission - However, remuneration
